<p><strong>voice</strong>: The Black Panthers…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: People still ask me how it all started? How
things went so far? And like a lot of questions about the Panthers,
there are different answers. Different beginnings…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What became the Black Panthers really started
with just two guys – Bobby Seale and Huey Newton – saying two words:
“Defend Yourselves…” Legend has it they met at some coffee house where
Bobby was running down a rhyme…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh yeah. Yeah it’s easy to see right on your
black and white TV. Black man. Blue cop. Red blood. Niggers watch other
niggers die. That’s right Niggers watching niggers die. That’s the
American way…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Pigs threw them in jail. There they starting
talking about black folks oughta start standing up. No master plan, no
pot to piss in, nothing like that. Just two fed-up brothers… Next thing
you know, you got the Black Panther Party for Self Defense…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For me, it started different. A lot
different. You may as well say The Panthers started in my front
yard…</p>
<p><strong>shapely woman</strong>: Shucks I see you staring, but I ain’t
letting go. Them hips is almost forty years old but the hat is brand
new!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes indeed, that Bitter Dog… What’s up little
brother?</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: I’m telling you, man. The perfect gift for the
sophisticated lady in your life. Light up her flame with some solid gold
satisfaction and get a second one half price for your wife. Can’t beat
my price with a stick, baby.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Sabu, why’re you still tryin’ to sell these
raggedy ass, non workin’ Korean lighters man?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh lord… not again…</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: God damn… Kid never had a chance…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Mothafuck… Hey!!! What the hell!!!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: People were pissed off. Neighborhood had been
begging for a stoplight since before dirt was invented. Way I saw it
then, that boy dying was another shitty thing in a world full of
shit.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Way I see it now… That day. That
intersection. That’s where it started for me. Only, I didn’t know it
then…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka.
What you do in ’Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: All of the above, man… And then some.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Tell me, don’t you fine black men got
anything better to do than play games?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Sure I do, but your sister’s busy. Gimme the
damn ball.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Here… Take it. I thought some righteous
brothers like you might help us out, but I guess that ain’t you…</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Help who? With what?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Your community! That’s who. Maybe you didn’t
know but a kid died today.</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: That’s three this year… same spot.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Damn straight. And old Reverend Slocum’s
having a vigil on that corner, trying to get a stoplight put in.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: My Mom’s at that.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Funny you don’t look like church folk to
me.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Oh I ain’t. But it seems The Man’s getting
uptight about black folk standing in the street, causing a fuss. What
I’m asking for, is some of your able black asses to come down and be
“Observers” on the cops. Take down badge numbers. They don’t like
pulling shit with too many eyes on ’em. So that’s how you can help, not
by praying but by watching.</p>
<p><strong>drinker #1</strong>: Not me. This able black ass ain’t
fucking with no cops.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Look, I understand but if some Blacks insist
on trying to interact with the white man, that’s not our concern. We are
African, “brother.” Mother Africa is the only…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: No, you look, you phony ass boojie nigger.
We ain’t in Africa, we’re in Oakland. And in Oakland we got police
brutality. We got the white man interacting his billy club up against
the black man’s head. Now if that don’t bother you, then take your skirt
wearing ass back to Africa… “Uncle.”</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Try it.</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: Chickenshit boojie…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What about you two? You were there, you saw
that kid?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I saw… but…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: But nothing… you do live here don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah, I do.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Well, act like it. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You young niggas crazy. The Man ain’t gonna
let us have no say in running shit! Keep it up and he’s gonna come down
on our ass like a ton of bricks…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Don’t let the cops provoke you. We’re there
to watch and take badge numbers…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: And who is we?</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: Brother where you been? We’re the
Black Panthers.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: The Panthers… How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: Sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Shit, we made him get his moms to give
permission before he could sign up.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Just a kid.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids
too.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I thought you said all the Panthers were
gonna be here.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What you see is what you got. That’s’ Bobby
Seale.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Carter… buddy of mine from way back… And
Gene…</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: And that… that’s Huey…</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Ain’t too many of you is there?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Only takes a single grain of sand to move
the world…</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: Heads up!!!!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. schreck</strong>: What in the Sam Hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: A vigil for some pickaninny got hit
here.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. schreck</strong>: Vigil my ass…</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Listen up, you all have 30 seconds to
disperse and return to your homes.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Failure to do so will result in your
immediate arrest…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Go on get your black hide outta here…</p>
<p><strong>bullhorn</strong>: You are resisting arrest!…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Oh shit Mom…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: The power structure locks the black man up.
That’s right. We move from chains to bars and locks. Kangaroo courts put
brothers in jail. No jury of our peers. No jury of black folks. How do
we stop this insanity? It’s simple. Organization. That’s the key. We
must organize. We must maintain discipline…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: That’s right brother… listen and learn.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: The white power structure wants us to act like
savages. But we’re a different kind of animal altogether. We’re
Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully
aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment
for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to
organize, we keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve
the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs. Power to the
people baby…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Power? Shit, old folks can’t even sing without
getting their asses kicked.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Well, then like the man said… Maybe it’s time
we stop singing and start swinging.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah, but they got the guns.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: We can change that. We got the right to bear
arms, so I’d say it’s time to exercise that right. Like Comrade Mao
says, “Justice through power, Power through guns.”</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Chickenshits, just harassing our ass, we
weren’t breaking any law.</p>
<p><strong>rev. slocum</strong>: But at least we’re free! God has
delivered us from the lion’s den.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Free? We’re back where we started. Shit we
still don’t have a stop light.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help
themselves. We’ll be our own stoplight.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Check it out… Great huh? I tell you those guys
know what time it is. Man I’m with that…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t know. Look around man.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: C’mon Judge we got to start somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah, and I’m gonna start by getting on my
feet. Working on things from inside the system.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Inside ain’t in the system. It’s right there
inside you!! I’m joining up.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I… I gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: It’s okay Mom. I’m allright.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You don’t look alright.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah… cop hit me…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I saw. I saw that big one hit that police man.
Saw ’em drag you off too. They take you to jail?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Lord, never thought I’d live to see my boy in
prison.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mom! It wasn’t like that. It was bullsh… They
were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You meet those friends of yours in jail
too?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes… No… Mom it’s not like you think. They’re
alright. There out there trying to do something.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I hear them boys, those Black Panthers,
they’re communists. They don’t even believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mom, black folks been praying to God for four
hundred years. Maybe it’s time we tried something else…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t know. I really don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ll tell you one thing Judge…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Them boys gonna start a bunch of trouble they
keep on like that.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Those things don’t work…</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Don’t I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers.
Sit down. Always a… pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: It’s a bit more like how can we help you.
Bay Area’s become quite a hornet’s nest in terms of subversive
activities. And… well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be
happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly
advisory basis… of course.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer,
but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you
guys already have under surveillance. They’re still doing a lot of
yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: I see. What about the Black Panther Party
for Self-Defense?</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark
caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They’re loud, but they
aren’t dangerous,</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Can you make a deal with them?</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Naw… They’re kids mostly. Idealists. They
actually think they’re for real.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Hmmm. As you know the Bureau – and
Mr. Hoover – is particularly “sensitive” to anything that might agitate
or solidify the coloreds on the left.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: You want me to put a man on it?</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: That would be an excellent start. Tell him
to keep a low profile.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: What do you want? Panama Red? I can get you
Panama Red Sinsemilla? Got a line on some chocolate hash… get you high
as a motherfucking monkey…</p>
<p><strong>white hippie</strong>: Uhh… man I was wondering… can you get
some Cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Coke? Shee-it. Yeah, I can get you cocaine.
But it’s dangerous. Cops everywhere. Gimme twenty dollars and meet me
back here in an hour. And don’t fuck around white boy, this is the
serious shit.</p>
<p><strong>white hippie</strong>: Uh okay, alright. You’ll be here in an
hour?</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Yeah I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Now that was one dumb motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain’t nobody
gonna push on this street.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Shit, I ain’t doing nothing. White bread asks
for cocaine, I take his money. Shit… you know… It was just a hustle.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Sabu… High white dude’s the only thing you could
hustle.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Man… fuck you. Why you always bustin’ my
balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain’t doing
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: I dig, you just hustling. But you make sure
it stays like that brother, or you will have much grief on your sorry
ass.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Motherfucking Panthers, worse than the
police…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What’s the matter Casper, you lost or
something?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Hey! I’m talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Ohhhh… Looky there… It’s a Cop…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: …Yeah, it’s a perfect next step, let the
community know that we’re dedicated to Malcolm’s ideals… Damn where’s
Bobby Seale?</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: Huey!! Man you gotta check this out…
You’re gonna love…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Hold up a second… We got a decision to
make.</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Dig it, you know those brothers over in San
Fran… call themselves the Black Panthers too?</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: Sure, those boojie jokers don’t do
anything except print up a lotta paper saying “Black is Beautiful.”</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah… but it seems they’re bringing Malcolm’s
widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for
Ramparts. And they want us to help with security.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well if anyone’s gonna protect Malcolm’s
legacy it better be us.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Damn straight… Let’s go check out these Paper
Panthers.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Greetings African brothers… You’re here to help
us with Sister Shabazz no doubt?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Fucking boojie…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: That’s right. We’d be proud to provide as
escort for Malcolm’s widow. How many men you got?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you’re at
it. Men? Well we can spare six for security…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: No thank you sister. Six?!! That seems a
little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at
least twenty men. And that’s twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I assure you that we as the revolutionary
vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We’ll be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: They ain’t fit for the name Panthers.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Twenty men? I don’t know if we got that.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: We’ll get them. Right now we got to worry
about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure
as hell can’t. We need guns.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: We need money first…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah… Bobby you gotta…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Got it covered Huey, that’s what I was trying
to tell you before. Check it out…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bought every copy in Chinatown. Got us a
discount too, thirty cents a piece.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Here it is Brothers. The Lowdown straight from
comrade Mao’s mouth. If you open the minds, the bodies will follow.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Huey uhhh… these… these guys want to
join…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I’m sorry boys. But right now The Party feels
it’s important for Black People to do it for themselves. We’re not
signing up white folk. But, if you are down with what we’re doing,
organize some righteous white folks. I got a feeling we’re gonna need
each other.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Hey, this what they got you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Party needs the bread. Be hip to the struggle,
only a dollar!!!</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: A dollar? Far out! Is it authentic?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Comrade, this here’s the real deal, straight
from Revolution HQ.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Huh? Hey, I can dig it man. Thanks! Long
live the revolution, brother.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Money’s cool, but what the party really needs is
brothers like you. Judge I could use someone like you. These books, hell
I don’t know half the words. You might.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Have to pass on the revolution today man, I
got class… But how about tonight, I was gonna check out “Cloud Nine.”
Just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Can’t… they’re having a PE meeting at
Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: PE? What? You guys doing gym class?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: No man. PE – “political education.”</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: You’re a smart brother… you should dig what
Huey and Bobby got to say…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Fuck maybe… be there.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Like I said… maybe.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Rose, what the hell you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Just come for the food, man. Ain’t quite sure
what their bag is but…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That one’s one hell of a cook…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: …We… the Black Panther Party are not
anarchists. We want a government that serves the people. In the black
community we want a government that serves black people. Black cops for
Black People. Not the Army we have occupying the community “Army?” you
ask. “What army? This isn’t Vietnam.” Well the Army’s right out your
door folks. They’re the cops.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They’re pigs brothers and sisters. And these
pigs are soldiers fighting against us. Whether you got an Afro or a
process on. Whether a sister’s got her hair straightened or whether
she’s got a natural on. Whether it’s a brother in a dashiki or a pimp
with a sharp suit on. Whether a sister’s prostituting or teaching kids
to read. The pig will murder you because you’re black. No matter what
kind of hair you wear. So we best get ourselves together, organize,
learn our history and put the power in the hands of the black community
before this army, these pigs wipe this community out.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: …Glad you came man.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah, only I figure you’d be the one doing
the speaking.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Not yet, one of these day’s maybe. Bobby’s party
chairman. Political Education’s really his bag.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You’re Cy’s Vietnam buddy right? C’mere I’d
like to talk with you…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You were. infantry right?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: So I guess it’s safe to say you know about
firepower.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Busted firing pin. You want only the legal
stuff right?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Just the legit shit.</p>
<p><strong>mr. yang</strong>: Nothing wrong with that pistol.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Serial number’s been filed. Cop catches you
with that he figures you either stole it or killed someone with it…</p>
<p><strong>mr. yang</strong>: I don’t want no trouble. No cops coming to
me about these guns.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: No trouble here. You got a permit to sell.
We’re buying. All perfectly legal.</p>
<p><strong>mr. yang</strong>: These are worth a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: I thought you were a revolutionary. We
can’t afford em if you don’t cut us some slack. But… you treat us right
and we’ll be doing a lot of business.</p>
<p><strong>mr. yang</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: We appreciate your help with this.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: So what’s the deal?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Freedom… We’re just gonna test some of the
words in that law book.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Judge… we’re doing security for Betty
Shabazz’s visit next week. I’d like to have someone who knows there way
around a pistol there. Someone like you.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You are down for protecting Malcolm’s widow
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah… let me think about it.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Okay man I ain’t going to push. But remember
the revolution isn’t going to wait for anyone. Come on, we’ll give you a
lift.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: No man. Gonna walk.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: This here’s a “Panther Patrol.” We see a
brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don’t go
beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook ’em
up with a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: We’re like policing the police.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Damn straight.</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop #1</strong>: Get me some back up…</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop</strong>: Okay now, er, Huey, so what’s your
telephone number?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I have confirmed to you my address, that’s all
I’m required to by law to do. We have broken no law.</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop</strong>: What are you doing with the gun?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What are doing with yours?.</p>
<p><strong>baby faced cop</strong>: These boys giving you trouble?</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop</strong>: Here’s another one. That your pistol
there?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No! It is not his weapon. A handgun would be
a violation of his probation. It’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop</strong>: Lemme see that rifle son…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: No! This is my private property. According to
California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.</p>
<p><strong>black voice in crowd</strong>: Them’s some badass
niggers…</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Okay. Okay. Move along. Go on about your
business…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Wait!! Brothers! Sisters!! You don’t have to
go anywhere. This is your business. Stay right here. The law says as
long as you keep a reasonable distance, eight to ten feet to be exact,
you’ve got a right to observe the police carrying out their duties. From
what I can see, you’re standing some 22 feet away from this man here. So
brothers ain’t no law being broken.</p>
<p><strong>black voice in crowd</strong>: Talk that good shit
Brother…</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop</strong>: Is that gun loaded BOY?!!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Fish and Game laws clearly state that it is
unlawful to have a live round of ammunition in the chamber of a shotgun
or rifle in a vehicle… PIG!!</p>
<p><strong>black voice in crowd</strong>: Oh sweet Jesus, I do believe I
have died and gone to heaven…</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Refer to him as officer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well then don’t refer to him as BOY!</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop</strong>: Well… is it loaded?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I tell you “officer”, it wasn’t…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: …but now IT IS!</p>
<p><strong>beefy cop</strong>: For the last time Boy!!! What do those
guns mean??!!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party
declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.
We are going to shoot you!!!</p>
<p><strong>black voice in crowd</strong>: Pigs that’s just what the hell
they are!!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Never thought I’d live to see the day! You
know the police ain’t nothing but the KKK with badges.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: One: “We want freedom. We want the power to
determine the destiny of our Black Community.” Two: “We want full
employment for our people.” Three: “We want to end the robbery by the
white man of our Black Community.” Christ, they’re asking for
reparations…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: They couldn’t have thought this up for
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Yeah… Sounds like the Constitution to me.
With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During
your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial
types? Communists?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: No. I’ve seen Black men handing out bags of
food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more
meetings. They ain’t…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: They are carrying guns. They are
threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of
America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties
seriously…</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Now hold on Rodgers…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are
going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in
attitude need to be made…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Like?</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going
to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it’s time for a more active
type of involvement.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Evening Chief. Another hard day keeping the
streets safe?</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: What are you doing out so late?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I like to keep an eye on my “investments” so
to speak. You know we still need to discuss that business expansion we
spoke of.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Look, I don’t think…</p>
<p><strong>trafficante</strong>: That’s a beautiful car. You’d do well
to remember who paid for it. Good night, Chief, we’ll speak again
soon.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All
up on that cop, that was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a
lift?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: You got it. Berkeley?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: No, Panther Headquarters. Least that way we
could hang out more like we used to.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: You joining? My Brother.. My brother.</p>
<p><strong>face #1</strong>: Sign me up!! Just gimme a gun and point out
the cops you want me to shoot…</p>
<p><strong>face #2</strong>: Where’s the free food at?</p>
<p><strong>face #3</strong>: My momma, she marched with King. Don’t know
exactly what kinda change that brought. But man you put that cop on
Grove through some serious changes!!!</p>
<p><strong>face #4</strong>: I hear you Panther boys get the finest
pussy.</p>
<p><strong>face #5</strong>: Vietnam man… I go there and then come back
to some honky motherfucker telling me what to do, beating my ass if I
don’t. Man… fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Judge is gonna join us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Welcome Brother, if we stand together we can
break the chains.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Huey wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: He had a feeling you’d be coming by.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Welcome brother, have you decided to get down
with us?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m down.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah… You were a lot of help with those guns.
Your soldier shit is bad- ass.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’d hoped I was finished with all that.
But…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You know, you’re lucky to be back. Most
niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that’s what they’re there
for.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Don’t I know it. Every brother I knew in
’Nam’s dead. My company… a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less
than a second.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Mind if I ask you something? Why’d you put up
with shit like that for someone else’s war?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I
stuck around here, instead of signing up, I’d probably be in jail, or
sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah I know. You’re smart Judge. You ain’t no
bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every
good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly
soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you,
something real important.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Whatever you need, I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Right on Brother Judge…</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: What would you tell young brothers and
sisters to do in following Brother Malcolm’s footsteps?</p>
<p><strong>betty shabazz</strong>: I’d say that Malcolm lives in each of
us. We all need to work together for the community. Like those brothers
out there are…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Huey…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh oh…</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: What’s going on here son?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: We are breaking no law, you’ve have no right
to detain us.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: There she is!!!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Arrest this man!!!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: If I’m gonna arrest anyone it’s going to be
you…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Not today!!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Don’t point that gun!!!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: That’s right be a smart nigger like your
friend.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: He’s not my friend and I promise you pig. Your
men draw and this will be a blood bath. It’s your call.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Aren’t you going to do anything…</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Like he said asshole, they’re not breaking
any law…</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: You see that on jive dashiki man,
hiding under the desk. Shit paper panthers.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister
Betty’s safe. This was a good day…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: They were empty…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What was empty?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The Paper Panthers’ guns, they weren’t
loaded. I know guns man. Those guns were empty.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Like I say Brothers we are the vanguard. Get me
a beer… I tell you once Cleaver’s story comes out, we’re gonna…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm
X’s widow was on the line today. And your guns weren’t even loaded.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: A gun’s a gun man. It don’t need to be
loaded.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to
Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Wait a second there brother…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: No you wait a second. You and your “Panthers”
got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you
change your name. Or three you face annihilation.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Pretty boy, you’re a long way from Oakland.
Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You’re exactly the kind of brother we don’t
need. Kind of brother who gets others killed. Now you gonna change your
name.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Roy, tell him you’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Please!!! Yes!!! We’ll change the name.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You were alright Judge, better than alright.
You’re what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that’s going to
school not making the man too nervous.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t know about that.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I do. You think you’re smart enough to keep
playing the game?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: What, I don’t know how you mean?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: See, the thing about Panthers. For all their
speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don’t just
go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther
keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he’s backed into a
corner. Then believe me those claws are fierce.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Huey, you’re losing me. What are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I’m talking about survival. Yours, mine, all
of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive
might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we’re
gonna let ’em. But their spy’s gonna be our spy too. How about it?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Me? You’ve got a whole lot of other folks
signing up. Why me?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly
like the kind of nigger they think they can trust…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Get me out man in Oakland…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Alma!? I uhh I don’t think…</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: What do you mean? We’re black ain’t we? And we
care about improving the plight of out people don’t we? Or you figure
oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Uhh… I with it sister but…</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: But nothing, we want full fledged membership
in the Black Panther Party… and none of this “Okay sugah as long as you
stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet” bullshit
either!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can dig that! If your down with the
Ten-Point-Program, sign up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: There’s a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: You’re Judge right? We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t know you and I got nothing to say to
you.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Yeah you do. It’s up to you either here or
downtown.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: They tried to recruit me. Just like you
figured.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You’re a little old to be a school boy aren’t
you brother. Cool it! You’re probably not the only one they’ve gone
after. Stall a little so they believe you’re for real. Make them trust
you. Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man
jumpy?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Black people getting uppity, feeding their
children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What’s
this world coming to?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Hands up, you ain’t going nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>denzil</strong>: I wasn’t going nowhere in the first place. I
ain’t done shit.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: “Done shit, SIR!!” Nigger don’t move…</p>
<p><strong>denzil</strong>: I ain’t done…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Momma, these here are the Panthers I asked
over from Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>momma dowell</strong>: I thank you all for coming to grieve
with us. The police won’t tell us nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mourner</strong>: They been shooting Black men down around
here like they’re going out of style.</p>
<p><strong>momma dowell</strong>: My boy didn’t do nothing. He didn’t do
nothing. Can’t nobody do something.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: We came to do something.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: …The police report says he was shot three
times but the coroner’s report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was
shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and
Sisters you know why that is? Because Denzil had his hands up!!</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE
WANT?</p>
<p><strong>the crowd</strong>: JUSTICE!</p>
<p><strong>seale</strong>: More programs man!!! In the car.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Afternoon asshole… You shoulda told me
about this. C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: WHAT DO WE WANT?</p>
<p><strong>the panthers</strong>: JUSTICE!!!</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: C’mon let’s…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: No! Just harassment. Can’t let it stop this.
Brother we got momentum!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do we want!!??</p>
<p><strong>the crowd</strong>: JUSTICE!</p>
<p><strong>reverend slocum</strong>: Amen! The Lord God Almighty be our
witness. Let us bow our heads and pray for…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: POWER TO THE PEOPLE!</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: You’re not getting in here with no gun.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: This firearm is being carried in plain view
and is therefore perfectly legal according to California statute…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Over my dead body.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: That’s your call pig.</p>
<p><strong>rev. slocum</strong>: We come for justice, not bloodshed but
don’t be pushing us too far.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bled to death!?!? The Coroner’s report says
he was shot to death. We demand a grand jury investigation in the death
of Denzil Dowell and the pattern of brutality against the Black citizens
of Richmond.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: The Police department has conducted its own
inquest and concluded that no misconduct occurred. As for a “pattern of
brutality…” The charge is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Then what do you call four dead Black men in
six months?!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I call it the police doing there duty under
the law. You got a problem with that… take it to the legislature but get
the hell out of my office.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The pig might just have a point.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: So… we understand each other Judge?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Alright then.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey
Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I’m gonna
come looking for you. And I won’t be as “friendly” as today.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I got you.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: You just remember one thing Judge. You’ve
got a lot at stake. And The Panthers are gonna lose. Question is, are
you gonna lose along with them? Your future? Your mother? Think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: As soon as black people exercise their rights
to bear arms and defend themselves the pigs want to change the law.
We’re not going to make it easy for them to have unarmed targets. Now,
you all have a good time cause this here’s our community and it is a
beautiful thing. Power to the people.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: This brothers is gonna be a colossal event.
We’ll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the
cameras. Will you cool it? What’s up man? What it be Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What it be is, You aren’t coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What? We’re the leadership, you and me. There
ain’t enough of us to…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s just it Huey. The pigs don’t know how
many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2
and 2 together. We’re not even two hundred strong yet… but we got ’em
guessing thousands.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I hear you. Alright. I’ll go, you stay.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Huey… We took a vote. You’re still on
probation. We can’t risk you. Things is starting to get hot. Go mow yo
momma’s lawn like you promised.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Alright, I’ll stay. Judge, I want to…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you
at the rally.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Aw… uh… it’s was just harassment. My driver’s
license expired.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Chickenshits, they’re grabbing at
anything.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What’s the pig’s name?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Brimmer.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god
damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let
me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: And you’re gonna do just that. But I’ll tell
you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah… I guess. Any of other Panthers know
about this?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Man, this shit’s pretty thick.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You got that right. And brother, I got a
feeling it’s going to get a whole lot thicker.</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: Is this a militant action? Are the Panthers
storming the Capitol?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No!!! Definitely not!!! We are here to send a
message. The Black Panther Party for Self Defense calls upon the
American people in general and Black people in particular to take
careful note of the racist California Legislature now considering the
Mulford Act, which is aimed at keeping Black people disarmed and
powerless while racist police agencies throughout the country intensify
the terror, brutality, murder and repression of Black people.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You can’t come in here!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We are here to observe the Assembly. You will
not stop us.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: This door leads to the Assembly floor, it’s
closed to the public. You have to go to the Visitor’s Gallery, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Tell the court Mr. Seale are you proud
to be the co-founder of the Panthers, an anti-white movement.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The Black Panther Party is not anti- white,
you cannot fight racism with racism.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Gentlemen, please approach the bench.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: My clients broke no law. It was an
accident, a wrong turn. Besides, the guns were not illegal.
Dismissal!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: They will be as soon as the Mulford act
passes. Six Months for everyone!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Okay, last offer. Ninety days, no felony
charges, just a disturbing the peace.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Deal!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Not so fast. But only if he and one of
his lieutenants agree to six months.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You got six months to donate to the party,
Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You know it brother.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: …at least that takes Bobby Seale off the
street…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at
all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say
this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them
down. Either from the outside or the inside.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: We’re working on that…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Work harder. And get me some results. Those
Black Bastards could be up to anything.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: C’mon we’re going for a ride…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us about the party you
boys were planning at the capitol?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Shit man. It was… you know spontaneous.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and
you don’t tell me. Remember you’re working for us.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah… whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece
of shit…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: What’s with you?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Get out of the fucking car.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: “Whatever you say, Inspector Brimmer.”
Fucking a right pal. Time you got your wiry head on straight.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: What are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Do you know how easy it would be for you to
just disappear. Shit, you wouldn’t even wash up for weeks. Do you
fucking understand? I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a
bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set ’em
up… armed robbery!!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I can’t… they don’t operate that way…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like
your man says, “By any means necessary.”</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Alright then. Here’s a little help on your
tuition. Get back in the car.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Where the hell’s Judge anyway?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Between school and the Panthers, he’s been
running raw. I never see… Aw shit…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: You want a hand?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: No… go on up. I been kicking his narrow ass
since high school.</p>
<p><strong>white girl</strong>: What you got to sell?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Lady, every Black man you lay eyes on ain’t a
dope dealer.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: “My license was expired” Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: I ain’t gonna tell you no more. No pushing in
the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You’re killing
your own people asshole.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Man, fuck you!!!</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: No Fuck you!!!</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: I ain’t playing Sabu. You keep on like this and
I’m going to bust you up.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Aww man…</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Those Panthers are turning into real
shitheels ain’t they…</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Yeah, they’re motherfuckers, all high and
mighty.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: You shouldn’t take that. If I was you… I’d
stand up for myself, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Tyrone? Shit, where’d you go?.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Look around you, brothers and sisters, we’re
building the numbers. New members coming in almost every day. I’d like
to introduce one of them. He’s is the author of “Soul on Ice,” a
respected journalist and I’m proud to say the newly appointed Minister
of Information for the Black Panther Party. Brothers and sisters,
Eldridge Cleaver.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Brothers and Sisters! You are all well
aware of the chains that we as a people bear. The chains of slavery, of
second class citizenship. But there are other, more invisible chains.
The chains of not speaking your mind. The chains of all the words left
unsaid out of fear of reprisal by The Man. The silencing of our Black
voices. I’m here to tell you that we have a voice. And I’d like to prove
to you. All of you, repeat after me.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Fuck Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: I’m serious. Repeat after me. Fuck Ronald
Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>assembly</strong>: Fuck Ronald Reagan!!!</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Feels good don’t it. Amazing how saying
your mind can free your soul.</p>
<p><strong>assembly</strong>: Fuck Ronald Reagan!!</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Huey man I got to talk with you…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: So talk…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Alone…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Look… can we deal with this tomorrow… I’m
tired…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Listen Judge, Oakland’s Panther International
Headquarters. We shut the Pig’s infiltration down here, they’re gonna
think twice about running their games on other chapters.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Huey, man who’s gonna straighten out the
brothers if they get on my ass?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Like the manual says, “Information is…</p>
<p><strong>huey and judge</strong>: disseminated on a need-to-know
basis.”</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah, and what I need to know, is what exactly
your gonna do about feeding the pigs a bust?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t know man. I don’t know. That reminds
me. Another little donation from the police.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing
The Panthers…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah well, they want a lot for their money.
They want a felony, preferably with “violent intent.” We’ve got to give
them something. They’ll kill me if I don’t. And the Panthers are going
to kill me if I do. I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Me too. That’s why I fight so hard.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Hey, it’s the invisible man. Brother where you
been?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Cy… I ain’t even sure.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: C’mon we’ll walk and talk…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Naw… I gotta…</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: I hear you. I’ll catch you in a bit. Feeling
cooped up in there, you know?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Hey… Cy… what now you a righteous Panther man,
you too uppity to drink with us?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: You know that’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker… I almost forgot how
nasty that shit is.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Well don’t go forgetting your friends.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Ain’t gonna happen, stay cool.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You know it. Stay Black…</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Damn straight.</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: I swear, you gotta be a card-carrying member of
the stupid revolution.</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: Motherfucker… you stay away…</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: Look this is bull…</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: …shit…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: C’mere…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Signed up ’bout a month ago. Says his name’s
Matty. I call him spy!</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Motherfucker gave the pigs the license
numbers of every Panther car.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: This the finger you ratted on us with?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What? You don’t like to see a traitor get
hurt? I wonder why that is?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: If you got something to say, say it.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Anything happens to Huey it ain’t gonna be a
finger. I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It’s Cy… he’s been shot.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Cy… Cy… Oh shit man… who did this to you. Was
it the pigs?</p>
<p><strong>cy</strong>: N… N…… Not… Oh.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Motherfuckers…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Inspector Brimmer</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And
before you bastards kill anyone else, I’ll give you your fucking set up.
That make you happy??!!</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Judge, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m calm. I’m calm. You just shut the fuck
up. And listen…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What’s up with you?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: You got something on your mind…
“brother.”</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah, “brother” My best friend is stone
dead.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Sorry man…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: S’alright. I’m sorry too. Shit, I gotta take
a leak… Pull over at that gas station.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: It’s going down… Right on time.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: If you want gas my nephew…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Where’s your bathroom…</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Out back.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Open the god damn register!!!!</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: How long can a piss take?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Hey… I got one for ya. Two brothers are taking
a leak off the Bay Bridge. First one says, “Damn, this water’s cold.”
Other one just smiles and goes, “Yeah and deep too.”</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Watch the faces Goddamit!! We want them
recognizable…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Easy boy… Or I will blow you right
away…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: We haven’t done nothing! Why don’t you
fascist pigs stop harassing us?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Harassment my ass, pal. You just stuck up
this station. We got a witness…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What kind of bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>rookie cop</strong>: I’ll go get the other one.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: No!!! Get the bastards cuffed, I got
him…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: It’s me Brimmer. Get the fuck out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Today’s arrest exposes the Black Panthers
for what they truly are… common criminals. Yes, we have a group of the
so called revolutionaries in custody right now. Caught red handed
robbing a local business. And as soon as our witness gives us a positive
identification, we’ll file charges of armed robbery with intent to
kill…</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: Sir… was anybody hurt?</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: I have no further comment.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: I want it duly noted, that this operation
was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The
FBI doesn’t have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations,
my friend. As I’ve said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under
control in our city…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: No I’m not. I’d like to say, frankly and
off the record, that I resent the Bureau’s presence here. “Advisory
Basis” or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers
permanently discredited, I’d appreciate it if you’d leave us to take
care of our own. Now I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Brimmer, what are you telling me?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: He’s blind chief. Couldn’t I.D. his
own mother.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: He just stands in for his nephew during
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: This cool the heat off you any?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t know. But I’m sure I’ll find out.
Rose, you did me solid.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Unh… Unh Man… I don’t take no money from
friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Not at all. I’ll catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Judge… I… I shoulda told you this before but…
well… fuck…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It was Sabu killed Cy.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Where is he?.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Ain’t no one seen him.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Didn’t want folks to think I was a snitch. You
know?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yeah man… I know.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Shit… check this out.</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: …something is happening here…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: But you don’t know what it is Mr. Jones. See
Dylan is hip. The part about the geeks getting the worst jobs, that’s
like us, man. Black folks always get given the lowest shit.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Yeah man, but where’s Judge?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You know I think Brother Judge needs our
support right now, not our suspicion This is beautiful man. Folks around
here never read the truth like this before.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: El Rage what’s with all the Zulu shit?</p>
<p><strong>elridge</strong>: We can no longer let the white media
control our image. We gotta let the people know what we are about
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: That’s what our newspaper will do.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: But lots of our people don’t read, man.
They need strong imagery to help them out.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah… then shouldn’t this be all of us
together.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth
a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and
Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally
together. Hell it’d broaden our base of visibility.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah, but aligning with white organizations.
I’m not sure now’s the time.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: The time, my friend, is what Sartre
called, “the moment the match is being put to the fuse.” Question is, is
the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: …no full fledge alliance. But I think we
should do a rally with them. Show that there’s some common ground
between Black and White. You all with that? All right then Eldridge, set
it up.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Hell No! We won’t go! Hell No! We won’t
go!!!</p>
<p><strong>avakian</strong>: Not long ago, we came to these steps to
protest. We were four thousand then. Tonight we are ten thousand.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Thanks a lot Motherfucker, that blind man
was real cute.</p>
<p><strong>avakian</strong>: Ten thousand different voices. All unified,
saying one thing. That you cannot have an imperialistic war abroad and
social peace at home. So with that unity, that purpose in mind… Ladies
and Gentlemen I give you the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther
Party – Huey Newton.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Thank you. The Black Panther Party is proud to
be here tonight. Here in front of this monument to oppression both at
home and abroad. Not far from here, Brother Bobby Seale is locked
down.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: A victim of the tyranny we feel here at
home.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: That same tyranny is at work many miles from
here. In Vietnam. Black men are dying there, white men are dying there.
Yellow men are dying there. We’re told they’re dying in the name of
freedom. Freedom. Well, now if their blood’s keeping us free. How come
so many of us – like Bobby – are in jail. If they’re dying so we can
enjoy our rights, how come the police still kill us in the streets?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: So, when you think about it. The question we
have to ask is… Why should the Black man go fight the Yellow man for the
White man? It’s that simple. The answer’s simple too. We shouldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: The Black Panther Party is opposed to the war
in Vietnam! We know our war is here. Against hard drugs in the
community. Against unemployment. Against a system that beats a Black man
in his home, then sends him to die in a foreign land. That my brothers
and sisters, is our war.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Brimmer! Could you come in here please?</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Sit down, This concerns you too. I don’t
need to say that your department’s handling of the Black Panthers –
particularly Inspector Brimmer’s “undercover operation” has been a
complete travesty.</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Just hold on a god damn minute. I…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: These are memos from the commissioner, the
mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their
subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst
has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations – most
likely sponsored by communists – to undermine the war in Vietnam. By
doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Of course we welcome any cooperation the
your department has to “offer…”</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What’s your name punk?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What?!?!?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Five!!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: And I keep saying “Five” like the fifth
amendment you know? And shit this cop is getting pissed. But there ain’t
much he can do… So… dig this, he gives me a ticket for littering, on
account of the papers he ripped outta my hand.</p>
<p><strong>baby faced cop</strong>: Well, well, well, what do we have
here, the great Huey P. Newton… Get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: California law does not require the driver to
leave a vehicle, unless he is being placed under arrest…</p>
<p><strong>baby faced cop</strong>: Well, then you’re under arrest get
out of the car…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Huey…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I am not resisting arrest. Nor am I armed. Any
use of force on your part is illegal… according to California…</p>
<p><strong>baby faced cop</strong>: You can take that law book and shove
it up your ass nigger…</p>
<p><strong>nervous cop</strong>: Hey… whatcha got…</p>
<p><strong>baby faced cop</strong>: Buddy, we just got ourselves a
promotion.</p>
<p><strong>baby faced cop</strong>: You!!! Get the fuck back in…</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: The pigs are going for Murder one…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Right with Bobby getting out, they try to
put Huey in the gas chamber… Damn.</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: Please Huey stay alive</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: Where’s everybody?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: We had over a hundred people, just on the
“Free Huey” Defense Committee alone until we chose a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: Can he free Huey?</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: If anybody can, he’s the man.</p>
<p><strong>bobby seale</strong>: Brothers the struggle has begun… We
need allies and we need ’em fast. Eldridge?</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: I’m on it…</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Black is beautiful/FREE HUEY!/Set our warrior
free/FREE HUEY!/Black is beautiful/FREE HUEY/Set our warrior free…</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: We say that Huey P. Newton is a prisoner
of war. Many people say that that’s not true. Or that the Party is
exaggerating. I think it’s clear, it’s crystal clear that the United
States has declared war on Black people. She did that when she took the
first black man from Africa.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Now of course, she never came out and
said the words, “I declare war on Black people. She did not do that.
Well now, the United States to this day has not declared war on Vietnam,
but there is Vietnam. They did not declare war on North Korea but they
fought in North Korea. And they did not declare war against the Indians.
They just wiped them out.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: So we must define our position… We are
at war. Huey P. Newton, Minister of Defense, is our leader. He is in
jail. He is a prisoner of war. We must get him by any means necessary.
If we cannot get him, we must, we must retaliate. Period.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Man, we can’t make enough of these things.
We got movie stars calling up, asking how they can help. I tell you
sister it’s nation time…</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Yeah I wish we didn’t need no pins… Wish Huey
was here right now…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Me too…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: You sure about that… brother?</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: Brothers!!! Sisters! Come here. This,
you gotta see…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You all been working so much… you know. Me and
some others thought you might be missing the home cooking…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hutton</strong>: Hey… you got any more of those…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a
bit of a rallying cry for the left…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Rallying cry, it’s an insurrection. Seale,
that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Well… like they say, there’s a Panther born
every minute in the ghetto. Uh… we seem to have “underestimated” the
support of the Black community. It’s their power base…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Well, then we’re going to take that power
away from those bastards.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: You mean…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. And Agent
Rodgers?… This conversation never occurred.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Rodgers… this is no good…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Cut the crap, you’ve been taking the man’s
money for years. Now it’s time you earned it.</p>
<p><strong>trafficante</strong>: Gentlemen!!! Forgive me for keeping
you.</p>
<p><strong>trafficante</strong>: Odd isn’t it Chief Dorsett? No matter
how much we try to deny it, we find ourselves on the same side of the
coin. It’s almost funny…</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: To be quite honest it turns my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: Neither your stomach or your opinion
matters here Dorsett… What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the
Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might
say…The Final Solution.</p>
<p><strong>trafficante</strong>: Well put. As you and Agent Rodgers
know, my organization has moved into narcotics. It was decided that this
product would be confined to the ghettos. However, you and your police
department has made operations in Oakland impossible. I take delivery of
shipments and they sit. I – and my associates – lose money. Vast sums of
money. Now, you have some very large problems with the Black
community.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: More like a revolution. West Oakland’s
turning into hostile territory.</p>
<p><strong>trafficante</strong>: I assure you the pacifying properties
of Heroin are quite remarkable. See, junkie’s politics are different
from yours and mine. For them the only Party’s the next fix.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: Dealing dope… And you want the department
to turn a blind eye while you turn Oakland into a city of zombies.</p>
<p><strong>trafficante</strong>: Not the entire city, just one
troublesome part.</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: And what if it spreads to the rest of the
population?</p>
<p><strong>trafficante</strong>: Relax, Chief. That will never happen. I
gotta little gypsy in me. Soon the moolies gonna be too busy – we’ll
sell ’em a few guns too – blowing each others brains out over the stuff
to be fucking with protests. Now I’ve got the product. What I need is a
center of operation and someone to oversee the movement of the product.
Not one of my people but a native, someone inside the community.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: I don’t think that will be any problem…</p>
<p><strong>dorsett</strong>: You talk as if this thing’s already been
decided.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: It has.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Glad to see you boys eat like that. No wonder
either you’re both looking like scarecrows. Don’t sleep, don’t eat,
ain’t no way to live…</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: It’s good to be skinny, easier to run
from fat cops. Hey what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh no… Dr. King…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh lord, please god no. No.</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: They killed him. He never hurt nobody.
They killed him…</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: That’s right burn the mother down.</p>
<p><strong>slocum</strong>: Hold on there, exactly what are you boys
doing?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Sending a message… They shoot Dr. King…
we burn them…</p>
<p><strong>slocum</strong>: What good’s burning our neighborhood
down.</p>
<p><strong>young man #2</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Brother… you best clean out your head, or we
will do it for you.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Reverend’s right, you burn the neighborhood,
you’re just doing the pig’s work for him. And we sure as hell ain’t
gonna stand for that. Dig?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I dig. But how we gonna let ’em know we
ain’t gonna take this shit.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: You know where Black Panther headquarters is?
You come on down there, speak your mind, listen. Organize.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Later for that… be there.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: No more words!!! No more god damn words!!
No more sitting, no more praying for the pig to stop killing us. Later
for lying down. Later for waiting to get shot like dogs. Nonviolence has
died in Memphis, died with Dr. King. We must retaliate. We’ve got the
fucking guns, it’s time to use them.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Off the pig man. Off the god damn
pig.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Brother Eldridge… I hear you. But I disagree.
And we both know Huey disagrees too. Yeah, we got the guns, but the Pigs
got more. The Pig has got the National Guard. I’m not afraid to fight.
But we aren’t stupid either. We got to be smart, not angry.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Later for that…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: No man… later for you! What? We gonna forget
Huey and his trial? Start killing pigs, start the revolution now. With
our leader in jail? We do that and Huey’s a dead man. We’re all dead. No
man, we stay cool.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: What? You giving me orders now?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Just telling you what it is.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Fuck that. It’s time to intensify the
struggle. That is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You got to sit on Eldridge…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah, I do, but he’s gotta cool it…</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: Papa E, we got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Take off your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Take ’em off. Pigs ain’t gonna shoot an
unarmed, naked man. Where they gonna say you hid a gun.</p>
<p><strong>little bobby</strong>: No man I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Later for that. Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>cop#1</strong>: Go on, get in that car fuckers, and don’t try
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: I am not resisting arrest!!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He was going for this…</p>
<p><strong>eldridge</strong>: Motherfuckers…</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Little Bobby… Just a kid…</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: They’re hurting us, baby. Huey locked up.
Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy
dead. Little Bobby… I don’t recognize half the faces at meetings.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: ’Cept him…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look… I gotta get on a plane tonight. Huey’s
trial’s starting. I need you to make sure there’s a strong Panther
Presence there.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What about Cleaver? You got him out on bail,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah… but well, things are too hot. Eldridge
and Kathleen…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: …they’re gonna disappear…</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: So you enjoy your little “vacation?”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I tell you, Vegas don’t have much flavor. But
it was alright. Good to get back to the neighborhood though.</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: That’s what we wanted to talk to you about.
We have a proposition for you. One that will make you the most powerful
man in West Oakland…</p>
<p><strong>sabu</strong>: I’m all ears…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Hey… what the hell you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Brimmer what’s with you man?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Twenty years asshole. Twenty years on the
force. I’ve seen some fucked up stuff. Done some fucked up stuff… But
nothing like this…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of
here!!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting
arrest?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: I ain’t gonna shoot you Judge. Look… it’s
over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it’s gone…
it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Brimmer you’re fucked up…</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Yeah… I’m fucked up. You’re fucked up.
Government’s fucked up. Whole country’s fucked up. You got no idea
what’s going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We’re just little
tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole’s desk. The
Panthers… fuck you’re history… they killed you and you don’t even know
it.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Who’s they?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: Drugs Judge, they’re gonna flood West
Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar
whore. And while the community’s shuffling for a fix, they’re gonna
snuff every Panther they can find.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Who? I mean besides the FBI?</p>
<p><strong>brimmer</strong>: I don’t know. Except, it’s one of you.
Maybe not a Panther, but it’s someone from the neighborhood. Judge.
Look, just go. Get away. It’s over. You lost. We all lost.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Fuck that. Ain’t nothing over.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Judge…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Rose?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah… Look man, what I gotta say. It’s just
you, me and the rats, right? Alright… well… Sabu’s back.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Motherfuck… well then I got something to
do.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No… wait, there’s something else, something
weird. I hear he’s set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He’s
talking big and living bigger.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: God damn it’s him. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu’s got juice
now.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You don’t even know it man, but you’re a god
damn hero.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: No more brothers in jail Off the Pig! The
pigs are gonna catch hell Off the Pig! Revolution has come Off the Pig!
Time to pick up the gun Off the Pig!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Now you say that it was Huey Newton that
opened fire without any provocation What makes you so sure? It was a
dark night, there was a lot of confusion.</p>
<p><strong>wounded cop</strong>: Well, sir I was there.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: That’s right you were. He was there. He
saw everything. And he is not on trial. He does not need to lie to save
his life. Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>garry</strong>: Thank you. If it would please the court, I
would like to introduce testimony of a new witness. One who is not on
trial for his life and… one who was there also. I call Gene McKinney to
the stand.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Objection, who is this man?</p>
<p><strong>garry</strong>: This is an eyewitness to the shooting. The
passenger in Huey Newton’s car.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Overruled Mr. Garry you may examine your
witness.</p>
<p><strong>garry</strong>: Mr. McKinney, were you a passenger in the car
on the night of October 28, 1967.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes sir I was.</p>
<p><strong>garry</strong>: And did you witness the shoot-out?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes sir, I did.</p>
<p><strong>garry</strong>: From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the
shooting?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No sir he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>garry</strong>: Huh, well then… did someone else start
shooting?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I refuse to answer the question on the grounds
it might incriminate me.</p>
<p><strong>garry</strong>: Did you shoot the officers in question?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Again I’ll take the fifth amendment on that
question.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: That was Garry. He says they’re gonna come
back with manslaughter.</p>
<p><strong>young panther</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: It means youngblood, Huey’s out in less than
two years. He ain’t gonna get the chair. He might not be free yet, but

<p><strong>angry cop</strong>: Can’t believe that rat bastard ain’t
going to the chair. That Newton turd should be taken out and shot.</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: How about a little target practice?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey
gets out, when Oakland’s just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you
blew away the only chance we all got. I’m sure he’ll be real happy about
that.</p>
