<h1 id="dark-angel">dark-angel</h1>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The escape was not my idea. I mean, escape to
what? We didn’t know there was anything else.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was Zack who said we had to leave. So I
guessed he saved my life… And I never even got the chance to thank
him.</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: This is Lydecker. I want you to capture if
you can. But if any of them make it to the perimeter, you are to
terminate. Is that understood?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Confirming, Sir, you’re giving an order
ten-oh-six.</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: I’ll take responsibility. If they reach
the outer fence…shoot to kill.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go on… GO!</p>
<p><strong>jondy</strong>: No. We stick together.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go, Jondy. I’ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>jondy</strong>: Max…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: We’ve got seven so far…three wounded,
two killed. And my men are taking a helluva beating.</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: Just get them, Lieutenant. It’s your ass
if one of them makes it to the outside.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Realistically, Sir, it’s ten degrees out
here. How far can these kids get?</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: Find them.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sometimes it seems like it happened to someone
else. Like maybe it was a story I heard… The hardest part is not
knowing…if any of them made it. If I knew for sure I was the only one
left, it would be worse. At least now I can make up lives for them… Like
maybe Jondy’s a fashion photographer…or an architect. The truth is
they’d just be like me… living on the run, always looking over your
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hope is for losers. It’s a con job people trip
behind until they finally get a grip on the cold hard truth… But still
I…hope they’re out there, somewhere…some of them. And that they’re
okay.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: It sucks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What sucks?</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: I come home, it’s three a.m., you’re still
out. I feel like I got hit by a cement truck and you been up for an hour
bouncing around. That by definition sucks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I made you coffee. That oughta help you cope
with the injustice of the world a little.</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: Thanks, it’s starting to kick in. I feel
almost human.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Knock, knock.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hi guys. Let’s roll, hotshot.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Gotta take a personal day. Whatever it is I
got, I’m bitin’ it bad.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s payday, need me to pick up your check?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: You’re the best, Maxie.</p>
<p><strong>jacinda</strong>: Come on, little bit, you’re gonna be late
for school. Three more bites.</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: Two more.</p>
<p><strong>jacinda</strong>: But big ones. Everything’s a
negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jam Pony Messenger.</p>
<p><strong>young soldier</strong>: Have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They used to say one nuclear bomb can ruin your
whole day. It was sort of a joke until the June morning those terrorist
bozos whacked us with an electromagnetic pulse from eighty miles up… You
always hear people yappin’ on how it was all different before the
pulse…land of milk and honey, blah blah blah, with plenty of food and
jobs and things actually worked. I was too young to remember
so…whatever.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thing I don’t get is why they call it a
depression. I mean, everyone’s broke but they aren’t really all that
depressed… Life goes on.</p>
<p><strong>herbal</strong>: Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What’s a
bruddah s’posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: So you just decided to return it to the
sender. Or, in this case, the sender’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>herbal</strong>: Like de prophets say, “Only the unrighteous
husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman.”</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Which is none of your business…or mine.</p>
<p><strong>herbal</strong>: It concerns only Jah. But, in this case, I
was the instrument of the Most High.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Yeah, well around here, I’m the Most High…
From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: This is a hot run. Beat it. You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I was on call.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: I want you on call here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s the difference if I’m on call here or
deployed in the field.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: More like deployed in bed asleep.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t sleep… Theo asked me to pick up his
check.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: And Theo can’t pick up his own check
because?…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: For a change.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How ’bout you don’t break my sneakers on this.
The guy is seriously not well.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: You tell Theo he’s not in tomorrow he can
start looking for another job.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know how to break this to you, Normal,
we’re all looking for another job.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Morning, Sunshine…</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing
my bike. Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of
spokes. So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: At least he didn’t swing with your ride.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: No, but I broke a nail giving him a
cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Now, why can’t I find a girlfriend
like that? Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here
to there–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Straight.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Shame, wastin’ a girl like that on a
guy, but what’re you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Homemade. Natalie baked them for our
anniversary. The big one-oh.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The big one-oh?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: We went on our first date ten months ago
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>eyes only</strong>: Do not attempt to adjust your set. This
is a Video Free America bulletin. The cable hack will last exactly sixty
seconds. It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped, and it is the only
free voice left in this city…</p>
<p><strong>sketchy eyes only)</strong>: Is this guy for real? There are
certain men who move through the world with MAX impunity. Their actions,
no matter how vile, are immune Who knows… from consequence. Edgar
Sonrisa is such a man. You’ve seen him smiling at political DRUID
fund-raisers, sitting at the He ever been wrong Mayor’s table drinking
about anything? champagne. He owns shopping centers, a trucking company
and the largest medical MAX supply company in San You ask me, he’s on
the Francisco. He also runs drugs hustle same as everyone and guns up
and down the west else. coast. He’s very publicly, very obviously dirty.
But he has never been arrested… Someone shushes her. never indicted.
Journalists who have attempted to expose him have been gunned down in
DRUID the street. Their blood is Doesn’t mean he’s not the ink of our
modern news. telling the truth. Those who’ve opposed him have vanished…
All of that is about to change…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Doesn’t mean he is.</p>
<p><strong>herbal</strong>: Just hope Jah’s looking out for his ass
’cause he’s messing with the brimstone, bruddah.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Major negativity heading this-a-way.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Someone oughta drop a little science on
these straight edge idiots.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not my problem…or yours.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Catch you back at the wall.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hit you back later.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Never seen her miss.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Delivery…1906.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No bikes in the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This was s’posed to be the financial district,
back before the banks closed. America really thought they had it dialed
in– money hangin’ out the ass. But it was all just a bunch of ones and
zeros in a computer someplace. So when that bomb went KA-BLOOEY and the
electromagnetic pulse turned all the ones and zeros into plain ol’
zeros, everyone’s like “no way.” Now America’s just another broke
ex-super power looking for a handout and wondering why.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ’s up.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Fog City’s finest.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Quitting time. Grab a cold one?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Right, the big one-oh.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: But I’ll take a rain check…</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Can I talk to Natalie? You’re not going to
believe this. I’m walkin’ out the door and my idiot boss sticks me with
a delivery way the hell out in the East Bay somewhere. So I’m not gonna
be able to make dinner… I know it’s not fair… I begged, I pleaded, I
pissed, I moaned, but I gotta do what I gotta do… We’ll do something
special, I promise… I love you too. Mousetrap. Kisses.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Sorry I’m late but–</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: You in?</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: What’s the action?</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Max can repeat a fourteen-digit
phone number by listening to the beep tones.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: On speed dial. Buy-in’s ten.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Last chance… Okay. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Seven-Nine-Six-Five-Seven-Three-Eight-One-
Four-Two-Four-Six-Nine-Five.</p>
<p><strong>druid</strong>: How’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I’ll have a beer…since you’re
buying.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How’re ya doin’, Max.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: You mean until you showed up?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’re not still pissed?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why would I be pissed?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It was a complicated situation which could
have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: ’Cause you went out the back door
and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Justine was not an unwilling
participant.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Do you know why I went after Justine?</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: She was there…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Trying to have a relationship with you, Max,
is like standing in a fog bank. You know you’re in the middle of
something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: And when the fog lifted, there’s
Darren with his head under Justine’s skirt.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Could you give us a moment.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I was crazy about you…am crazy about you.
But you keep everyone at arm’s length like there’s some great big dark
something going on that– I don’t know… It’s just that the more I tried
to get close to you, the more you pulled away.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m really glad we’re having this conversation.
You’re right. I was angry at you. But talking about it– The scales have
fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault. Can you ever
forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I see the perimeter defense system is still
fully intact… At least I tried.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Craps all over everything and
everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What guys do. ’Nother order.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: You’re way more philosophical than I
could ever be.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I just don’t go in with any expectations.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You guys seen Sketchy?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thought he was having dinner with you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: He had to bail at the last minute on
accounta some emergency run. Thought maybe he stopped by here on the way
home.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Haven’t seen him. But if we do–</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Hope he’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: He probably just got stuck in
traffic or something.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s odd…</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell me the truth. Am I a female fog bank?</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: You’re not seriously buying into
Darren’s nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: He was just trying to blame you
’cause he’s a slut.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Hell yeah. There’s not the slightest
grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying. You are a totally
down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A little what?</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: You know what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn’t be
asking.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: How long you and me known each
other?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A long time.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Long enough for you to pretty much
read me like a book, right?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Because you’re probably my closest friend in
the whole world.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: And back at ya. Only there’s a part
of you that’s… I don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A fog bank.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: More like a mystery… Which isn’t
bad. It’s just kinduv…mysterious…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: I asked you to keep that thing
outside.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: You drive away business roarin’ in like
that.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere
you got goin’ on here.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My name’s not kid. It’s client. As in the
person who pays for your opulent lifestyle. Now, you got something for
me or not?</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Right here someplace.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: I got a hit on the car. An oh-five Tahoe,
blue, with Wyoming tags… AGT349… It wasn’t easy ’cause you were off in
one of the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sorry, I was seven at the time.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who’s this guy? This isn’t who we’re looking
for…her name was Hannah.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: He got the car in a trade for his old
pick-up and some food…no bill of sale or nothing. It was right after the
pulse so all the DMV records were wiped. So we don’t get anything on the
seller. Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the
phone… Say thank you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: He says he got it from a woman. Doesn’t
remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a
glove.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Get in! Hurry, come on!</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Guy says he made the trade in Gillette,
Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Then what? That’s it. That’s all I
got.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nothing on Hannah?</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: A nuclear airburst wipes out every record
of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to
find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don’t
even know… Maybe if you could give me something more on her…anything you
can remember, some detail…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She was a nurse. She must’ve lived near there,
somewhere, near the… …the clinic. There must be some registry of nurses
or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Only a last name would be nice. Or the
nearest town to this…clinic.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What about the other kids? You get anything on
them?</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: They don’t exactly have a search engine
for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is
something I’m not even going to ask about–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You were gonna run through the law enforcement
databases for a match on identifying marks.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Nothing so far from arrests, hospital
admissions or coroners. This kind of search…it’s heavy spadework. I’m
gonna need–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: More money… Like I’m shocked to hear you say
that.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Eyes Only cannot be bought or threatened. And
through the Eyes Only informant net, a truth-speaker has come
forward.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The testimony of one fearless witness will
soon lead to an indictment of Edgar Sonrisa for multiple counts of
murder.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The drug cortodiazapine is expensive, in
short supply and much sought after as a cancer treatment. It is shipped
to veterans’ clinics to treat the Balkan War Syndrome, a disease which
is otherwise fatal.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sonrisa has been replacing the federal drug
shipments with sugar pills, selling the real cortodiazapine on the
Canadian black market for two thousand dollars a bottle. What fuels the
demand? The belief that cortodiazapine could slow the effects of aging
when taken in large doses.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: There is no hard scientific evidence to
support these claims. But that doesn’t stop Edgar Sonrisa from peddling
this drug to the few wealthy, privileged foreigners who can afford to
pay any price for vanity’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Edgar Sonrisa gets richer while combat vets
exposed to the genetically- engineered bio-war agents go untreated. All
over this city, they are repaid for defending this country by being
allowed to waste away and die…a slow, agonizing death…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Oh my God! In here! IN HERE!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: SHHH! Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Lauren…are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: We’re alright.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If he’s the side of beef with the walkie-
talkie, he’s okay but he’ll be awhile.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re a thief?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Girl’s gotta make a living.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: First time I ever heard that.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I was expecting someone else.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Guess it wasn’t the pizza delivery guy.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re lucky. I almost pulled the
trigger.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry if I caught you at a bad time.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We’re just a little tense right now… It’s
okay.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You have good taste. French, 1920’s,
attributed to Chitarus.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Whoever that is.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: So, what, you liked it because it was
shiny?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, because it’s the Egyptian goddess Bast.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Who is…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye
of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives
forever… I could keep going.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Stay back, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, I’d love to hang and discuss art but I
gotta get going.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aaaah! Aaaah! Easy, my wrist is gonna
snap!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That could happen. By the way, I love your
show.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Nooo! Waaaiiit!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Kendra…this is a motorcycle. It’s sole reason
for being is to go fast. Very fast. It was not put on this earth for you
to use as a clothesline. I love you as a roommate and a friend, but,
make no mistake, I love my motorcycle more. DON’T-TOUCH-THE-BIKE,
OKAY?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I live here… Guess I don’t have to ask what
you’re doing here.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’re roommates?</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: Some of us are trying to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You didn’t tell me you lived with her.</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: You know each other?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s a mistake I made about six months before
you did. But don’t feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with
Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke–</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: Yech…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Nothing happened between me and Tia.</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: Leave. Now.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Can I say something in my defense?</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Everybody down.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Police drone.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s a sweep. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What? Where’re we going?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Lemme put some clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No time.</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: Move it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Out there.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and
Kendra handle the cops.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: But I’m afraid of–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t look down.</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: What a creep.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And for all his cattin’ around, not much of a
stick man either.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: All unauthorized individuals vacate the
premises or face immediate arrest.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Ladies…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Morning, Walter. What’s the good word?</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Just doing my part to keep the homeless
problem from getting out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Read my mind… You haven’t seen anyone
trespassing around here?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Gosh, no.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Seventh floor is vacant and secure. Have a
nice day.</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: What’s with you? Every week this scumbag
puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon
like he’s family.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just thought maybe he’d like a little coffee
with his saliva.</p>
<p><strong>kendra</strong>: You didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Every week.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Max? Kendra?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: C’mon guys…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Before I forget, Theo’s check. I got in late
last night and didn’t want to bother you.</p>
<p><strong>jacinda</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’s he feeling?</p>
<p><strong>jacinda</strong>: Took him to the hospital again. They gave
him some medicine but he says it’s not helping.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know how it is. You or me get sick, life
goes on. A guy get the sniffles and the world’s coming to an end.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: That you, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Playing hooky again?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Feel like the dog’s dinner.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Probably a touch of what’s going around.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: I know what I got, Max. They put me back on
that drug they’re giving the other vets. Only the guy does those cable
hacks says the stuff’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t believe everything you hear on TV.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: What if he’s on the level?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Here’s the dealio on Eyes Only. He’s probably
some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored
stupid. So he gets off on scarin’ the poop outta folks like you– I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Tell everybody hey.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You can tell ’em yourself tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like I said, guys are the weaker sex.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Glad you’re getting your money’s worth outta
that tape. Had to grease the guard a hundred for it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You tryin’ to I.D. the perp, or a new
girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: If I’d just gotten my ass kicked by a size
five, I might be inclined to mind my own business.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like that?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Not bad for a beginner.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, Sketchy–</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: We gotta talk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: It’s kinda important.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You blew off your girlfriend last night, even
though it was the big one-oh. I’d be pissed off too if I was her.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Not half as pissed as she’s gonna be when
she finds out why I blew her off… I need your help, Max.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: See, I’ve more or less been seeing this
other person.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t see how you cheating on Natalie
involves me.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: I know what you’re thinking. But the truth
is, this other person is not someone I’m in love with. As a matter of
fact, after what she just did, she’s not even someone I like much. So in
a technical sense, I’m not sure you could call me and her
cheating…officially.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do guys actually believe their lame, self-
serving excuses?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Max–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Or do you think we’re just so grateful to have
one of you idiots we’ll look the other way, which is arrogant and
condescending.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Lame, self-serving, arrogant…guilty as
charged.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You left out condescending.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: But there’s another side–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Here it comes. The part where the guy turns
everything around.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: I’m the victim here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Hear me out. This person I’ve been seeing
is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And you were a sympathetic ear.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then a sympathetic mouth, then a
sympathetic–</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: She had me followed the other day and found
out about Natalie. Now, this person’s demanding I blow her off or she’ll
do it for me by telling Nat about us.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Does this person have a name?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Lydia.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a
victim in what way?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: I’m a toy to her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A toy?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: She’s as much as said so. But she doesn’t
want to share her toy with anyone else… It’s just an ego thing with
her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fight fire with fire. Threaten to go to her
husband.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Who either doesn’t care, or could have me
killed. Either way, Natalie’s still gonna find out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happens if you level with her?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Even if she doesn’t dump me, which is
unlikely, she’d never be able to trust me again.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And why should she?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Look Max, I made a terrible mistake. One
I’ll never, ever make again. Natalie and I are soulmates. I know that
now. She’s the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I guess
it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Pick-up at four-eleven Montgomery going to
Pacific Heights.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m looking for a lady who works here.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Ladies would be elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Know where I can find her?</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: You don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: But she does work here?</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: She may be easy on the eyes but she’s
trouble, trust me. Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I need to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How ’bout her name and address?</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Max something. I got no clue where she
stays.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Any idea when she’ll be back?</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: She hangs out after work at a place called
Zeitgeist.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: You’re actually gonna bail Sketchy
out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, ’cause maybe he’s learned his lesson.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And because he’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Friends don’t help other friends
cheat.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And because I actually kinda feel sorry for
guys sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’re prisoners to their genes.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: So are dogs.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They don’t have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Only one I can think of.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Besides, think of the drama I’m sparing
Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: I say hang the bastard out to dry,
let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she’ll step to the
all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But, of course, there’s nothing self- serving
in that scenario.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So this guy walks into a bar and says…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We didn’t get a chance to finish our
conversation the other night.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Logan Cale.</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sorry about your window.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Can we go somewhere and talk?</p>
<p><strong>original cindy</strong>: Woop, Xena’s on.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Lemme get my coat.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The one you’re wearing?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Wasn’t that hard.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Am I s’posed to be flattered by all the
attention?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Now you know who I am, where I live. I
figured I better find out who I’m dealing with in case you were looking
to hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So now you tracked me down. What d’ya
think?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Too early to tell.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a
guy on everybody’s hit list?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Lauren’s not my wife.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: One of my sources. Her husband was murdered
by Edgar Sonrisa.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s your shot in all this? Being a famous,
anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can’t be much of a
payday.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Fortunately, my needs are met in that
department.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So, what, you just like the sound of your own
voice?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Look around at all this… Built by people who
got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life. Then
the bomb happened and everyone got scared. They blinked and before they
knew it they’d given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy
to take it off their hands. Overnight the government, the police,
everything intended to protect the people had been turned against
them.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You miss the good ol’ days. Even though there
were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn’t have to.
And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses
to match the cat. Those good ol’ days?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: People had a choice, even if they took it for
granted. And now they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So what are you gonna do about it?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Something.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Personally, I’m more interested in going fast
on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals.
Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can’t do anything
about.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You accept the way things are, you’re an
active participant in making it worse.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is the social studies class over for today?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That was a pretty extraordinary display of
athleticism the other night. In fact, a little too extraordinary. You
wanna tell me how–</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: So you’re straight on how this is gonna go
down.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You set up on Lydia. When she’s on her way over
to the apartment you give me the heads up. I answer the door and pretend
to be Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: She tells you how I’ve been–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: –a philandering pig.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: But you explain that you’re a compassionate
and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive
me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck
who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what
would really happen.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: I just don’t want Natalie to ever find out.
She deserves better.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’d you get her out of town?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Convinced her she needed to visit her mom
in San Mateo.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And we’re sure Lydia’s gonna make her move?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: She came by the apartment once already.
Fortunately, I’d disconnected the doorbell as a precaution… Lydia’s not
gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll give it my best shot.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like
you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You don’t.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Fourteen-thirteen Market. Get a signature,
then take it to this address… By the way, that guy who was in here
sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell him I took the day off ’cause I wasn’t
feeling so hot.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: What about this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m taking the rest of the day off ’cause I’m
not feeling so hot.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: A friend of your fiance’s.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: To set the record straight about where he was
the other night when he said he was working late.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: My name’s Lydia. And it seems you and I have
a lot in common.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You said you knew where my fiance was the other
night.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: With me, where he’s been after work, three,
sometimes four nights a week for the last two months… We have what you
might call an intimate relationship.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How do I know you’re telling the truth?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately? That’s
so you won’t see the fingernail marks on his back. Bet you didn’t know
your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting. He didn’t either…at
first.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, I don’t know what you want–</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I thought it was important for you to know
the facts.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And so should you. Sketchy told me I could
expect a visit from you. I know all about how you threatened him. That
if he didn’t break it off with me, you’d save him the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, it’s over between you and him. We’re
getting married next month.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: How sweet. Standing by your man, even after
what he did. You’re a very understanding person.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Big part of loving someone’s being able to
forgive them.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You’re also a fool.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think you should go now.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Not before we get something straight you
prissy little bitch. I decide when I’m done with your boyfriend. Not
him, and certainly not you. Unless maybe you want to find out just how
sharp these nails really are.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is not a place you wanna go.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Let go of my hand.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m working very hard to respect my elders here
but don’t push your luck.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Help… Lemme go… No, don’t let me go…
Help…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Now, here’s how it’s gonna be, Lydia. You’re
gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you’re gonna go home
and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people
feel as miserable as you do, understand?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Say the words, “I understand.”</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And if I ever catch you coming near my man
again…</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: You rock, Max. You… Rock…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Easy Sketchy.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: No, I’m serious. That psycho got exactly
what she deserved… Yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Lydia may not have been one of humanity’s finer
specimens but–</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: She’s toxic…monster in bed, but toxic.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You would be making a mistake to come away from
this thinking she’s the villain in the piece… You are.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: She was the one–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: None of this would’ve happened if you had
exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: True, but–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You were trying to have it both ways and you
were being completely selfish. And if I ever find out you’re going out
the back door on Natalie again, you’re the one who’s gonna be hanging by
your ankles three stories up. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Okay, okay, okay–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Say the words, “I understand.”</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Yeah… Who’s this? …Oh, hey Phyllis,
didn’t recognize your voice… What’s up? …The usual, doing some work for
a client. Thinks one of his bartender’s got his hand in the till. Kid
works three days a week for tips, just dropped forty large on a new
ride… Tonight? …I really can’t… Of course I want to see you but–</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: What are you wearing? …The red one? …See
you in a few.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: We’re closed. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Damnit…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Kendra… Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up
around dinner time?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I won’t be staying.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m not a half bad cook.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like following me around and pestering the
people I work with wasn’t bad enough, but breaking into my
apartment–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It was open.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You got a lotta nerve.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Me? You’re the one who tried to rip off this
piece.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Completely different situation. I steal things
in order to sell them. For money. It’s called commerce. But some
stranger sneaking into a girl’s bedroom is…bent.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Bent?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bent.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You make it sound I pawed through your
priceless collection of underwear.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How do I know you didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: So saw my hands off, I left you a
present.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Am I s’posed to be grateful?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That would be appropriate, yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’m I s’posed to ever sleep there again
knowing some pervo’s probably touched everything I own?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re that nervous, you’re welcome to stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Whoa there, Tex! We’ve been through all
this.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s alright, Peter, we’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We are not fine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is a tactical exposure which I go on
record as not liking.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Noted… Peter, do me a favor and look in on
Lauren and Sophy.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable
or creeped you out–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes on all counts.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m sorry. It wasn’t my intention. But I had
to see you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’d think a guy who’s taken on the job of
saving the world would have a few more important things to do than
traipse around after some girl.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I haven’t been able to get you off my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You need to get out more.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: C’mere, I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen
hundreds… I could probably fence this for three or four grand.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No, I meant this.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Probably the most singularly beautiful face
I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits,
over-the-top flattery… You always come on this strong?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Only when I meet someone I have to know
everything about.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: And now I think I know pretty much
everything.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Suppose I could help you locate the other
ones.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The other ones?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The other one like you…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You lost me.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: C’mon, Max. First I watch you dive headfirst
out the window fifteen stories up like you’re Rocky the flying squirrel.
Then, I found this in your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: L-Triptophane…a neurotransmitter sometimes
used in homeopathy to control seizures. Then the lightbulb went off.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You did go through my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I got an anonymous report a couple years ago
from a guy who says he was a lab tech at a covert genetics lab in the
Wyoming mountains…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing
here but I’m out because you are a whack-job.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He was working on something called Project
Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human…a
warrior…an advanced infantry soldier.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not that I don’t enjoy a good urban legend now
and then but what does any of this have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The bar code on your neck, Max. I know who
you are and I know who you’re running from.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: There were a couple of dozen of these
transgenic kids. And in oh-nine, a few months before the pulse, six of
them escaped.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Six?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re one of those kids, Max.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Goodnight Bears. Goodnight chairs. Goodnight
kittens. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks. And goodnight socks.
Goodnight little house. And goodnight–</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: I don’t want to move away.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it
will be– new house, new school, new friends–</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: But why can’t we stay here?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Because we can’t. There’s nothing here for
us anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: Are we in some kind of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: Then how come last night I heard you talking
to Logan and you were crying?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: What makes you cry?</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: If I’m sad, or tired, or sometimes when I’m
angry or when somebody’s being mean to me.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.
But things will be better when we move to a new place.</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: Then I’m gonna do what you do to make me feel
better when I’m sad.</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: I’m going to read you a story… And goodnight
mouse. Goodnight camel. And goodnight brush. Goodnight nobody. And
goodnight mush–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We got separated right away. I never knew how
many made it.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How well do you remember the lab?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I remember fine. I just didn’t understand what
was going on. They never told us anything except what to do. It took me
a long time afterwards to figure things out.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How much do you know?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know they made me. Even got the label on my
neck to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The technical term for you is “chimera”…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah…a made-up creature. Like in mythology…with
the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: A girl.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Your basic hodge-podge.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hardly…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or
relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different
people.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the
best.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You said you could help.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I need to find this technician, or anyone
else who knows about Project Manticore. They would’ve used surrogate
mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work… If I can track down one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s in it for you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Your help.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I already don’t like the sound of this.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The woman you met, Lauren. She supervised
workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it
with powdered sugar. The real drug was shipped out of the country. The
placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans’
clinics in the area.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s low, but this effects me how
exactly?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: She’s prepared to testify that she was
instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa’s managers. You know who
Sonrisa is?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I catch your hacks. He’s Satan’s lap dog,
or something.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: So, you know the lengths he’ll go to keep her
from going public… I’m turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement
tomorrow. They’ll put her in witness protection, but if you’re with her
the risk of her safety goes way down.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I didn’t make it this far by attracting a lot
of attention.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: She’s put her life on the line, and her faith
in me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They want me…bad. Or at least they don’t want
me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever. Best case, I wind up back in
that facility. More likely, it’s a long drive out in the country, if you
know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’ve lost track of me and I plan to keep it
that way.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re a soldier, Max. That’s what you were
put here for. But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves
up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s deep. But before you lecture me about
the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one…ta ta.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Where’d you clip this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I didn’t. It was a present from a guy.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Must think you’re pretty special laying this
on you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thought so. Turned out he wanted me for
something else though.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Same old story. Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thought I’d let you have first crack…
Later.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: What’re you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A grand.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who’s
got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the
times.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I ain’t mad at you…</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I’ll give you seventy-five bucks for it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I shouldn’t do this. But I got a client
lookin’ to score some fire power. Maybe you’ll keep your eyes open for
me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t get involved with guns.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I’ll make it worth your while.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s a rule.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re light a deuce.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: So Max, what do you do with all your
money?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I got overhead…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Walked in on some hump ransacking the
place. Disgruntled former client, or someone I’m looking into trying to
see what I got. Or it coulda been your garden variety junkie boost. Who
knows?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: As long as you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: I’ll live… Regarding your case…I’m afraid
I’ve come up with some bad news on your fiance. Lemme get the file.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: If you need to freshen up, bathroom’s
over there.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: I don’t know what your story is and I
don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Here’s your money.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Whoever tossed this place wants you. And
I’m looking to stay outta the line of fire.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’s this about me?</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: They lifted my wallet to make it look
like a robbery. But there’s a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the
phone and a mike in the light fixture.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like you said, maybe somebody’s tracking one of
your investigations.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Hardware’s too sophisticated. It’s gotta
be the government. And why do I think they’re looking for you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: I’m you, I take that money and get outta
town while you can.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Your fiance has four previous wives. His
M.O. is to clean ’em out and take off. Which is what you oughta do.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bastard…</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: I’m sorry I couldn’t come up with
something more positive.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You and me both.</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: Blam-Blam-Blam, you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Turn that off, Omar, before you get the cops on
us.</p>
<p><strong>jacinda</strong>: Come on, Omar, it’s time to go to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jacinda</strong>: I took Theo to the hospital tonight… He
couldn’t walk so I borrowed some money and we took a cab but…</p>
<p><strong>jacinda</strong>: …he didn’t make it… He’s dead. Oh my God…
Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: F.Y.I… Normal’s a grumpy muffin this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Nice of you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight… And
you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that
he cares but the wife and kid might.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Theo’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Two men are dead, and another
critically wounded after a shoot-out near the Superior Court Building
today. A police air-remote unit captured this dramatic footage at 9:47
this morning, after automatically homing on the sound of gunfire.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: That was extreme! Did you see that one
guy–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Shut-up…</p>
<p><strong>sandoval</strong>: We been set up on Vogelsang thirty-six
hours and so far, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dochnovich</strong>: A few customer complaints– the dryer ate
my money, rinse cycle’s not long enough, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>sandoval</strong>: And three or four P.I. clients. Strictly
run of the mill. I don’t think this guy can help us.</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: Twenty-three computer hits from one
detective. He browses Wyoming DMV records from ten years ago, employment
files on health care personnel working in the Gillette area around the
same time. Then he searches prison records for unidentified males and
females approximately eighteen to twenty years old. And you want me to
believe it’s happenstance?</p>
<p><strong>dochnovich</strong>: Since the pulse there’ve been how many
thousand missing person searches. This is probably one of them.</p>
<p><strong>sandoval</strong>: And nothing in those searches or our
surveillance connects him with Manticore.</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: No. He’s trying to track down these kids…
And we’re not going to do anything to get in his way.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sure looks like you pissed off the wrong
folks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nurses beat me to it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Coulda told ya. You take a header into the deep
end when the pool’s empty, you’re gonna go splat. Law of gravity. And
even Jesus Christ himself had to obey the law of gravity. For awhile
anyway. Well, better you than me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The one I feel sorry for is that poor woman
with the kid. She shoulda told ya to stick it like I did. But she bought
your crap about “doin’ what’s right”… dumb bitch.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And just so you know, I don’t feel the
slightest guilt about not watchin’ her back. That’s on you, hotshot. One
hundred percent.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I probably oughta let ’em just finish the job.
Least then you won’t get more innocent people whacked on accounta your
ambition… On the other hand–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You did lay that statue on me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Which I was able to fence for a coupla
bucks–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Been wantin’ to buy myself a new
motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thinking about stepping up to a Harley… You
take care.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Makes me wanna take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bingo…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Damn… Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: They took my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: I couldn’t get to her. It all happened so
fast. Logan had her, and I saw him fall…then Peter told me to run. And
then he…and I remember so clearly, thinking it’s me they want. If I run,
maybe they’ll come after me. Maybe they won’t think about her… So I
ran…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They won’t hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Your daughter’s the only leverage they have to
keep you quiet.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Can you help me get her back?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, I’d really like to…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …So I will.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The shooter who tried to finish off Logan…
Works for Sonrisa, surprise, surprise. Bruno Anselmo. Born 1990, served
in Iraq, dishonorable discharge, armed robbery, assault, assault with a
deadly weapon, arson, attempted rape– your basic renaissance dirt
bag.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy,
would you make sure she’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re not going that route. Sonrisa’s not
someone you make deals with.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: What else can we do?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like I said– This isn’t my regular line of work
so I’m making it up as I go.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Mayor Steckler to see Mister Sonrisa.</p>
<p><strong>steroid case</strong>: I’ll need to search the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: It’s not what it looks like. I’m
diabetic.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bruno’s girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren’t
invited.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: No… Cause tonight the girls are here in a
more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you
don’t… Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, okay. I can explain… You ever have to do
something you really don’t want to?</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: How I make my living, what’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>redhead</strong>: Girl, you work that dress.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t rush off.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras. He wants
you to come see him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m on a break.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Guess again.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: The only thing better than four queens is…
…five. Over here next to me…for luck.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak
continues.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: I’ll bet you can. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Not right now? Okay, when?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Right after you change your wardrobe, your
personality and drop about thirty pounds.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Quite a mouth on a girl so young… …but my
guess is talking is not what it does best.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Only way you’re ever gonna find out is
reincarnation… Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you
with a service.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: I actually know how this works.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And I’m gonna give you Lauren Braganza.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Give us a minute. OUT!</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Check her.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card
list?</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Why I always use condoms.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: No wire.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Now that that’s out of the way… You want the
woman, here’s how it works. You pull fifty large out of your mattress or
wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Or we can work on your face with a pair of
pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Or we could go another way ’cause your boss
seems to like my face just the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The plan is I call her cell number to okay a
meet at a certain location.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, you’re a player… I’m bringing you this on
a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Pull the cash.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I don’t like this–</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: So, how do you get the woman to come to
me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I told her it’s just business to you, that all
you want is a reasonable solution to this. You give her daughter back,
she agrees to leave the country. I play the guarantor, drive her down to
Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: And she bought that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have sincere eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Make the call.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She’s gonna need to know that her little girl’s
alright.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: She’s got my word.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She’s gonna want to hear for herself.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not
give her a chance to think. If she hears her kid’s voice…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hang on, Lauren. We’re conferencing in
Sophy.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: Put the kid on.</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Sophy? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: Mommy, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m coming to get you.</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Soon, baby.</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: Mommy, I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: There’s nothing to be afraid of.
Everything’s going to be alright.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: I love y–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Can you put that in a bag or something?</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: You get it when I get her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay…idea. Compromise, right? Bruno here comes
with me. He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.
What you do with her after I’m gone doesn’t keep me awake nights.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: You better hope you’re as smart as you
think you are.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just
doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know? Comin’ off hard.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, sure, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I never woulda done it. Probably not, anyway.
I mean, I actually think you’re pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You’re attractive, you’re smart. Stand on
your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of
humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I
could do–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sooo…whattya think? Maybe after I betray the
woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute
them…we could go on a date. Play a little miniature golf or
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Man, you got a bad attitude.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I like to keep it professional, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Fine. So call her. Get her over here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Actually, that’s not gonna be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s not why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: What the hell are you talkin’ about? Call
her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Geez, you are so stupid the word special comes
to mind. They recruit you off the short bus?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Call the skank now or I start
redecorating.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You haven’t figured this out yet, have you? You
walk in here thinking you’re gonna cap her then cap me and take the
money back to your boss with your tail wagging… But see it’s really the
other way around. You think I’m the whack, when actually you’re the
whack.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: See what you don’t know is you’re already in
the last two minutes of your life.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You’re in the last two seconds, you don’t cut
the crap.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sonrisa had no choice but to call me in, ’cause
you lack the professional edge, Bruno. Any real pro would’ve popped me
already, the second he saw this thing going sideways, and you’re still
standing there figuring out what to do. It’s pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: See. Pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on, you’re not even trying.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bruno, Bruno, Bruno. Is that all you’ve
got?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The man was right, you are a liability.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You can hardly blame him, the way you’ve been
taking care of business…or should I say, not taking care of it.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes
down and stays down. Your’s makes it to the hospital where you then
gotta go finish the job. Only the cops got the whole thing on video
tape.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: That’s a lotta crap.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Security camera got you coming outta the
stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing
the patient. It’s embarrassing to the professional community, is what it
is.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: How come I never hearda you before?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m outta Portland. Sonrisa didn’t want local
talent.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is what your life’s worth, Bruno.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But the boss knows I always been loyal.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s got exposure. He sees you starin’ at
fifteen to life, there’s a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who
knows? Man’s figured the odds…and he can’t take a chance.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ass like your, I can see why he’s worried
you’ll punk.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who’s Camille?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This won’t hurt. Triple dose of insulin, you’ll
go into a coma, couple minutes you’ll stop breathing and on a busy
night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D. Plus, it’s way
classier than blowin’ your brains out.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Double-crossing sonuvabitch thinks I’d roll
on him… I’m gonna do a helluva lot more than that.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is your punk-ass client…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I need a favor… I need you to trace a number
for me.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Sure you wanna be havin’ this
conversation over the phone?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just do it… Five-seven-five-oh- eight…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …one-eight-three-two-zero.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Whoa…whoa…slow down…three-two-what was
it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Zero… C’mon, Dan I don’t have all day.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Got a pencil?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just give it to me. I’ll remember.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>vogelsang</strong>: Your best bet’s probably to take Fremont
to the second light–</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: I want a full perimeter seal. And nobody
goes in until I say.</p>
<p><strong>tac leader</strong>: It’s one girl. Why don’t we just take
her when she walks out the door?</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: Listen to me carefully. When you have the
streets locked off in front and back, plus the alleys on both sides, and
when you have a man on every door, window, airvent, mail slot and
rathole around this building, you come back and tell me you’re ready.
Okey-dokey?</p>
<p><strong>tac leader</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>lead thug</strong>: Get in there you mutt! Hit ’em again. You
pussy!</p>
<p><strong>lead thug</strong>: Go! Go! Aw jeeeez, did you see that?
You’re a waste’a clothes, you punk. I give up.</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: Standby. Full breach on my count. Three,
two–</p>
<p><strong>tac leader</strong>: Federal Officers! On the floor! Now!</p>
<p><strong>tac leader</strong>: Drop your weapons! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>lead thug</strong>: No! You drop yours!</p>
<p><strong>tac leader</strong>: DROP THE WEAPONS!!!</p>
<p><strong>lead thug</strong>: Whyn’t you come and get ’em!!</p>
<p><strong>lead thug</strong>: Alright! Alright! Alright! Jeeezz!!</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: Tac-One, what’s your status? Do you have
her or not?</p>
<p><strong>tac leader</strong>: Negative. We do not have the subject.
Repeat, we do not have the subject.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Need to see the boss.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: He doesn’t wanna be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: It’s kinda important.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>redhead</strong>: Right there… Oooh, that feels good.</p>
<p><strong>sonrisa</strong>: I like you better this way.</p>
<p><strong>sophy</strong>: Mommie…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Sophy…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Businessman Edgar Sonrisa was cut down in
a hail of gunfire at his Pacific Heights mansion late last night.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Eyewitnesses identified the assailant as
thirty-two year old Bruno Anselmo who died at the scene when bodyguards
for the reputed crime boss returned fire. Police are investigating.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Delivery for Jam Pony. Need a
signature.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: That’ll be a hundred twenty seven
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: C-O-D. From Ratterman’s Mortuary.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: You’re mistaken–</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: No… Thelonius Argentary at this
address.</p>
<p><strong>a.k.a.</strong>: That’s Theo in there?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Not until I get my money.</p>
<p><strong>normal</strong>: What’re you lookin’ at me for? I’m not his
next of kin. Anyway, I don’t got that kind of cash lyin’ around.</p>
<p><strong>herbal</strong>: Theo rode for this place a long time,
man.</p>
<p><strong>herbal</strong>: Keep your money, mon. We can take care of
our own.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll make sure this gets to his family.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: Gonna miss Theo.</p>
<p><strong>druid</strong>: A righteous dude.</p>
<p><strong>sketchy</strong>: So, who gets his bike?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This has been a Video Free America bulletin
via the Eyes Only Informant Net… Peace.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: See you’re back and still rocking the boat.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Somebody’s got to.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I would’ve come sooner, but…I didn’t… How’re
you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Not in any pain…the good and bad news of a
blown out spinal cord.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: My mother used to say the universe is right
on schedule. Everything happens like it’s supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’ve never been much for trying to understand
why bad things happen, I just know they do. So the job’s to figure out
how to deal with the consequences. Which you did… You took that
sonuvabitch out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, not me personally.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: On accounta you, Sonrisa didn’t get to buy
off the jury, or kill the judge. He’s gone. Once and for all. It was
war, Max, and you won.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s what soldiers do, right?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It turned up on the black market. One of my
sources thought I might be interested.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Deeds, not words. I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Forty-seven people drowned last night off the
coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get
into Canada so they could get work in order to eat. Only they got
marched overboard at gunpoint instead.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, thank you for this but–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: These girls, kidnapped during the last month
and sold overseas to the highest bidder. The oldest is twelve. The
youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And I feel real bad about all that but it
doesn’t mean I need to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You are involved. By being alive you’re
involved.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re quoting Mom again.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time
when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand
dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation. But the world got
a whole lot meaner all of a sudden. Wasn’t s’posed to, but it did. And
it’s back to the law of the jungle. You got your predators and you got
your victims.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And you still think you can do something to
change that.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: With your help.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Civilization as we know it is unraveling before
our eyes. But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march
into battle to keep that from happening.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: And whether you want to believe it or not,
you already fired the first shot. On another matter, Federal Corrections
used to keep records on distinguishing marks– scars, tattoos. I did a
search and came up with this.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That was taken nine years ago… I.D.’d as
Michael Hanover. Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins,
Wyoming for armed robbery. He escaped from custody after 4 days. Hasn’t
been seen or heard from since.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Zack… He made it… He’s alive…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I knew it… I always knew he was out there
somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Meanwhile, I got Logan on my ass about these
people and all their problems and how screwed up the world is and how we
gotta go out there and turn the mother around… Like I even care.</p>
