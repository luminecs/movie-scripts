AMENDMENTS TO THIS DATE</p>
<p><strong>richard donner</strong>: TOM MANKIEWICZ Shooting Script</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: :FILM CLIP MONTAGE REPRISE:</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Free!</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: Free!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: A group of well-bred, intelligent
gentlemen like yourselves must have better things to do than gallop
across the countryside, slaughtering defenceless animals ….</p>
<p><strong>hunter #1</strong>: Well that’s certainly given my knickers a
vile twist …</p>
<p><strong>hunter #2</strong>: Great blue git …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Keep the change …</p>
<p><strong>“lex luthor’s scheme bombs - superman saves world”
-</strong>: CRIMNAL DRAWS LONG SENTENCE, exclusive story by Lois Lane.
Photographs by James Olsen.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Golly, it’s a great story, Miss Lane …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: A picture usually isn’t worth a thousand words
when I write the article, Jimmy. But in this case - congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There’s Mr Kent! I’d bet he wishes he’d been
there when it all happened.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Poor Clark. For some strange reason he’s never
around when Superman appears …</p>
<p><strong>perry’s voice</strong>: Lane! Kent! Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: How are you, Lois…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, just… Super, thanks…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You’re late this morning, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Sorry, Mr White. I… got stuck in traffic.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Hmm. That’s a new one…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I mean as opposed to: “I had to make a phone
call”, or “I was locked in the washroom”, or …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: LOIS, what are you…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Listen. If you two want to bicker, that’s
great, because I got just the assignment for you. You’re going to pose
as a honeymoon couple, in Niagara Falls to get an expose of the newlywed
racket. Some of the hotels up there are bilking these kids for every
cent they can get. Real human interest stuff. Your Aunt Edna’ll cry her
eyes out.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Newlyweds? Us?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: That’s a great idea, Mr White.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: But I’m right in the middle of my series on
the City council, and …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, it won’t take long, Clark. We can just…
fly right up there and then sort of … zoom right back again. You know.
Like Superman.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Hey. If he could give you to ride we could
save a couple of bucks… I gotta go. Six lousy photographs and Olsen
wants to hit me for a raise…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well. You certainly look like the cat who
swallowed the canary this morning.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Canary? No. Actually I was thinking of
something much bigger that flies… something more in blue…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, as usual, I’m totally in the dark
about…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Here, Clark. Let me turn on the lights for
you.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Get the picture?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You know, I never started to put it together
before. And that’s funny, because a good reporter isn’t supposed to let
anything slip by her.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois? This is… very amusing Yes, Sirree, very
amus …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Tall, broad shoulders, dark hair… listen, I’ve
got to give you credit. I mean you fooled me… And I’m nobody’s fool -
Superman.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Su … Superman? You think I’m Superman?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Think? I’d bet my life on it. Literally.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois … you’re priceless… you know that? I
mean, that’s the single funniest thing …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, what do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m not worried, Superman. You won’t let me
die…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Will somebody shut the window!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois! Oh, thank God!…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark! Then you’re not…</p>
<p><strong>delivery man</strong>: Lady? Are you all right? Lady? .</p>
<p><strong>perry’s voice</strong>: Seventy-five dollars per week? Do you
have any idea what kind of salary I was making at your age?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Watch out for the banana, Chief … PERRY And
don’t call me Chief! Olsen, you really take the cake, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hey, Clark. You seen Lois around?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: She … just stepped out for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: So this is how it ends for the greatest
criminal mind of our time. Not with a whimper, mind you. Not with a
bang. With washwoman’s thumb…</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I know, Mr. Luthor. I know…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What could you know? You’ve only got a
twenty-year sentence. A sissy sentence. But how do they choose to reward
Lex Luthor, the world’s one true genius? Do they give me treasure? Do
they give me glory? What, in fact, do they give me?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Life plus twenty-five years. It almost worked
out, Mr. Luthor. The West Coast was almost destroyed. Millions of people
were alomost killed.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Almost. Almost, Otis. But as it turned out,
thanks to Superman, not one drop of blood was shed.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: All I want now is to get out of here and
destroy that miserable, glad-handing showboat.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: How? You’ve tried everything. Nothing seems to
stop him.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like
you, Otis, have several. I just didn’t find his in time. But now -
finally - thanks to my invention, patience, and skill - my black box is
nearly ready.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: That black box in your cell?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Ssssshh…..!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: That black box in your cell? What’s it
for?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: It’s only one sock…..</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Pegleg Horvath only needs one sock….. All
attempts to track Superman with conventional means have failed,
inclusing radar, correct? Correct. He flies at super-speed. And yet we
know that every so often, when he isn’t all tied up with “doing good”
and taking bows and kissing babies… he goes North. North. Where? We
don’t know. The tracking device always loses him…. now why would he go
North?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: To ski?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s incredible, Otis. Your brain defies all
known scientific laws….</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Luthor….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: In its infinite capacity to deteriorate…..
That black box, Otis - that innocent looking piece of devilish genius -
goes beyond all means of conventional radar. It tracks Alpha Waves.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Alpha Waves!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I could have said linguini, couldn’t I.
Well. No matter, Otis. You’ll hear of them again. Those Alpha Waves will
lead me North - to his secret. And when I have that secret - I’ll have
Superman.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Slasher Fogelstein is a bedwetter. Pass it
on.</p>
<p><strong>controller #1</strong>: Houson to Artemis, Houston to
Artemis, ome in please.</p>
<p><strong>voice from console</strong>: Howdy, Houston.</p>
<p><strong>controller voice</strong>: Dave? How’s it going up there?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: All systems normal, Houston. Robbie is out
doing the geological survey, and Boris is headed for crater 215 to get
some soil samples. Oh, by the way. Boris and I are getting engaged. Ah …
just a little detente-type humour there, Houston. I …</p>
<p><strong>controllers voice</strong>: Dave?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That’s it. Yeah, I’m dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>controllers voice</strong>: Come in, Artemis!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah … well … uh, Houston … we seem to have an
… an … unidentified flying … object.</p>
<p><strong>controller voice</strong>: Unidentified flying object? What
the hell do you mean? What does it look like?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, sir … actually, what it looks like, I
would have to say, it definitely looks like, like … a girl.</p>
<p><strong>controller #2</strong>: A girl. Call Dr. Kramer. I told you
they’d been up there too long.</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Ah … ah … yes. M’am? I don’t believe I said
that.</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: What sort of creature are you?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: M’am, I’m just a person … From earth, you
know? I’m just a man.</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: A man …</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Who are you? Where did you ….</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: What a fragile sort of life form this is….</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’ve lost contact with Robbie and Boris,
Houston. Don’t know what…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>controller voice</strong>: What is it? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>controller voice</strong>: Dave? Dave !</p>
<p><strong>controller #2</strong>: Dave? Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: Strange. I tore those metal fibres like paper.
And what he did…. Was amazing! Something is happening … ZOD Yes. To all
of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow
sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: They come from … earth. There … A place called
… Houston …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Then we must go there too. To rule. Finally -
to rule! And then you shall have what you want.</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: Men. To destroy.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: And I will lead.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: First we strike terror! Second, seize
control!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: 382 … check … 383 … check …</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Lights out, Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I said Lights out!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You guys are about ten seconds away from
solitary, you know that? Gimme that comic … The GUARD reaches out to
snatch the comic away from OTIS: his hand passes right through it as if
the book were made of air. The GUARD stops, wide-eyed, steps toward
LUTHOR who suddenly disappears completely. He turns back, steps toward
OTIS. Now OTIS disappears, but LUTHOR has reappeared. The stunned GUARD
looks down, sees he is standing in front of two beams of light. He
swivels to find their source as CAMERA PANS: They are being projected
from the corner by a small, complicated-looking holligraph device.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Break! Break!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Tell me again, Otis. Why am I going
first?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: To see if it’s safe for me, Mr. Luthor. Isn’t
that what you told me?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Yes, Otis. That’s what I told you.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey, you! Hold it right there!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I guess it wasn’t safe … Poor Mr. Luthor …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Well done, Miss Teschmacher.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why am I doing this? Why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is a
getaway.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: After all you haven’t meant to me, why am I
back with you? I must be a masochist.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’ll tell you what you are. You’re
beautiful. You’re beautiful when you drive.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: How would you like to take a little
vacation? I mean, you’ve earned it, you know? You deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: There is some good in you, Lex, after all.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You’ll have to pack quickly</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: A bikini! I’ll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.
C’mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven’t you thought about
me in a bikini … once maybe?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: A parka.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You thought about me in a parka. That’s sick,
Lex. Really.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: North!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: We’re going North, Miss Teschmacher.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: “Complimentary champagne”, a “Complimentary
corsage …”</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh, sure. Everything’s complimentary - until
you get the bill. Of all the dumb assignments …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Relax, Clark …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I am perfectly relaxed …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Then unclench your fist. Listen. We’re
reporters, right? We’re here to get a story, right? So loosen up a
little. Take my hand when we walk. Put your arm around me like the other
husbands do. For instance, at the newlywed’s dinner tonight …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: We’re not going.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Not going? That dinner could be the high point
of our whole story!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, you saw that sign in the lobby …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: “Vibrators available on request?”</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: The other one. The one about the … kissing
contest tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: So that’s it. Come over here, Clark. Kiss
me.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Come here, Clark …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Look, I’ve kissed people before, Lois …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’ll just bet you have. I know your type. The
closet lover.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Closets? I don’t recall …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Strip away all that shyness, that klutziness,
that feeble indecision, and underneath beats the heart of a rampaging
stud.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, please …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Lay one on me, Clark. Give it your best shot
…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Wow …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Was I … good?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I … think I’d like to go into the other room
now … get into bed … You know …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois … you mean …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: That’s right, Clark. I think I’m getting a
headache.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Mush, Miss Teschmacher! Mush!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Aha!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What have we here?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Ice. Snow. Your idea of a good time.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Fool! It’s his home! His home! Whatever
there is to learn about that piebald buzzard, Miss Teschmacher, we’ll
find the answers down there!….</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: His home? All the way up here? You must be
wrong, Lex.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Wrong? Lex? We do not use these words in the
same sentence.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: There’s the needle - right on target.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, there’s no number on the door, that’s for
sure. Not to mention no door….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And no welcome mat, no picket fence, no
American flag…. We are not in Nebraska, Miss Teschmacher….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No visible opening device. No doorknob. No
hinges. Fascinating. Impenetrable</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It was … open all the time, Lex. Isn’t that
funny?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: An open door is not funny, Miss Teschmacher.
Funny is a person trying to smile without her teeth.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Fantastic. The construction goes far beyond
all known architectural theory.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: This place is a work of genius! It lacks
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Well why didn’t you go before we left?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Two days ago?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I think it’s boring in here. Everything’s
white. Why doesn’t the guy put up a couple of prints? Bullfight posters,
or something.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Not even a cushion. No wonder they call him
The Man of Steel.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Now these are kind of pretty …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Get me that …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: The virtuous spirit has no need for thanks
or approval …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What the …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: … Only the certain conviction that what has
been done is right …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s his old man! The kid looks like him!
Are you his old man?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Ask him where the bathroom is.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: … Develop such conviction in yourself …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Are you here?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: … the human heart on your planet is still
subject to small jealousies …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Aahh, he’s not here! He speaks from the
past! Cute, very cute …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: … lies, and monstrous deceptions.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: So much for moral rearmament. Give me
another one …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Education crystal 108. Earth Culture. A
typical ode, much loved by the people you will live among, Kal-El.
“trees” by Joyce Kilmer. “I think that I shall never see a poem as
lovely as a tree; a tree whose branches wide and strong …”</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Good god!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hey wait! I love “Trees”.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: So does the average Cocker Spaniel …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: The man never changes his suit.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: My son, the time has come to tell you of the
darkest episode in Krypton’s history …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now this I want to hear …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Unfortunately, even on our peaceful planet,
there have appeared - once in a great while - certain anti-social
elements. Deviants. What you on Earth call criminals.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Criminals …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Deviants. He had it right the first time.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Of course, we are not a primitive planet
like Earth, and these unhappy souls were always successfully transformed
into productive citizens.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: They never met Lex Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: There were, however, three exceptions. Only
three, who proved - impossible to rehabilitate.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: But wait. There’s hope.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Non, the destroyer. Unreasoning violence in
the shape of a being … Ursa, vicious and cruel, obsessed by a
single-minded hatred which could never be deterred … and the one force
who could unite them, the only one whose warped genius could harness
these forces of evil: General Zod. His attempted insurrection was the
most painful episode our people ever had to endure. But after a long and
terrible battle, peace and harmony were once again restored …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What an anti-climax. LUTHOR is visibly
disappointed. EVE has disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: We had, of course, no death penalty …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Sensible enough …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: And so they were placed in the Phantom Zone
to be imprisoned for all eternity.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No possibility of parole?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: We have, of course, thought long and hard
about that question …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Hey! I asked the right question …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: The one danger we considered was that the
Phantom Zone might, we cannot know, just might be cracked by a nuclear
explosion in space.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: I cannot say I am glad you asked me that.
Because I do not know what could be done if they were to escape. On
Krypton these villains were uncontrollable. On Earth, each of them would
have the identical powers that you do ….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Think of it. Three, count ’em, three Super
Villains! All three with his powers, all three totally dedicated to
corruption, violence, and evil … They’d need a contact on Earth, of
course. Someone who felt the same way they did, someone with that same
wonderful contempt for life and decency … But it’s all too good to be
true, right?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Miss Teschmacher? Miss Teschmacher!</p>
<p><strong>eve’s voice</strong>: Found it! I think …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Just look at us, Lois. I mean here we are,
strolling along like any other happy couple on their honeymoon …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Uh-huh …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois - are you maybe feeling just a little
bit of what I’m feeling?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I am if you’re hungry. I’m sorry, Clark, but
if the truth be known - actually I was thinking of … someone else.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Why is it I suddenly hear a cape
flapping.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Well, I can’t help it if I’m a girl with a
one-track mind … And right now, it’s saying, “Feed me.” CLARK Two Hot
dogs - coming up.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Again! Again!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Sorry. Only one ride to a customer.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Where did he go now? And how come he just
happens to be here when….isn’t that funny, Clark? Clark?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And Clark isn’t here…..as usual.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: ….I mean when a girl reaches a certain point in
her life she starts to think about these things, you know? So we’re not
married. “Who cares?” I used to ask myself. Got that? I used to
ask……..</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Listen, Lex. I don’t want to push you into
anything….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’ll push you into something if you don’t
shut up………</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It can’t be…but it is…. it’s
unbelievable…but its true!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You broke your box.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Kryptonian Alpha Waves! Three sets of
them!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I didn’t know Superman had a family….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s them! The villains! The incorrigibles!
Those three little sweethearts are on their way! Do you realize what
this means? They can give me the world!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What do you want with the world? You don’t even
like the world.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: The world, Miss Teschmacher, is a lot of
real estate.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Land, land, always land ….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Which they’ll develop for me! As soon as
they get rid of Superman and we take over, I’ll put them to work! A
super construction crew! No, a destuction crew! Levelling forests,
moving mountains, creating coastlines! EVE Here we go again ….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And who do we have to thank for it?
Superman! For setting them free! Ah, Lex, you’re one hell of a fellow.
Even when you lose, you win. South, Miss Teschmacher! South! To
victory!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Whoops!…..</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, oh my gosh!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It’s all right now, Clark. I just didn’t hear
the knock, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, for goodness sake. The door wasn’t even
locked. I mean, just anyone can walk in here.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: There you go. Clark, running yourself down
again.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Anyway. Here. A little something for the
newlyweds dinner tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Pansies….Clark. How…different.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Would you believe they grow wild around here?
You should see what they’re charging for roses in the gift shop.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You know something, Lois? In spite of the
unreality of this all … posing as newlyweds and everything. In spite of
myself, even….I’m sort of finally starting to kind of feel like one, in
a way…..</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: A newlywed? You?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, I don’t see why it should be that
strange for me to ……</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m sorry, Clark. Really I am. I bet there’ve
been lots of girls who….. Well, a few anyway, who…..</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Go ahead and say it.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: That, that somehow I don’t seem to… shape up
in your eyes. Well, darn it, I have nothing to apologize for. I’m a god
reporter. And an even better friend to you - if you’ld let me, that
is.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Stand up, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Stand up?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Just for fun.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Look at yourself. Potentially, this handsome,
agressive, dynamite guy capable of anything he wants to do. It’s not my
fault, Clark - you run yourself down.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: How.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Well, in the first place - you slouch. Stand
up straight for once. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Good. Now - find yourself a jacket with more
than one vent. Shoes that don’t lace up. A shirt with some colour or a
pattern.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: All right, all right, Lois, you’ve made your
point. I know where it’s all leading and I’m sorry - but no matter how
hard I try, I’ll never be - him.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Him? Who?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Who else? Superman. I can’t help the fact you
seem to think you love him. That’s just something I’ve got to live with.
But darn it, Lois, it’s enough now. Maybe I just can’t stand the
competition anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And maybe you’ve just been the competition all
along.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, I’ve never been particularly good at
riddles….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Then let me give you an easy one. Why, with
thousands of children falling off something lethal somewhere else in the
world, why would Superman appear here - at Niagara Falls - today? Why
not the Grand Canyon?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Why don’t you ask the child’s family? I’m
sure they’d….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Any why is it always when I’m with you? Right
up to the moment, of course, when Superman appears. You’re never there,
are you? You’ve always just disappeared, somehow. And somewhat
conveniently, it’s always seemed to me.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I was getting us hot dogs, for Pete’s sake!
You were the one who asked me to!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And when Superman arrived on the scene I
looked over at that hot dog stand. You were gone, Clark. You were
nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I was….I was….darn it, Lois, just because I
had to go to the…..</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You are Superman. Aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, we’ve been through this hallucination
of your’s before. Don’t you remember what you almost did to yourself,
jumping out of a building thirty stories up? Can’t you see the tragic
mistake you almost made?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You’re right, Clark. I did make a tragic
mistake. What a fool I was….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I bet my life instead of yours.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois….don’t be insane….Lois, you’re
crazy!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I knew it. I guess I must really have known it
for the longest time…..</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You realise, of course, if you’d been
wrong….Clark Kent would have been killed.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: How? With a blank?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>lois’ voice</strong>: …we’ll need another couple of eggs…oh,
and while you’re out, maybe you can pick up a nice bottle of wine….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: And what else is missing?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: For the very first time in my life - nothing
at all.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Where did you learn to do that….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Here….just now….</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: Mamma mia!</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: Super-Cretino! Stronzo! …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Ready? …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Now listen to me, darling. I realise you’ve
never done this before and I nust have done it hundreds of times, so
just relax and do exactly what I tell you - all right?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m xxxxxxxx</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I understand. Okay. Easy now. Go ….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Slowly now….not too hot…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Stop! Never overcook a souffle….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s easy when you know the chef.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, yeah? Wait till we get into roasts and
poultry.</p>
<p><strong>no matter what swells up - you can keep it under
your</strong>: HAT - IF IT’S TEXAS-SIZE.</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: Hey. J.J. … what the hell day is
Halloween …</p>
<p><strong>ranger #2</strong>: I dunno. Sometime in October, ain’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: Hey, boy! You haul your ass over here!
And bring that jailbait and that monkey with you!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: You got things kinda ass-backwards,
dontcha, son? ’Cause that’s exactly what I aim to find out from you
…</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: I am your new ruler. You will kneel in my
presence. My name is General Zod.</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: Yeah, well General, your name’s gonna be
diddleyshit around here unless I see some I.D…..</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Kneel!</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: You! Get your hands on the car. Now! J.J.
- Call for another unit. Move your ass!</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: You will not die yet. I will keep you alive to
play with…..</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: Listen, lady, I never shot a woman in my
life, but so help me….</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Wait! Where was he calling? Who is your
superior?</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: Cap’n….Cap’n Moss of the Texas
Rangers….</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: And who is his superior?</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: Attorney-General Frieson of the State of
Texas….</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Another General….and who is his superior?</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: The Governor….</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: And his superior?</p>
<p><strong>ranger #1</strong>: He don’t rightly have one, but… well, the
President of the United States, I guess. In Washington, D.C. and then
there’s nobody, General. I swear. I mean that’s about as high as a man
can get.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Then that is the man I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>superman’s voice</strong>: And there….past the Desert of
Rozz, that’s the capitol city, KANDOR, where I was born….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: That’s my father, Jor-El … and my mother,
my … real mother. Her name was Lara … and that’s me … as a baby …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It’s amazing. I never really thought of you as
having a family like … everyone else. I mean you just sort of … were,
you know? Like a fact. A fact without a mother, or a father …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: There were so many times I wanted to tell
you. Sitting next to you as Clark, smiling shyly, listening to you talk
about Superman, and how much you … loved him …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: That’s all right. I suppose it is a little
late in the game for me to play hard to get.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s all real now, Lois - I’m real - and I
love you.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mmm. If you only knew what that felt like…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: The kiss? …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Not … exactly …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: ….Superman…..Superman….oh, Super….man…..</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: I am General Zod! Listen to me, people of the
Earth! CAMERA PULLS BACK: ZOD is perched on top of the Washington
Monument in Washington, D.C.. He stands erect on the pointed apex of the
tall, needle-like edifice, his voice echoing across the landscape as
terrified TOURISTS below scream, run away in panic.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Today I bring a New Order to your planet! One
which shall last until the end of time! Each of you……</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: ….each man, each woman, each child -
all will march proudly together in this New Order!</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: Your lands, your homes, your
possessions, your very lives……</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: All of this and more you will gladly give to
me!</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: There is no longer a need for separate
nations in this world, no need for petty squabbles between one group and
another …</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: All of you will work together, strive,
produce, and sacrifice together - and all for a common goal!</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: It is useless for you to resist as it
is for me to annihilate you …</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: You will only bring death and
destruction upon yourselves …</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: ….while I will lose the potential
products of your labour….,</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: There is now one law, one order, one
ruler who alone will determine your collective destiny! One force before
will all of you shall kneel forever!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: In return for this submission you will have my
generous protection! In other words - you will be allowed to live.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You are trespassing on Federal Government
property - illegally occupying a national monument…….</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: I will not repeat myself again! There is no
nation! Therefore there cannot be a monument to one!…..</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: From this day forward - there is only Zod!</p>
<p><strong>jor-el’s voice</strong>: The people of your Planet must be
well pleased with you, Kal-El. You have served them faithfully and they
are surely grateful for it. and yet, you have returned here to reason
with me once again.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: My son, I have tried to anticipate your
every question. This is one … I had hoped you would not ask. CLOSER ON
SUPERMAN</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: No attachment … The … feelings I have
developed for a certain human being have … affected me deeply,
father.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You cannot serve humanity by investing your
time and emotion in one human being at the expense of the rest.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: And … If I no longer wish to …. serve
humanity?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Is this how you repay their gratitude? By
abandoning the weak, the defenseless, the needy - for the sake of your
selfish pursuits?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Selfish! After all I’ve done for them?
Will there ever come a time I’ve served enough? At least they get a
chance for happiness! I only ask as much - no more.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Yours is a higher happiness! The fulfillment
of your missions! Your inspiration! You must have felt that happiness
within you … My son, surely you cannot deny that feeling.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Is there … no way, then, father? Must I
finally be denied the one thing in life … that I truly desire?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: If you will not be Kal-EL - if you will live
as one of them … love their kind as one of them, then it follows that
you must become … one of them.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: This crystal chamber has in it the harnessed
rays of the red sun of Krypton. Once exposed to them, all your great
powers on Earth will disappear. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Once it is done, there is no going back. You
will feel like an ordinary man. You can be harmed like an ordinary man
…</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Think, Kal-EL! I beg you!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Father, I love her.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: You are the one who is called President …</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: I see you are already practiced in worshipping
things that fly. Good. Rise before Zod …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: And now - kneel … before Zod.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: You are not the President. No one who leads so
many could possibly kneel so quickly.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m the man they’re protecting, General.
I’m the President. I’ll kneel to you - if it will save lives.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: It will. Starting with your own.</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: What a backward planet this is - where the men
wear the ribbons and jewellry …</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What I do now I do for the sake of the
people of this world. But there is one man here on earth who will never
kneel to you.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: And who is this imbecile? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: General - I wish I knew …</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Oh, God …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Zod.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: All right, Lois - what is it? I’m supposed to
be the shy one, remember?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It’s just that I’m … well, how would you feel
if you’d robbed the rest of the world of … I mean if it wasn’t for me,
you wouldn’t have … CLARK I didn’t do it for you. Lois, I did it for
us.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m going to wash up. Grab us a couple of
seats there.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m sorry, that seat’s taken.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: It is now … Coffee and a doughnut. How’d
you like for me to buy you a little breakfast, honey?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: How’d you like to blow up your pants? CLARK
comes up from behind, has heard.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Excuse me. That’s my seat.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: You’ve just been sittin’ on your seat,
four- eyes.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I think maybe somebody ought to teach you
some manners.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Yeah? Well you let me know when he comes
in.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark … it doesn’t matter … we can move …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Do you … ah … want to step outside?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: I don’t mind….</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: You don’t know when to lie down, do you,
buddy? …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, Clark … Clark … look at you …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What’s … the line? I … guess I just didn’t
know my own strength? …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It’s all right, Clark. You don’t have to prove
….</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Blood … my …blood …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Let’s get you inside ….</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now
on.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I don’t want a bodyguard. I want the man I
fell in love with.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here
…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Boy, what a mess …</p>
<p><strong>t.v. voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen - the President of
the United States.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This is the President. On behalf of my
country, and in the name of the other leaders of the world with whom I
have today consulted, I hereby abdicate all authority and control over
this planet … to General Zod.</p>
<p><strong>president’s voice</strong>: Only through strict compliance
with his directions will the lives of innocent millions be … Superman,
if you can hear me … Superman, where …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Who is this…. Superman?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You’ll find out, General! And when you do
…</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you!
Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: General Zod … here … But when ….</p>
<p><strong>counterman</strong>: When? Where the hell have you been, Mac?
How about that Superman, huh? He’s great at stuff like putting out fires
but when the real trouble comes, he splits.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I have to go back … to the Fortress …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: But what can you do? There’s no way now …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I have to try, dammit! Something, anything
….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Don’t … it’s not your fault … you didn’t know
…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: He knew. I heard him. I just didn’t
listen.</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: I’m bored with this puny planet. The men here
do not even try to resist anymore.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Then leave. There are dozens of other life
systems nearby. Find one that suits you.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Luthor’s the name. Lex Luthor. Maybe you’ve
heard of me. The greatest ciminal on earth?</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: I told you this was a puny planet. He
irritates me. Let me break his bones ….</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: If it pleases you …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Wait! Wait’ll you get to know me better.
Wait’ll I give you - exactly what you want. Unlimited freedom: to kill,
crush, main, destroy - plus: Lex Luthor’s savvy. Lex Luthor’s keen mind
guiding your careers!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: We have all of this without you. You cannot
bargain with what you do not have …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: With respect, your Magnificence, I am
bargaining with what you do not have: The son of Jor-El.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: The son … of Jor-El? Jor-El, our jailer?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No, Jor-El, the baseball player. Of course,
Jor-El, your jailer!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: His son? His son is on this planet?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Daily. Perhaps you’re more familiar with his
earthly non de voyage - Superman.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: So this … is Superman And how do you know
Jor-El?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: As I told your Fullness earlier - I’m just
about the best there is. Second best.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Revenge! We will kill the son of our
jailer!</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: Revenge!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now we’re cooking with gas! Have a phone,
they’re delicious…</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: But wait! He flies as well, then …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Constantly, your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: He has powers as we do …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Sure. But he’s only one. You’re three. Or
four even, if you count him twice.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: We will bring him to his knees!</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: Praying …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Yes. To me!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: But first! You’ve got to find him,
check?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: What … do you want.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: The world’s a big place, my General, but
thank goodness, my needs are small. And, as it turns out, I have a
certain weakness for beachfront property …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: What do you want!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Australia?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Father - if you can hear me - I have failed.
I have failed you, myself, and all humanity. I have traded my birthright
for a life of submission in a world now ruled by your enemies. There is
no one left to help them, father, the people of the world. Not since I
…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Father! ….</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Listen carefully, my son, for we shall never
speak again. If you hear me now, then you have made use of the only
means left to you - the crystal source through which our communication
was begun. The circle is now complete.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El.
You have abandoned the world for the sake of private ambition. You did
this of your own free will, and in spite of all I could say to dissuade
you.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I…..</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Now you have returned here to me for one
last chance to redeem yourself. This too - finally - I have anticipated,
my son. Look at me, Kal-El ….</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Once before, when you were small, I died
while giving you a chance for life. And now, even though it will exhaust
the final energy left within me …..</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Father, no ! ……….</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Look at me, Kal-El!</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: The Kryptonian prophesy will be at last
fulfilled. The son becomes the father - the father becomes the son.
Goodbye forever, Kal-El. Remember me, my son ….</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Father! ….</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: No, no, there’s three of ’em! That cockamamy
general, some big truck with hair on it, and a broad who looks like the
Queen of the Runway. All of ’em can fly , see through things -
everything Superman can do, they do. Where the hell is he, anyway …</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Maybe he hasn’t heard about it yet, Chief.
Maybe …</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Yea, and just maybe - he’s lost his guts. And
don’t call me Chief …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: He’ll be here … if there’s any way at all …
he’ll come …</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What the …</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Earthquake? … earthquake!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, that’s my new …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Lex Luthor …</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wouldn’t you know …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What a mess, what a mess … all of that
accumulated knowledge and they never heard of a doorknob …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You should see the White House. They’ll be
cleaning it for months.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: This - is the son of Jor-El?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: no … But I’ll bet you’re the son of a …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: You promised me the son of Jor-El!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I know, I know … but look at it this way,
your Grace - I got you the next best thing. You just hold on to this
little lady here and wait. He’ll be along. She does all his P.R. work,
you know? He gives her every exclusive. They’re sort of … best friends
….</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: What an undemanding male this Superman must be
…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You could use a tuck here and there yourself,
sister.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Wait! She lives - for now. Kill the rest.
Including him.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s Australia, isn’t it … it’s too much,
right? Listen, who needs it … I can turn over a new leaf … a hundred
leaves! Trees! Forests!</p>
<p><strong>superman’s voice</strong>: Haven’t you ever heard of Freedom
of the Press, General?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Thank God … I mean … get him !</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Come to me, Son of Jor-El! Kneel before
Zod!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Now, son of Jor-El! Submit, and swear loyalty
to Zod!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Not tonight, you pitiful little crackpot.
Never!</p>
<p><strong>zod’s voice</strong>: Yield, son of Jor-El! I command you to
yield!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Too many innocent people … have to get him
away …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Who would have thought this thing would go
the distance …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Admit defeat, you obstinate fool! Bow and
proclaim Zod your master!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Come on, General. Isn’t it time you joined
your troops?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Don’t! The people! …</p>
<p><strong>teenager #1</strong>: They … beat him … they beat Superman
…</p>
<p><strong>teenager #2</strong>: They didn’t beat him … he just … quit.
He ran away.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: So this is your Superman! A coward - like his
father! Go back to your homes, you meaningless insects! Go home and pray
- to Zod!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Our victory is complete! The son of Jor-El has
fled.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fled? …</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You said it. Three-to-one should get you
both ears and the tail.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: He ran in fear from us …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: He’ll be back. As long as he’s alive he’ll try
again.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: The next time - we will kill him!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Next time, next time … What am I going to do
with you people? I hold up my end. I deliver the Blue Boy - and what do
I hear from my triple threat? “Bow, yield, kneel” - that kind of stuff
closes out of town.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth …</p>
<p><strong>ursa</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: … with Superman’s address?</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: There is something more you want. The greed is
written on your face.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Perhaps a small … incentive, your Ultimate.
A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: What more?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: My ears are popping … Do you think we can
stop for some gum?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Hold it! Hey! Whoa! Down!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No drinks. No movie. This is the last time I
take a charter flight.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Son of Jor-El - prepare to die!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I don’t know … for me the door was always
open.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: He is one. We are three. It is the strength of
three that will defeat him.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Together … now!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Show yourself, coward! Son of a coward!</p>
<p><strong>superman’s voice</strong>: I’m here, Zod.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Let Miss Lane go and step inside. We’ll
talk.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman! No! …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Come out - or the woman dies.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Your powers are idnetical to mine, but we are
three. We could tear you limb from limb.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Do it, Your Grace! Grab his legs and make a
wish …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: But you are victim to another fatal weakness.
Your … Compassion. The death of others means more to you than your
own.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: With rare exceptions …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Your father once condemned us to eternal living
death. Your fate shall be the same. You will live, Kal-El. Forever - as
my slave. If not, then others will pay for your stubborn attitude.
Innocent people, millions of them if necessary … Beginning with her.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Don’t do it, Superman! Don’t …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Stop it! All right, Zod. You win. It’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Don’t believe him! You don’t know him, like
I do …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: I sense the presence of Jor-El here. Destroy
all this … And then kill him.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Me? General, it’s me, Lex Luthor! Remember?
Who got you through the tough times? You filled your inside straight?
You came to me with nothing - except the world. I gave you Superman!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You think you know people, right? Promises
are made, gifts exchanged … what does it all mean anymore? Not like the
old days when it was just you and me. And I’ve got to hand it to you,
Superman. You always told the truth. A fellow knew where he stood with
you. You wanted to destroy me, pure and simple - and I respected you for
it.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Perhaps there is some good in your after
all, Lex Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Me? I’m loaded with good! I mean I’ve never
even used it.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’ll have to take the chance. Try to get
them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces
them to human beings. Now if you could …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Wait! Don’t go in! It’s a trap!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Luthor, you poisonous snake …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s a molecule chamber, your Grace! It
turns people like you into … people like me.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: You have done well, Lex Luthor. We will award
you this Cuba place. Seize him!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: No! Please! Don’t! …</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Lex Luthor! Ruler of Australia and the Cuba
place! Activate the machine!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: And now - finally - kneel!</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: Take my hand and swear eternal loyalty to
Zod.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: He switched it! He did it to them! The
lights were on our here! He was the only one safe in there!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You’re a real pain in the neck, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I knew you’d double-cross me, Luthor. A
lying weasel like you couldn’t resist the chance …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did
you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Too late, Luthor. Too late …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Listen. Have I got a proposition for you,
Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don’t say yes or no till
you hear me out …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: … and who would be the wiser? We say you got
killed in the battle, you lie low for a couple of months at my place,
and then I bring you back - as a boxer! We start you slow at first, and
then - we pull the string! The Smallville Strongboy! The Metropolis
Masher! Don’t you love it? …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Plus - I only take ten … five per cent.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: He’s all yours, boys …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Three? Two? One?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Blast off.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Look, Lois, I …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Hey. No … regrets, you know? I mean I did it,
didn’t I? I got the man I love to love me?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: So okay, then. So they need you too. I’d be
buying my personal little rainbow at the cost of all those people who
say “Help. Come. Quick. Now” … you think I don’t understand that? It’s
the old eternal triangle, right? Except in my case I’ve got all of
humanity in the next bedroom</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: We’ll see each other. All the time, like
before. But it can’t be like …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’ve been working out.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Oh, no! I couldn’t have …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Sorry! But it’s okay now!</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: Cretino! Super, stronzo! …</p>

<p><strong>26/6/77 script notes</strong>: &amp; AMENDMENTS ————-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Well done, Miss Teschmacher.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why am I doing this? Why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is a
getaway.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: After all you haven’t meant to me, why am I
back with you? I must be a masochist.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’ll tell you what you are. You’re
beautiful. You’re beautiful when you fly.</p>
