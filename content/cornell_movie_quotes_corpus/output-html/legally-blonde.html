<p><strong>int. delta gamma house - day 1</strong>: “HEAD OVER HEELS” by
the Go-Go’s plays as we wind through a flock of abstract, silky, golden
strands – PULLING BACK, to discover that the strands are hair on a
BLONDE GIRL’s head. But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma,
the blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I love you, too!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: “Elle and Warner forever”. Aww…</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Jeremy, enough! I am not going to formal
with you.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Can someone please tell Rick that he is not
the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You guys are so sweet!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But I ’ m not positive it’s gonna happen to n
i g h t –</p>
<p><strong>. serena</strong>: Helloo…he just had lunch with his
grandmother. You know he got “The Rock”.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Why else would she have flown in from
Newport? It’s not like she’d Fed Ex a six carat diamond.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: I can’t believe you’re getting engaged!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: C’mon �– you have to help me pick out the
perfect outfit.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Amy, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t really – know anyone.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: That’s because you spend too much time in the
library. Come with me. I’ll meet you outside.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Bra ndon , Jason, Grant –this is Amy. Why
don’t you tell her about the time you guys went golfing naked?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It was classic. Jason hit with wood all
day.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: And we never ran out of balls –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Too demure?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: I think you should go with red. It’s the
color of confidence.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Well, I don’t want to look like I know what’s
coming. . .</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: I don’t understand why you’re completely
disregarding your signature color.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: He’s proposing! I can’t look like I would on
any date. This is the date. The night I’ll always remember. I want to
look special. Bridal . . . but not like I suspect anything.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: There ’ s nothing I love more than a
dumb blonde with daddy’s plastic.</p>
<p><strong>. serena</strong>: I can’t wait to see you wearing The
Rock!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Wh at if – you know – it’s not the night?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy?
You’ve been dating for a year – it’s not like he’s trying to impress
you.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Elle, you’ve heard the man pass gas in his
sleep. That practically means you’re pre-engaged. ’”</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Did you see this one? We just got it in
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Is this a low-viscosity rayon?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Uh, yes – of course.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: With half-loop top-stitching on the hem?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Absolutely. It’s one of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: It’s impossible to use a half-loop topstitch
on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn’t just
get this in, because I remember it from the June Vogue a year ago, so if
you’re trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong
girl.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Nice try…</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I’ll be the
future Mrs. Warner Huntington III.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So are you!</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I am so ready.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Here’ s to ~ us.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: The reason I wanted to come here tonight was
to discuss our future.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m fully amenable to that discussion.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I mean, we’re having a lot of fun now – but
things are gonna be different when I ’ m at Harvard Law school is a
completely different world. I need to be serious.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: My family expects a lot from me. And I
expect a lot from me. I .plan on running for office some day.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And I fully support that.</p>
<p><strong>wa r n er</strong>: But the thing is, if I ’ m gonna be a
senator by the time I ’ m thirty – I can’t keep dicking around.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I completely agree.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: T hat ’s why I think it’s time for us
to–</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I think we should break up.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I ’ m sorry, Elle, I just –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You’re breaking up with me?! I thought you
were proposing.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Proposing?! Elle, If I ’ m going to be a
politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a – Marilyn.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You’re breaking up with me because I ’ m too –
blonde?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: T hat’ s not entirely –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Then what? My boobs are too big?</p>
<p><strong>warner.</strong>: Elle – no –� your boobs are fine –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So when you said you’d always love me, you
were just “dicking around”?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I do love you, Elle. I just can’t marry you.
You have no idea the pressure I ’ m under. My family has five
generations of senators. My brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He
� just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: It’s not like I have a choice,
sweetheart</p>
<p><strong>8 ext.’ street - night 8</strong>: Elle teeters down the
sidewalk as best she can in her three inch heels, sobbing. Warner pulls
up alongside her in his convertible Saab.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: C’mon. Let me take you home.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Elle – it’s twenty miles back to campus.</p>
<p><strong>9 ext. delta gamma house - usc - night 9</strong>: Warner
pulls up in front. It’s a starry, romantic night. Everything should be
perfect. It’s not. Elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke
out.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Elle, believe me, I never expected to be
doing this, but I think it’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: How can it be the right thing if we’re not
together?</p>
<p><strong>warner .</strong>: I have to think about my future. And what
people expect from me.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So you’re breaking up with me because you’re
afraid your family won’t like me? Everybody likes me!</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: East coast people are different.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Just because I ’ m not a Vanderbilt, all of a
sudden I ’ m white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the
street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that’s way
better than a Vanderb ilt –</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I told you, Elle. I need someone –
serious.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m seriously in love with you – Isn’t that
enough? He looks away.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I ’ m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Why are you back so soon?</p>
<p><strong>serena .</strong>: Did he forget the ring?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Elle?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Where’s the Rock?</p>
<p><strong>serena and margot</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Is it a Kappa?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: It’s not a Theta –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No – it’s just – not me.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thank you, Serena, but I don’t think it’ll do
any good.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>; elle</strong>: I don’t know! Everything was normal at first
and then he said he needed someone mo r e – Serious! .</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: S e r i o u s ? ! Who the hell does he think
he i s ? Y o u ’ r e the most popu l a r month on the U S C
calendar!</p>
<p><strong>ser en a</strong>: O h , he is so over on this campus.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I just don ’ t underst a n d what went wrong
–</p>
<p><strong>ma rg ot</strong>: Maybe it’s the grandmother. Have you e v e
r me t he r ?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Last month on his birthday. And she liked me!
She said I looked like Britney Spears. Why would you say that to someone
you didn’t like?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: How could this happen?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I don’t know! I don’t know anything any more!
I just need to be by myself.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: We still love you. Sisters forever!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thank you. I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Oh, God. What if Josh doesn’t think I ’ m
serious enough? .</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Helloo… you let him have anal sex with
you.</p>
<p>****: Helloo… you let him videotape you diddling yourself. �</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: You’re right. Phew!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Elle?</p>
<p><strong>another sister �</strong>: Didn’t you hear?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I just love him so much! I loved him the first
moment I saw him. He’s beautiful and smart and someone I totally
respect. And I did everything I could to make him love me, but it wasn’t
enough. Now what am I supposed to do? I planned my whole future around
him. My life was going to be all about Warner. Now what’s it going to be
about?</p>
<p><strong>tv soap stud</strong>: “Oh, darling. I’ll love you
forever.”</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Honey, stop! You have to leave this room –
it’s been a week.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: What’s the thing that always makes us feel
better, no matter what? .</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Cunnilingus?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: No – the thing after that,</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: It was awful. We all thought she’d be the
first to walk down the aisle and now she’s totally adrift.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Oh, my God! .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Do you know who this is?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: It’s Warner’s older brother!</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>el le</strong>: He just got engaged to this – this very
unfortunate-looking girl. “Third year Yale Law student Putnam Bowes
Huntington III and his fiance Layne Walker Vanderbilt, first year Yale
Law.”</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: This is the type-of girl Warner wants to
marry. This is what I need to become to be serious.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Butt ugly?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No – a law student.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Elle? She’ll never get him back with those
cuticles.</p>
<p><strong>advisor</strong>: Harvard Law School?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>advisor</strong>: But it’s a top three school –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I have a 4.0.</p>
<p><strong>advisor</strong>: Yes, but your major is Fashion
Merchandising. Harvard won’t be impressed that you aced “History of
Lycra”. What are your backups?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I don’t need backups. Harvard is the school I’
m going to.</p>
<p><strong>advisor</strong>: Well, then. You’ll need excellent
recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and
at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey
contest. Trust me– I can handle anything.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Reading about the LSATs.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: My cousin had them. Apparently you get a
really bad rash on your –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: The LSATs are an exam.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Girls– I ’ m going to Harvard!</p>
<p><strong>� serena</strong>: What, like on va-kay?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Let’s all go! Road trip!</p>
<p><strong>. serena</strong>: Wait – Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let’s
go there!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No – I ’ m going to law school at Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: I mean, I know you’re upset and all, but
can’t you just take a sedative?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Once Warner sees me as a serious law student,
he’ll want me back. It’s a completely brilliant plan!</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: But isn’t it kind of hard to get into law
school?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Here. You’re gonna need this.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Your scrunchie?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass
Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>s er en a</strong>: You passed Spanish because you gave
Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Yeah, luckily.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. woods’ bel air backyard - day 19</strong>: ON VIDEO,

<p><strong>margot</strong>: Elle, do you know what happened on “Days of
Our Lives” yesterday?</p>

Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she’s been .
brainwashed by the evil Stefano –</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: Margot is now on all-fours, doing
donkey kicks as she grades Elle’s practice exam. She writes “143” on top

<p><strong>25 ext. beach - day � 25</strong>: ON VIDEO, Elle is
rollerblading in shorts and a tank top.</p>

22G!</p>
<p><strong>26 int. library study room - night 26</strong>: Elle sits in
front of Amy, as Amy quizzes her with practice LSAT questions. Books are
piled high around them. Elle gazes out the.window to see —Warner and
some BARE- CHESTED FRATERNITY BOYS carrying a keg across the quad. Her
eyes light up and she looks at Amy pleadingly. Amy shakes her head no.
Elle slumps, then rises and goes to the window, closing the shades and
getting back to work.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I feel confident using legal jargon in daily
life.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ON VIDEO, Elle walks across campus with

<p><strong>elle</strong>: And that’s why you should vote for me. Elle
Woods. Future lawyer. For the Class of 2003.</p>
<p><strong>admissions guy #1</strong>: That was certainly a very –
Imaginative essay.</p>
<p><strong>admissions guy #2</strong>: She does have a 4.0 from USC and

<p><strong>sapphire</strong>: You were first runner-up in the Miss
Hawaiian Tropic contest. Why throw all that away?</p>

a Ph.D in Biochemistry, and for the last eighteen months, I’ve been de-
worming orphans in Somalia.</p>
<p><strong>burned out 2l</strong>: Awesome. How about you, Enid?</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: P h.D from Berkeley in Women’s Studies–
emphasis in the History of Combat. And last year, I led the march for
Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.</p>
<p><strong>burned out 2l</strong>: Killer.</p>
<p><strong>intense ivan</strong>: I’ve got an MBA from Wharton, worked
on Wall Street for four years, mushed in three ididarods and I ’ ve
figured out how to crash the stock market in Sri Lanka if any of you
want to get together later.</p>
<p><strong>burned out 2l</strong>: Sweet. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree from
USC, where I was Sigma Chi Sweetheart and president of Delta Gamma, and
last year ’� – I was Homecoming Queen .</p>
<p><strong>ell e</strong>: Oh! Two weeks ago, I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred
Segal – and talked her out of buying a truly heinous angora sweater!
Whoever said that orange is the new pink is seriously disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. elle’s dorm room - day 38</strong>: A grey, dingy,
cell-block style room – now crammed with Elle’s clothes, the pink fluffy
love seat and potted palm, along with an Elliptical Cross-Trainer, pink
flamingo party lights and a neon pink margarita glass sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Wish me luck, Underdog. It’s my first class as
a serious law student.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I totally look the part!</p>
<p><strong>39 int. law school hallway - day 39</strong>: Elle heads for
a classroom, amidst a crowd of students who eye her like she’s an alien.
She rounds a corner, seeing –</p>
<p><strong>arrogant aaron</strong>: H l o t e e. . . . . . . el hr.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Elle?!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Warner?! Oh my God, I completely forgot you
were going here!</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: What’re you talking about? You’re not here
to see me?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No, silly. I go here.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: You go where?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Harvard. Law school.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: v- y</p>
<p><strong>e ll e.</strong>: W h at , like it’s that.hard?</p>
<p><strong>. elle</strong>: Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the
benches?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Uh – sure.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. civil procedures class - day 4.0.</strong>: Students
file in and take their seats. Elle enters, looking around nervously at
the imposing auditorium. Arrogant Aaron, next to her, leans over.</p>
<p><strong>arrogant aaron</strong>: If you’re looking for the best seat,
I hear the front row is the place to be.</p>
<p><strong>elle �</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>41 int. civil procedures class - day - later 41</strong>:
PROFESSOR ELSPETH STROMWELL, a tough-as-nails Grande Dame in her 50’ s ,
addresses the class. Laptops abound – except for Elle, who has a fuzzy
pink notebook and a pen with a pink plastic heart on the end.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: A legal education means you
will learn to speak in a new language. You will be taught to achieve
insight into the world around you, and to sharply question what you
know.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: The seat you’ve picked is yours
for the next nine months of your life. Enjoy it. And those of you in the
front row, beware. . ..</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: “The law is reason free from
passion.” Does anyone know who spoke those immortal words?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: Aristotle.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: ~ Would you be willing to stake
your life</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: I think so…</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: H o w about –</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: – his life?</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Well, I recommend knowing
before speaking.. The law leaves much room for interpretation – but very
little for self-doubt.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: And you were right. It was
Aristotle.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: I assume you’ve all read pages
1- 48 and are now well-versed in subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Who can tell us about Gordon v.
Steele?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Ivan Greenstein?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Gordon sued her doctors for malpractice.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: And what did the dispute
entail? Let’s call on someone in the hot zone. Elle Woods? Elle looks
up, distressed.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Uh… I wasn’t aware that we had an
assignment.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Sarah Knottingham?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Do you think it’s acceptable
that Ms. Woods is unprepared?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Would you support my decision
to ask her to leave and return to class only when she is prepared?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Now, Ms. Knottingham, did
diversity jurisdiction’exist in this case?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Do they just – put you on the spot like that?
Like, all the time?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: The professors? Yeah, they tend- to do that.
Socratic method.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And if you don’t know the answer, they just
kick you out?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You have Stromwell.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Did she do that to you, too?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: No, but she made me cry once. Not in class –
I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel
your balls – or you know, your whatevers .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Neat . � ’ , ’</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Don’t worry. It gets better. Who else do you
have?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Speak up in Donovan’s class. He likes people
with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he
talks about products liability.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: And make sure you read the footnotes in
Levinson’s class. That’s where all her exam questions come from.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Wow. I ’ m glad I met you.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Oh, and getting one of Stromwell’s daily
quotes right is almost as important as acing the mid-term. But you
didn’t hear it from me.</p>
<p><strong>elle ” .:.</strong>: Are you a third-year?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thanks again for your help!</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: S o – uh – how was your first class?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made
me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You’re here
now.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: How was your summer?</p>
<p><strong>� warner</strong>: Good. Good.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Do anything exciting?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Urn, hey, have you met Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hi. Sarah Knottingham.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: � You know her?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: She ’s –</p>
<p><strong>sarah .</strong>: – I ’ m his fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’m sorry, I just hallucinated.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We
got back together over the summer at my grandmother’s birthday
party.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Warner told me all about you. You’re famous
at our Club.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: But he didn’t tell me you’d be here.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I didn’t know –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I thought you said she was pretty.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. beauty oasis - day 44</strong>: A downscale,
blue-collar salon, with five hair chairs and two manicure stations. Old
ladies and young waitresses get perms. PAULETTE –early 40s, lower-middle
class, hard-edged, plus- sirzed – looks up as a defeated Elle sinks into
the manicure chair. . �</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Bad day?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You can’t even imagine.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: .Spill.,</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I worked really hard to get into law school –
I blew off Spring Break and Greek Week to study for the LSATs, I
completely neglected my Homecoming Queen duties, I hired a Coppola to
direct my admissions video – all so I could get my boyfriend Warner back
and now he’s engaged to this awful girl Sarah so it was all for nothing!
I wish I ’ d never even come to Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: After you went to all that trouble?</p>
<p><strong>elle :</strong>: Well, what am I supposed to do? He’s
engaged! She’s got the family six-carat on her bony, unpolished
finger.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: You’re asking the wrong girl. I ’ m with
my guy eight years and then one day it’s “I met someone else. Move
out.”</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds.
Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: I didn’t even get to go to his birthday
party.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>paul ette</strong>: What could I do? He’s a man who followed
his pecker to greener pastures. I ’ m a middle-aged high- school dropout
with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women
like me.</p>
<p><strong>elle . �</strong>: That’s terrible!</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: So, what’s this Sarah got that you don’t?
Three tits? -</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: She’s from Connecticut. She belongs to his
stupid country club.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Is she as pretty as you?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m not pretty – I ’ m genetically
blessed.</p>
<p><strong>pa ul ett e</strong>: Is sJie.? ”</p>
<p><strong>ell e</strong>: She could use some mascara and some serious
highlights, but she’s not completely unfortunate- looking.</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: Hello, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>ups guy .</strong>: See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Definitely! I love him!</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: If a girl like you can’t hold on to her
man – then there sure as hell isn’t any hope for the rest of us. What’re
you waiting for? Steal the bastard back.</p>
<p><strong>45 int. dormitory - warner’s room - day 45</strong>: Elle
knocks on Warner’s door, bottle of wine and two glasses in hand.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Warner?</p>
<p><strong>46 ext. harvard law campus - day 46</strong>: Elle is in her
push-up bikini, reclining in her beach chair, pink frozen margarita in
one hand, Underdog in the other, law book in her lap, pretending to
study. We PULL BACK to reveal that she’s sitting on the sidelines of a
touch-football game that Warner is playing with a group of other 1-L’s.
Warner scores easily because the other male eyes are all on Elle. He
shakes his head and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: I should warn you that in
addition to competing against each other for the top grade in this
class, you’ll also be competing for one of my firm’s highly coveted four
internship spots next year where you will get to assist on actual cases.
Let the bloodbath begin. Now, let’s commence with our usual torture
–</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Ms . Woods –</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This should be amusing.</p>
<p><strong>� professor donovan</strong>: Would you rather have a client
who committed a crime malum in se or malum prohibitum?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Neither.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’d rather have a client who’s innocent.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: . Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.
Ms.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Malum prohibitum. Because the client would’ve
committed a regulatory infraction as opposed to a dangerous crime.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Yes? Ms. Woods?</p>
<p><strong>’ elle ’ ..</strong>: I changed my mind. I ’ d pick the
dangerous one.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m not afraid of a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. study lounge - day 48</strong>: The Harvard Public
Interest Law Association meeting is</p>
<p><strong>49 int. cask &amp; flagon restaurant - night 49</strong>:
Elle waits for Warner, alone at a table. Checking her watch to see it’s
8:45, she tries not to be sad.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. harvard law library - day 50</strong>: Warner and his
study group, Sarah and Claire included, sit at a table, going over their
outlines. Elle walks up to the table, holding a basket of muffins,
bright smile on her face.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: ’ I ’ m here to join your study group. And She
holds up the muffins as the others look up, frowns all around.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Elle, what’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Who’s first?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Our group is full.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No, it’s like a smart people thing. And like
Sarah said, we’re full.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Come on ~ we can make room for one more.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’ve already assigned the outlines, and
everyone has started theirs’,</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Besides, you wouldn’t let the fat guy</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: He tried to watch me take’a shower!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The answer is no.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Then I guess I’ll leave you alone.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Maybe there’s a sorority you could join
instead.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You know, if you’d come to a Rush party, I
would’ve at least been nice to you.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Before you voted against me and called me a
dyke behind my back?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I don’t use that word. Only mean people use
that word. You must’ve heard it from Sarah. .</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: It’s Elle! Guess what I ’ m doing right this
second?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Power yoga?</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Picking out my wedding dress!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: � What?!</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Josh proposed!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: N o way –</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: ;;po you have The Rock yet?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss
you!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I miss you guys! The people here are so vile!
Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it’s to say something that’s not
nice. Law school sucks!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell
you!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: I got bangs!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Re a ll y –</p>
<p><strong>margot :</strong>: Keep June first open – you’re one of my
bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Iwl.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s not just any Halloween party. It’s a
“Come as Your Favorite Defendant” party.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That-’s genius.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No way! Someone at this school is actually
having a party?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You must’ve heard us wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sorry. Looks like you’ll be staying home ton
ig ht. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>54 int. elle’s dorm room - continuous 54</strong>: Elle shuts
the door behind her and looks at Underdog.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I can’t believe this. Not only do I not have
Warner, but I ’ m –unpopular!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But I wasn’t invited.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You really think I should?</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: The English language is all about subliminal
domination. Take the word “semester”. It’s a perfect example of this
school’s discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries. That’s why I ’ m
petitioning to have next term be referred to as Winter Ovester.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Hey , Elle– I’ve been meaning to ask you – are
those real?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Enid, please – silicone is so 90’s.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thanks for inviting me, girls. This party is
super fun.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re supposed to be dressed as a famous
defendant.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I am. Didn’t you hear about the Playboy Bunny
who slit her ex- boyfriend’s new fiancee’s throat with a broken wine
glass? It was tragic.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Hey, O.J.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Wow. You’re a walking felony.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thank you. Having fun?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Now I am.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I feel like we’ve barely spent any time
together since we got here.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: That’s because I spend all my time with case
studies and hypos.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Tell me about it. I can’t imagine doing all
this and Donovan’s internship next year.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Elle, c’mon, there’s no way you’ll get the
grades to qualify for one of those spots . You’re not smart enough.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I didn’t mean –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same
law school you did, Warner?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: We ll , yeah, but –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But what? We took the same LSAT, we take th e
same classes –</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I just don’t want to see you get your hopes
up. You know how you get.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’11 never be good enough for you, will</p>
<p><strong>i?</strong>: When he doesn’t answer, she walks back into the
house.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: I give her two more weeks.</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: Two and a half?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If she spreads her legs, maybe –</p>
<p><strong>arrogant aaron</strong>: Only if I ’ m feeling generous.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We’re betting on how much longer you’re
going to last.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look around, Elle. Do you actually think you
belong here?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Why wouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Because the rest of us provide some worthwhile
value to society?</p>
<p><strong>arrogant aaron</strong>: Hold on, now – every society needs a
bimbo. Who are we supposed to sleep with after we get rich?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You know what? All of you can just kiss my
ass.</p>
<p><strong>’ elle</strong>: You’re about to see just how valuable Elle
Woods can be.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Wasn’t gonna. -</p>
<p><strong>63 int. study lounge - day 63</strong>: Enid is surrounded by
study materials and notecards. When she gets up to use the ladies’ room,
Elle casually walks over and slips a notecard into the middle of Enid’s
stack. Then quickly walks on. ’</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: And the purpose of “diminished
capacity” is?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: To negate mens rea?</p>
<p><strong>71 int. civil procedures class - day 71</strong>: Professor
Stromwell is in front of the class.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: So you’ve filed a claim. Now
what?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Ms. Woods?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Don’t you also need to have evidence?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>’elle</strong>: Meaning you need – reasonable belief that
your claim would have, like, evidentiary support?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: And what kind of evidentiary
support does this case require? Let’s ask Mr. Harriman, who clearly
believes that I might be hungry.</p>
<p><strong>72 ext. beauty oasis - night 72</strong>: A “Closed” sign is
on the door. THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see Elle and Paulette sitting in the
empty salon, laughing and clinking cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon as they
toast Elle’s small victory. We PULL BACK, leaving them laughing, as the
MONTAGE ENDS.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. criminal law class - day 73</strong>: “THE STATE V.
LATIMER” is written on the board. A pony- tailed, less made-up Elle
takes notes on her lap-top, as Warner makes an argument.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: . According to Swinney v. Neubert, Swinney,
who was also a private sperm donor, was allowed visitation rights as
long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents. So, if
we’re sticking to past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn’t st al ki ng – he
was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation.</p>
<p><strong>professor donqvan</strong>: But Swinney was a one-time sperm
donor, and in our case, the defendant was a habitual sperm donor, who
also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for
visitation.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: But , without this man’s sperm –the child in
question would not exist.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Now you’re thinking like a
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Ms. Woods?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The idiot speaks.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent
point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each
sperm emission made throughout his life?</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Well, unless the defendant attempted to
contact every single one-night- stand to determine if a child resulted
in those unions – then he has no parental claim whatsoever over this
child. Why this s p e rm ? Why now? ’</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: For that matter, all masturbatory emissions
where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg could be termed reckless
abandonment.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: I believe you’ve just won your
case.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: You did well today.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: You’re applying for my
internship, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I don ’ t know –</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: You should. Do you have a
resume?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: ” ��‘.’ . � �. . . i do. ’ ’ , .’‘. �’ . . � ;
. .</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: It’s pink.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And engraved… Gives it that extra little
something, doesn’t it? . See you tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I brought you the Windham notes.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: You think she just woke up one
morning and said, “I think I’ll go to law school today!”?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Aside from that lapse in judgement – she’s
got potential.</p>
<p><strong>75 int. elle’s car-day 75</strong>: Elle drives. Paulette is
shotgun. �</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: You showed up Warner in class? You’re
supposed to be showing up Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I couldn’t help it! It was the most fun I’ve
had since I’ve been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner
– I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan
was impressed, and he’s a total hard- ass.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Yes, you are. Go – you can do this. .</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What the hell do yon want? We’re eating
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: I just –</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: You just thought you’d come over and show me
what I ’m definitely not missing?</p>
<p><strong>� paulette</strong>: That’s not what –</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: How many times you gonna show up here,
beggin1 me to take you back? ’</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Dewey Newcomb?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Who’s askin’</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: . I ’ m Elle Woods. Ms. Bonaf ante’s � .
attorney.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Under state law, you and Ms. Bonaf ante had a
common law marriage which entitles her to the benefits of property law
and an equitable division of assets.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Due to the fact that you retained the
residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine
property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>dewey :</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: W e did it! .</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: God, that felt great!</p>
<p><strong>elle �</strong>: Look at him. He’s still scratching his
head.</p>
<p><strong>paulette .</strong>: Which must be a nice vacation for his
bls . . al.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: And now Mommy’s got somebody to eat dinner
with again. You don’t care what Mommy’s butt looks like, do you?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: “An image and a good hook can
get you into a room –� but something has to keep you in that room.”</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Mr. Greenstein?</p>
<p><strong>intense ivan</strong>: Judge Sandra Day 0’Connor?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: C ose.. . . l</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Madonna?</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: Damn. Thought I ’ d get
everyone on that one.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: Donovan’s firm is defending a major
murder case and his caseload is so heavy he’s taking on first year
interns.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: He chose them already?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We got it!</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: The competition must not have been that</p>
<p><strong>arrogant aaron</strong>: Why? ion .got a spot?</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Hey! Watch your hands, Mr.Grabass.</p>
<p><strong>arrogant aaron ’</strong>: That only leaves one for –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Me?!</p>
<p><strong>el le</strong>: �</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: This is way better than that. Excuse me. I
have some shopping to do.</p>
<p><strong>82 int. sak’s - womens’ dept. - day 82 �</strong>: Elle scans
the racks of conservative clothes. She holds up a cashmere twinset and
wrinkles her nose, but throws it over her arm anyway.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. nordstrom’s - handbags - day - later 83</strong>:
Elle admires a trendy handbag, but then promptly sets it down and picks
up a practical leather briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. austen, platt, jaret &amp; donovan - lobby - day
84</strong>: The elevator door opens and Warner and Elle emerge. Elle is
sporting her new, boring “lawyer” clothes. Warner is baffled and
impressed by her transformation.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: You look – nice.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>85 int. austen, platt, jaret &amp; donovan - day - moments
later 85</strong>: Donovan strides through the office, his four interns
behind him. He points as he walks.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: There’s your office, there’s the bathroom,
there’s the coffee machine. There’s Gerard, Dick and1Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: They’re the other associates on the case.
Ask them all your stupid questions, save the smart ones for me.</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: We’re defending Brooke Windham,
whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill
mansion.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Gold digger?</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: You’d think so, since the stiff
was sixty, but she was rich on her own. Some kind of fitness empire. You
can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Wait a minute – are we talking about Brooke
Daniels?</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: M a i d e n name–Daniels. You
know her?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class
or anything – she graduated ,five years ahead of me. But I used to take
her class at the LA Sports Club. She’s amazing!</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Amazing how?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: She could make you drop three pounds in one
class. She’s completely gifted!</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: Well, in all likelihood, she’s
completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband’s dead
body.</p>
<p><strong>wa rn er</strong>: B y who?</p>
<p><strong>sa rah</strong>: Whom?</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: His twenty-seven year old
daughter and the pool boy.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Maybe she found him like that.</p>
<p><strong>p ro f es s or donovan</strong>: That’s the story she’ll be
telling the jury. We just have to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Sorry I ’ m late.</p>
<p><strong>p r o fe s so r donovan</strong>: This is Emmett Kerrigan,
another associate. Top three in his class and former editor of H a r v a
r d Law Review. You’ve probably seen h i m lurking around campus doing
my research.</p>
<p><strong>em me tt</strong>: Or napping on the quad. .</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: What about the murder weapon?</p>
<p><strong>p r o fe s so r donovan</strong>: The gun is missing. The
coroner said he’d been dead thirty minutes dead when the cops arrived –
giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: There’s no way Brooke could’ve done this - -
exercise gives you endorphins, endorphins make you happy – happy people
don’t kill their husbands!</p>
<p><strong>professor donovan</strong>: You don’t really believe she’s
innocent?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Of course, I do!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Then we may actually have a case.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What alibi?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>’ donovan</strong>: You understand you’re on trial for murder
?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I didn’t do it! I walked in, saw my husband
lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off
and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Where they saw you standing over the body
covered in his blood.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Why would I kill my husband?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Insurance? A love affair? Pure
unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of
reasons.</p>
<p><strong>b roo ke</strong>: I l ov ed h im !</p>
<p><strong>do no va n</strong>: He was thirty-four years older than you.
That doesn’t sound so good to a jury.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Then show them a picture of his cock. They
might put a few things together.</p>
<p><strong>donovan , .</strong>: Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is
gonna want an alibi.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I can’t give you that. And if you put me on
the stand, I’ll lie.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Were you with another man?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I’ll take that as a no.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Are we done for today?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I believe we are.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Hey – I know you.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m a Delta Gamma and I ’ m a huge fan of
yours!</p>
<p><strong>br ooke</strong>: You took my class in LA. You had the best
high kick I’ve ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Well, thank God one of you has a brain.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I feel so bad for her. I mean, she’s in jail!
And she’s innocent. But I ’ m the only one who believes her. Donovan
totally thinks she’s guilty.</p>
<p><strong>. paulette</strong>: That’s because men are big, fat retards
who don’t – Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: Afternoon, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: It’s him!</p>
<p><strong>elle ’</strong>: It’s who?</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: I’ve got a package.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: He’s got a package. �</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: How ya doin’ today? .</p>
<p><strong>paulette . �</strong>: Fine?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So, this is the only interaction you two have
ever had?</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: No. Sometimes I say “Okay” instead of
“Fine”.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Have you ever considered asking him if he’d
like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: What’s the point? Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I am. And I’m looking at a beautiful,
fabulous, sexy woman.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Good one.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Trust’me. You’ve got the equipment, you just
need to read the manual.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m going to.show you a little maneuver my
mother taught me when I was in junior high. In my experience, it has a
98% success rate in getting a man’s attention an d when used
appropriately–an 83% rate of return on a dinner invitation.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: It’s called the “Bend &amp; Snap”. “Oh, look!
There’s something on the floor that I need to pick up!” Bend…</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And snap! Now you try.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Bend…and snap!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Good. Now this time, put a little arch in your
back and maybe get your footing more solid.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>hair client</strong>: Like this? .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But cock that knee.</p>
<p><strong>another client</strong>: Am I doing it right?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: More snap, less bend.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: C’mon – everyone try!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Now everyone together.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Bend –</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: And snap !</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Oh, my God! The Bend &amp; Snap! Works
every time…</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: I got out of the shower,” walked
downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Did she have a weapon in her hand?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Was there any reason for you to believe she
had discarded a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Was there any evidence that Mrs . Windham
shot him?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: His dead body with a bullet in it. .</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What did you see when you entered the
house?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body
of Mr. Windham.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Was she carrying a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>� enrique</strong>: No, she was crying her eyes out.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: So she was distraught that her husband was
dead?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet,
wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She
could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very
close.</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: She’s screwing the pool boy.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: There is no way a Delta Gamma would sleep with
a man in a shiny shirt. Warner, back me up here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I hate to agree ~ but I don’t see the two of
them actually – – doing it.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Women like that will screw anything.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So, because she’s beautiful and has a good
body, she’s easy? What book of feminist theory did you read iiiai in,
Enid?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Okay, if Brooke didn’t kill the guy, who
did?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: My money’s on the angry daughter or the
ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Chutney has a trust fund. She didn’t need
the insurance payoff or the inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What about her mother?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Covered. She was in Aspen at the time. Ten
people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Al l I know is– it’s not Brooke.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: That’s touching, Elle, but we need an
alibi.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m here to see Brooke Wi’ndham.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Licensed attorney or family member?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Uh – family.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Relation?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m her sister.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Delta. Gamma.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Are you okay? You look so sad…and so</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I ’ m glad it’s you and not Donovan.</p>
<p><strong>. elle</strong>: He means well. He’s really brilliant and
all.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: He better be, for what I ’ m paying him.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I brought you some necessities. Pink sheets.
Aromatherapy candles. Loofah. And The Bible.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: You’re an angel.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But I have to tell you the real reason I ’ m
here. Professor Donovan says we really, really need your alibi.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Elle, I can’t. You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Who could better understand than me?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: It’s so shameful…</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Whatever it is – it could save you.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: That’s just it – it would ruin me!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I have made my fortune on my ability to
teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke’s Butt Buster
workout.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I know! You helped me go from a six to a
four!</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: On the day of Heyworth’s murder, I was –</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: – getting liposuction.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I ’ m a fraud! But it’s not like normal
people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I ’ d lose everything. I’ve
already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my
reputation!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Your secret is safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: .. We’ve got two interviews tomorrow
that</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Sarah, can you grab me some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: And according to this communique from the
prison, our client apparently had a visit fr om her sister? A Miss Delta
Gamma –</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Anyone you know?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I went to get her alibi.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But I can’t tell you what it is.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>’ elle</strong>: I promised her I ’ d keep it secret. I can’t
break the bonds of sisterhood!</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Fuck sisterhood. This is a murder trial,
not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I can’t give it to you. All I can tell you is
that she’s innocent.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Mr. Donovan? Mrs. Windham Vandermark is
on line two.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Someone reason with her while I take
this.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Are you crazy? Tell him the alibi.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: , No!</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: We’re gonna lose the case if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Then we’re not very good lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: If you tell him, you’ll probably make summer
associate. Who cares.about Brooke? Think about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I gave her my word, Warner.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with
the fact that her interview is today. She’s at a spa in the
Berkshires.</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: A spa? Isn’t that like, your
Mother-Ship?</p>
<p><strong>elle .</strong>: I can go if you want.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Why you?</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: Have you ever been to a spa?</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: And subscribe to the doctrine of self- hatred
imposed upon my gender by male delusions of the way women are supposed
to look? Twice.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Go with her.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Explain to me why you’re so anti- Brooke.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Uh, for starters, she won’-t give us an al i
bi –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Aside from that.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: She’s completely untrustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: She married an old man, she’s made a living
on telling women they’re too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home
Shopping Network…</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: He’s an old man with a really big She never
told me I was fat. Victoria Principal sells on that network.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Brooke is obviously hiding something.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But maybe it’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Bu t maybe it is– .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You’re kind of being a butt-head right
now.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: How do you figure?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Because people aren’t always what they seem to
be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I can’t believe you called me a butt- head.
No one’s called me a butt-head since ninth grade.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Maybe not to your face…</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: We have two o’clock massages. Kerrigan and
Woods.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Go on back. .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Oh, and my friend Katherine Windham Vandermark
is here somewhere and I ’ m supposed to meet her. for a Pilates class.
Do you have her schedule?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: She’s in the mud room until four.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Damn. We can’t see her for an hour?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: No, she can’t move for an hour.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Mrs. Windham Vandermark?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: We’re here from Austen, Platt, Jaret &amp;
Donovan –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. windham vandermark</strong>: So, you found me.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: She’s naked.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. windham vandermark</strong>: I ’ m covered in very
expensive Egyptian mud ��– hardly naked.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’ll cover her – parts.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. windham vandermark</strong>: So, I hear the tart from
California shot - Heyworth.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Well, that’s what we’re trying to prove
didn’t happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. windham vandermark</strong>: I never met the woman, but
from what my daughter tells me, she’s quite the cun–</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: She’s not!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Did your daughter ever say anything to you
about Brooke and Heyworth’s relationship?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. windham vandermark</strong>: Aside from the fact that he
found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas .
Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I ’ m sure that was very awkward for
Chutney. Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. windham vandermark</strong>: But I guess it wasn’t
enough for Brooke.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs . windham vandermark</strong>: Haven’t you seen the
cabana boy?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Ys. . . . e</p>
<p><strong>mrs. windham vandermark</strong>: Like I said, I’ve never met
Brooke, but I have seen her from a distance. When I ’ d come over to
pick up the alimony check that Heyworth forgot to mail every month,
she’d be out by the pool, with Mr. Hot Pants hovering over her with some
pink drink.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Hovering?</p>
<p><strong>mrs . windham vandermark</strong>: I didn’t stick around long
enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I ’ d bet
my next check that that ’ s where he was about to put it .</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: How can you still believe she’s
innocent?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You’re going to trust the word of a woman who
named her child after a condiment? She’s ly-ing.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: And you know this for a fact?</p>
<p><strong>’ elle</strong>: Did you see the icky black color of her
hair?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I never trust a woman who’s not blonde. Except
for my friend Serena, but that’s only because she’s a blonde at heart.
That’s the whole reason I ’ m starting the Blonde Legal Defense
Fund.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Blondes are discriminated against worldwide!
Brooke’s a blonde, and people are saying she’s sleeping with the cheesy
pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would
be, “Oh, the poor widow.”</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You’re serious?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You should see the way I ’ m treated in class!
I’m a complete source of mockery. This is why the Blonde Legal Defense
Fund is needed.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Okay, how would it work?</p>
<p><strong>e lle</strong>: It would be a full-service law firm, by and
for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community
outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it – name one blonde
intellectual role model.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: – I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: That is a direct result of anti- blonde
discrimination!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Wait – Hilary Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: If she were a true blonde, she would’ve left
the cheating bastard. Blondes don’t let their husbands get fellated by
brunettes and live to tell about it.</p>
<p><strong>emm e t t</strong>: . In that case, maybe Heyworth got —</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a
sixty-year-old man can take? �.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: That’s not really a topic that keeps me up
at night – but maybe it should.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Speaking of that �– I bought you some seaweed
cream while we were at the spa.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: What the hell is that for?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: The bags under your eyes. You’re an attractive
man, but you need to take better care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I don’t – Do that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Well, you should –. I f you look good, you �
feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Projecting joy is not my job.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You really think I ’ m attractive?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: For a butt-head? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>- dorky david</strong>: So – I called your room last
night.</p>
<p><strong>freshman girl</strong>: ’</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: I was thinking maybe we could go out
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>freshman girl</strong>: Uh, n o . . . you’re a dork.</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: I ’ m in law school –</p>
<p><strong>freshman girl</strong>: Look – I ’ m not going out with you.
I can’t believe you’d even ask. Girls like me don’t go out with losers
like you.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Why didn’t you call me?</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: We spend a beautiful night together and then I
never hear from you again?</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: I – uh –</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: F or what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex
for me with any other man?</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: U h – both?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Forget it. I’ve already spent too many hours
crying over you.</p>
<p><strong>freshman girl</strong>: So, urn, when did you wanna go
out?</p>
<p><strong>another girl</strong>: I ’ m free on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>d a joyce rafferty</strong>: A nd what was the defendant
doing?</p>
<p><strong>m r s. windham vandermark</strong>: S it ti n g next to the
pool topless, while th e Latin boy handed her a drink.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. courtroom - day 103</strong>: DA Rafferty continues

<p><strong>da joyce rafferty</strong>: A n d where was she exactly?</p>

<p><strong>da joyce rafferty</strong>: This is the uniform that
Mrs. Windham asked you to wear while cleaning her pool?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>da joyce rafferty</strong>: And are you or are you not,
having an affair with Brooke Windham?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Define affair.</p>
<p><strong>da joyce rafferty</strong>: Have you inserted your genitalia
into hers?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Objection –</p>
<p><strong>da joyce rafferty</strong>: Have you and Mrs. Windham had
sexual relations?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Y es! Okay? Yes!</p>
<p><strong>105 int. courtroom - moments later 105</strong>: Everyone
files out. As Brooke is being led away, she turns to Elle.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I’m not having an affair with Enrique – you
know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I
just liked watching him bend over to clean the f i lt e r –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I believe you! Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You done with that yet?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Take it. I’ve read it twenty times.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I believe her, too. I don’t think she’s
having an affair with Enrique.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Too bad you and I are the only ones.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I ’ m still can’t believe you didn’t tell
Donovan the alibi.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: It’s not my alibi to tell –</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know. I thought that was very – classy of
you. .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Really? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: y Have you ever noticed that Donovan
never</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Men are helpless. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Warner can’t even do his own laundry.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I know. He has it sent out.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You’re kidding!</p>
<p><strong>margot and serena</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Oh, my God! ’ -.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What’re you doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: We’re on our way to the bridal show in New
York so we thought we’d rescue you from law school for the night.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: We have a limo downstairs and lots more of
these.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You guys – I can’t. We’re in the middle of a
trial.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Where’s Warner?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: At the office ~</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy
girl.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Margot!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Bring her, too. C’mon. You can wear one of
Elle’s outfits.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: T ha t ’ s okay –</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Speaking of which, can you please put on
some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky
and dragged you through a K-Mart.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I can’t believe you guys are actually here –
but this case is important. I’ll make it up to you after finals, okay?
I</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Okay. . . Call us if you change your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Jesus. Talk about a Rock. You must be better
in bed than you look.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’ll call you as soon as it’s over, okay?
Sisters forever?</p>
<p><strong>margot and serena</strong>: Sister forever.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Save it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’ll drink it after we win.</p>

nail polish display by the door.</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: I’ve got a big one for you.</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: Can you sign?</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: Got it?</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>108 int. courthouse - hallway - day 108</strong>: Elle waits
in line for the water fountain, talking on her cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You broke his nose?!</p>
<p><strong>ups guy</strong>: I ’m okay –</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: I think he noticed me, Elle – But only
because I maimed him!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’ll be over right after the trial, okay?
We’re about to cross- examine Enrique. And don’t worry! My friend Serena
barfed on a guy during “The Blair Witch Project” and end up dating him
for three months.</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Don’t stomp your little Prada sandals at
me, Miss Thing.</p>
<p><strong>109 int. courtroom - day - moments later 109</strong>: Elle
grabs Emmett’s arm as he whispers with Donovan.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: He’s gay! Enrique is gay!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Warner, what kind of shoes do I have on?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Pink ones.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: He’s gay – he isn’t Brooke’s lover! He’s
making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Back up. How do you know he’s gay?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Gay men know designers. Straight men
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Enrique’s gay. I ’ m sure of it.’</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house
once –</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: While I appreciate your masterful legal
theory, I have a murder trial to attend to.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thanks for the backup.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: How was I supposed to know what kind of
shoes you had on?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that
you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Just the love in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: If that’s all the proof that he has, your
Honor, I think I’m done here.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I have a couple of questions, Your
Honor?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Give me two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a
date?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would
recognize us.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: And how long have you been sleeping with
Mrs. Windham?</p>
<p><strong>. enrique</strong>: Three months.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: And what is your boyfriend’s name?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: I ’ m sorry, I misunderstood. Chuck is just
a friend.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: If I ’ m just your friend, why have we been
doing the slippy-slap every night for the past six months?</p>
<p><strong>111 ext. courthouse - day 111</strong>: Elle and Emmett walk
down the stairs together in high spirits. Donovan catches up.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Good work today, Ms. Woods.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: And after they set his nose, he came back
for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on
pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was
unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m so happy for you!</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: How’d it go at the trial?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Great. Donovan actually said the words “Good
work, Ms. Woods”. He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Of course I can believe it. You’re going
to make a great lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: Elle, you’ve changed my life. You are the
kindest, most wonderful angel. Without you, I wouldn’t have Rufus or a
dinner date. Now go and share your goodness with the world while I stay
here and have my hoo-hoo waxed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Donovan asked to see you before you � ’
leave.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s already got his coffee – maybe he needs
a donut.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You followed your intuition today and you
listened.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Ab ou t the alibi –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I ’ m sorry, but –</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I ’ m impressed that you took the
initiative to go there and get it. That’s what makes a good lawyer. And
on top of that, you gained the client’s trust and kept it.. That’ s what
makes a great lawyer. You’re smart, Elle. Smarter than �� . most of the
guys I have on my payroll.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Wow. That means so much to me to hear you say
that.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I think it’s time discuss your career path.
Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Not really. I know how competitive it . �. a l
l is –</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You know what competition is really about,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: It’s about ferocity. Carnage.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Balancing human intelligence with animal
diligence. Knowing exactly what you want and how far you’ll go to get
it. How far will Elle go?</p>
<p><strong>115 outside donovan’s office 115</strong>: Sarah walks down
the hallway, glancing in Donovan’s office to see –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You’re hitting on me?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You’re a beautiful girl, Elle.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So everything you just said –?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I ’ m a man who knows what I want.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And I ’ m a law student who’s finally realized
her professor is a pathetic asshole.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Too bad. I thought you were a law student
who wanted to be a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You almost had me fooled.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Maybe you should sleep with the judge too.
Then we can win the case.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: He y –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’m quitting.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Whoa – Why?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Law school was a mistake. Getting this
internship was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: What’re you talking about? You earned
it-</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I didn’t earn anything. I got this internship
because Donovan liked the way I looked. Which he made clear .tonight
when he tried to feel me up.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: So now you’re –?</p>
<p><strong>. elle</strong>: Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my
destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more
navy blue suits. No more panty-hose. No more trying to be something I ’
m not.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: What if you’re trying to be something you
are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thanks for not treating me the way everyone
else here does. Call me if you’re ever in California.</p>
<p><strong>paulette</strong>: You can’t go home!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What’s the point of staying? All people see
when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one’s ever going
to take me seriously. The people at law s chool don’t, Warner doesn’t –
I don’t even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow
up and become a Victoria’s Secret model who marries a rock star. Now,
for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something
better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding
mys elf – Donovan didn’t see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of
ass.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a
j oke.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: The hell with law school. I just came to say
goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>professor stromwell</strong>: If you let one stupid prick
ruin your life, you’re not the girl I thought you were.</p>
<p><strong>donovan on tv</strong>: Enrique Salvatore has been
discredited as a witness.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2 on tv</strong>: Did you go in there knowing how
you were going to discredit Mr. Salvatore?</p>
<p><strong>donovan on tv</strong>: Absolutely. It’s a little thing I
like to call strategy.</p>
<p><strong>in the waiting room</strong>: Brooke looks away from the TV.
Emmett is next to her, prepping her for the following day.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Is he always such an ass?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: He’s the top defense attorney in the state.
Of course he’s an ass.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: He’s an ass that’s gonna try.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: He thinks I ’ m guilty, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: That’s not what’s important.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: To me it is. He doesn’t trust me. Why should
I trust him?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You’re right. Why should you?</p>
<p><strong>122 ext. courthouse - day 122</strong>: People enter.
Reporters set up their cameras. Dorky David passes by in a suit and
tie.</p>
<p><strong>123 int. courthouse - hallway - day 123</strong>: Donovan and
Emmett head into the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Keep that bitch away from me.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: She’s our client.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Not Brooke. Elle.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Funny how a woman can turn into a bitch just
by saying “no”.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What’re you so happy about? You’re on trial
for murder.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: You’re fired. I have new representation.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>’ elle</strong>: Excuse you. You’re in my way.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: She’s a law student. She can’t defend
you.</p>
<p><strong>dorky david</strong>: Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
Rule .</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Counselors, approach the bench.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You’re not going up there.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I don’t think you heard me. You’re fired.
She’s my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Counselors, now. All of you.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Elle Woods, your honor. Rule 3:03 of the
Supreme Judicial Court states that a law � student may appear on behalf
of a defendant in criminal proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>da joyce rafferty</strong>: I have no problem with this.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I do. I’m not allowing it.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But you agreed last night. In the office? When
we were discussing my “career”?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The ruling also states that you need a
licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. Donovan?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: That, I won’t agree to.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I ’ m supervising, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Well, then, Ms. Woods. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>in the audience</strong>: Paulette beams, the UPS Guy in the
nose brace, next to her.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Go, Elle!</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Enjoy prison.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Don’t fuck with a Delta Gamma.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Kick some butt.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Ms. Woods, call your first witness.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’d like to recall Chutney Windham as a
defense witness.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Ms. Woods, begin your questioning.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: First, your Honor, I ’ d like to point out
that not only is there no proof in this case, but there’s a complete
lack of mens rea, which by definition tells us that there is no crime
without a vicious will.</p>
<p><strong>judge �</strong>: I am aware of the meaning of mens rea. What
I am unaware of is why you’re giving me a vocabulary lesson instead of
questioning your witness.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Okay – Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back
at the house? Was your father there?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Not that I saw. But like I said, I went
straight upstairs to take a shower. ’ ,</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And when you came downstairs, what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: I saw Brooke standing over his body,
drenched in his blood.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But Mrs. Windham didn’t have a gun?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: No, she’d stashed it by then.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Move to strike that from the record, your
Honor. Speculation.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Stricken.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Did you hear a shot fired?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: No. I was in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So at some point in the – twenty minutes? –
you were in the shower, your father was shot?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Your father was shot while you were in the
shower?</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: Where’s she going with this?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Have a little faith.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But you didn’t hear the shot, because you were
in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Yes. I was washing my hair.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Miss Windham, can you tell us what you’d been
doing earlier in the day?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the
gym, got a perm, and came home.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Where you got in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I believe the witness has made it clear that
she was in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a . .
perm before, Miss Windham?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: How many, would you say?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Two a year since I was twelve. You do the
math.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy
Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to ~ curls
really weren’t the right look for her – She didn’t have your bone
structure.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: But, thankfully, that same day, she entered
the Pi Kap wet t-shirt contest where she was completely hosed down from
head to toe.</p>
<p><strong>da joyce rafferty</strong>: Objection. Why is this
relevant?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I have a point. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Then make it.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko’s curls
were ruined when she got hosed down?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Because they got wet.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: That’s right. Because isn’t the first cardinal
rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at
least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of
de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And wouldn’t someone who’s had – thirty perms
? – throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And if you, in fact, were not washing your
hair, as I suspect you were not, since your curls are still intact,
wouldn’t you have heard the gunshot?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then
Brooke Windham wouldn’t have had time to hide the gun before you got
downstairs. Which would mean that you would’ve had to have found
Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible.
Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: She’s younger than I am. Did she tell you
that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than
you?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn’t
you, Chutney? After you shot your father?</p>
<p><strong>chutney</strong>: I didn’t mean to shoot him – � I meant to
shoot you!</p>
<p><strong>brooke .’..’</strong>: I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Oh, my G^d.! !</p>
<p><strong>126 int. courthouse foyer - day 126</strong>: Reporters mob
Elle and Brooke as they make their way out of the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Elle, how did you know Chutney was
lying?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Because she is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: The rules of haircare are simple and finite .
Any Cosmo girl would ’ ve known .</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What the –?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Honey, stop! Bile’s on TV!</p>
<p><strong>sapphire</strong>: Oh, my God! What happened to her tan?
’</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: I wish we could stay longer, but I have a
game.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I can’t believe you’re a Laker Girl!</p>
<p><strong>margot</strong>: Hello! You’re like, a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Even though you knew your shit today – you’re
still a product of the patriarchy and a creation of the male-dominated
media. And so are your friends.</p>
<p><strong>enid</strong>: Although – you’re kinda hot. Call me.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Don’t worry. She’s harmless. I’ll see you guys
soon! Thanks for coming!</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: You were amazing today.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: It made me realize something. I ’ m an
idiot.</p>
<p><strong>elle .</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I want to be with you, Elle. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>elle . ’</strong>: I want to be with you, too, Warner.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: In court. On opposing sides.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Are you serious? �</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.</p>
<p><strong>warner .</strong>: Sarah – hold on. .</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: El le , wait up –</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I ’ m a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And Donovan’s a-scumbag for coming on to
you.</p>
<p><strong>’ elle</strong>: Yes, he is. � .</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So – can we drink that champagne when I get
back from the pawnshop?</p>
<p><strong>elle .. .</strong>: You’re pawning The Rock?!</p>
<p><strong>sarah �</strong>: Hell, yes. We’ve got finals to study for.
In Jamaica.</p>
<p><strong>emmett �</strong>: Up for a celebration dinner?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Are you asking me on a date?</p>
<p><strong>emmett -</strong>: As long as you realize I’m not just some
man-toy you can show off like a trophy.</p>
<p><strong>elle ’</strong>: Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early
class tomorrow. .</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: So Friday at eight?</p>
