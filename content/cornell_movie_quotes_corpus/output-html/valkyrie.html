<h1 id="valkyrie">valkyrie</h1>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: My comrades. Once again - I don’t know how
many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life. I
speak to you tonight for two reasons. First, so that you can hear my
voice and know that I am unhurt. And second, so that you may know the
details of a crime without parallel in German history…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s not so much your car he doesn’t trust…
It’s your driver.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Seated further down the table are Tresckow
and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt, eating like a pig,
still making notes in his book. Tresckow stares.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Managing the F�hrer’s security must be
quite an undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: Irregularity is the F�hrer’s precaution of
choice.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I can assure you he’s safe here. Relax,
Brandt. Enjoy your meal.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I understand you’re returning to Berlin
this afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Could I trouble you to deliver a package
to Colonel Stieff?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Tresckow presses a key against the side of
the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The explosive armed now,
he hands it to Brandt.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: With my regards to Colonel Stieff.</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: Cointreau? You better hope I don’t get
thirsty on the flight.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: He’s… landed.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: What about the…</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Get me Colonel Brandt… Colonel? Tresckow…
I trust you landed safely… I hate to trouble you but there’s been a bit
of a mix up. It seems you have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stieff.
You… do still have the package?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up. Terribly sorry for the inconvenience…
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Do you think he knows?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: There’s only one way to be sure…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I can only guess the altitude caused the
fuse to malfunction. First the beer hall, Memorial Day - now this.
Someone is watching over that sonofabitch, I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: We’ve been discovered.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: What makes you think-</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Oster’s been arrested. The Gestapo came
for him last night.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: The Gestapo could have arrested him for
anything. Find a replacement.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: There’s no one we can trust. Not in
Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Then stop looking in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Your pistol please.</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: You’ll forgive me, General. This little
round-up has had me writing reports all day.</p>
<p><strong>treskow</strong>: Round-up?</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: Dissenters. A plot against the F�hrer.</p>
<p><strong>treskow</strong>: Who would even have the balls?</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: You’d be surprised, the number of cowards in
this army that would be willing to stand against the Reich.</p>
<p><strong>treskow</strong>: Only if the F�hrer were dead, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: Of course. It’s one thing to think you know
what’s right. What matters is having the strength to do it.</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: Is this what you’ve come for?</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: Perhaps we should open it.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: You’ve come a long way. You must be
thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I wonder how the F�hrer, who does not
partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty… Colonel
Brandt.</p>
<p><strong>brandt</strong>: I took you for another sort, General.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: And I you.</p>
<p><strong>young lieutenant</strong>: Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new
headquarters has been established at Mezzouna. I’m to take you
there.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Now they tell us to disengage - a day
late. No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always
manage to leave us-</p>
<p><strong>young lieutenant</strong>: Colonel, the enemy is less than
five kilometers from here. You’ve done all you can.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I wonder… Was there even a point in
our coming to Tunis?</p>
<p><strong>young lieutenant</strong>: To get taken prisoner, it
seems.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mrs. Stauffenberg?</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: The Colonel’s brother, Berthold.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should
go to my office and-</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: I will see my husband now.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s been constant with fever but he refuses
any pain killers. The right hand has been amputated above the wrist.
He’s lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. We… couldn’t save
the left eye.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: His ring.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I don’t-</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: He had a ring on his right hand. Where is
it?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m sorry… His hand was amputated in the
field… I’m afraid-</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The engraving inside the band - finis-
initium . Nina places the ring and chain on her husband’s chest, her
hand lingering. She cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands
and turns away, not wanting her husband to see.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: We’ve lost North Africa.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: That one eye staring at us closes.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I don’t know what I ever did with
ten.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m wanted in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Are you asking as a member of the High
Command?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You can speak openly, General. He died
just before you came in.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: We could use your help.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m a field officer.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: This war can’t be won in the field.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: That’s unfortunate for me.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: You can’t honestly believe you’ll make a
difference on the front-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m a soldier, General. I serve my
country.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: It makes no sense. You opposed Hitler, you
opposed the war.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: The people chose otherwise and here we
are. Now we have to win. You know what will happen if we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: If we win, it will still be Hitler’s
Germany.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We all took an oath, General.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: On behalf of the F�hrer.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m a twin, you know.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I… I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: My brother died the day after we were
born.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I was lying in the desert, covered in
blood, sure I was going to die. I tried to think about my wife, my
children… But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother. How I would
finally be with him. How I would finally be whole again…</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: This is my reward for what happened to
my men. It’s all I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A field of white. A three fingered hand
enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to the one just
saw.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Stauffenberg, done up in his
finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an unconscious WOUNDED
SOLDIER.</p>
<p><strong>pull back further to reveal</strong>: Stauffenberg stands
between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED SOLDIER. Those that
can respond to Stauffenberg do so with reverence. The ward is eerily
silent.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Stauffenberg’s face - the reality of
Africa taking the wind out of him. Over this we hear a familiar clicking
of heels and:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Colonel… COLONEL.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I don’t want the damn th-</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: When will you be going back to the
front?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m not going to the front. I’m needed
in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>witzleben</strong>: …He is not a man, he’s a lunatic. He
doesn’t drink, he doesn’t fuck. He has no weakness to exploit, no vice
to manipulate. His only passion is complete control. How can you expect
to reason with him?</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: After this most recent failure I’d say
we’ve no other choice.</p>
<p><strong>witzleben</strong>: Confront Hitler now and you’ll end up
with piano wire for a neck-tie. Our only option is the central
solution.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: He’s a man like any other. Flesh and
blood. Take him head on and-</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I’ll say this for you, Doctor… You’re
certainly delusional enough to take Hitler’s place.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: When that day comes, I’ll be sure to
remember you.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I doubt you’ll remember much of
anything.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: Dammit, Tresckow-</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Gentlemen, may I present Colonel
Stauffenberg. He’s been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry.
Colonel, may I introduce-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: These men need no introduction.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I apologize for this unfortunate… spectacle.
On behalf of everyone, welc-</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: I haven’t welcomed him. Not yet. Where
does he stand?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: For God’s sake-</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: He’s a field officer. He knows the army
better than any of us. I want to hear his opinion.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: All right. What do you think, Colonel?
Confront Hitler, force him to resign? Or the central solution?</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: “Central Solution.” You soldiers are all
the same. Say what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>witzleben</strong>: That’s a laugh coming from a
politician.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: The army will follow diplomats before
they follow assassins.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: They follow a butcher now. What difference
does it-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: What makes you think the army will
follow you at all?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Oust him, kill him. That isn’t what
matters. How do you plan to take control of the government when Hitler
is gone?</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: I beg your pardon, Colonel, but you are
in the presence of men who would have been Hitler’s inner circle.
Instead we resigned. We put our principles above personal gain.</p>
<p><strong>witzleben</strong>: We have the have the respect of the
people. And the army.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: With all respect, sir, you put too
much faith in your popularity. All of you do.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: Now see here, Colonel-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You said yourself, I’m a field
officer. You all may understand government, but I know the men. A great
many of them may hate Hitler, but they all fear him - they fear Himmler,
Goebbels, the whole of the Reich. That kind of fear won’t just die with
Hitler. And as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one
thing. Authority. And if just one man questions that authority, you can
lose them all. They were fooled into following Hitler… How will you fool
them - force them - into following you?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: What are you doing here? I thought I
left you in Bamberg. It’s a wonderful surprise. Thank you, brother.</p>
<p><strong>mama, come down. papa is here. papa</strong>: IS HERE.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: What do you mean you quit?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I came to join the Resistance, not
some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: Beck is a just and capable man. As for
Goerdeler, well, he’s popular. He’ll make a good Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately I
have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: You can’t blame the people for this. You
have to see the beginning of something to know how it’ll end. It’s no
different than a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it’s over his
head.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Plenty of people thought-</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: The greatest offenders are not the ones
who thought better but the ones who sensed better.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: I seem to remember you telling me about
reports from the Ukraine - the SS forcing Jews to dig their own graves.
You said then that Hitler should be removed. An officer’s duty, you
said. What’s changed?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I said senior officers. The only men
that can get to him.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: Perhaps it doesn’t matter that you
succeed.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: Perhaps it only matters that you try.
Don’t you see? Someone has to stand up and show the world that not all
of us were like him.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Even if they could remove Hitler, they
can’t hope to seize power. For God’s sake, they have no plan.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: Then give them one. Find a way.</p>
<p><strong>berthold</strong>: Evil happens when good men do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Children, that is far too-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Air-raid.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: We’ve already considered Valkyrie. It
isn’t suitable.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Not as it’s currently written.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Operation Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: The Reserve Army has thousands of men all
over the city - most of them not even in uniform. Valkyrie is top secret
plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Hitler designed it himself to crush
any internal unrest if he’s cut off or killed.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: And what use is that to us?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: The orders could be rewritten. A few
subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our
command.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Yes, of course, but-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Now what would the High Command do if
they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: They would declare a military state of
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: And initiate Operation Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Hitler’s own Reserve Army, using
Hitler’s own plan and under our command, would automatically seize power
in Berlin…</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: While we put a new government in
place.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Precisely. It will seem as though
we’re fighting for Hitler Government, not against it.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: But only if Hitler’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: That is what you’re saying, isn’t it? The
central solution.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: How else will you make people believe the
SS is trying to seize power?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m afraid it’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: I’m disappointed in you, Colonel. I
thought a man of your background would appreciate a more-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m a soldier first, an aristocrat
second.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: Yes, but-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: And you’re neither, Doctor. Now if you
want to be Chancellor, you’ll do as you’re told.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Can this plan be made to work?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Rewriting the order is one thing -
distributing it is another. A bomb can be disarmed, recovered if it
fails. In this case we’d be willfully circulating written evidence of
high treason. It’s the best idea we’ve heard yet.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: There is one… small problem.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Fromm…</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: Who is Fromm?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Commander of the Home Army. Olbricht can
put the reserve troops on alert, but only Fromm can actually initiate
Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Can we get to him?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: He’s a careerist pig.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: But one who’s gone as high as he can
go in Hitler’s Army. It’s no secret he’s not happy about it.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Perhaps if we offered him a key position
in the new regime he could be made to see the light.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We don’t seem to have a choice. Without Fromm
there is no Valkyrie. Get him.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Stauffenberg and Olbricht
waiting patiently, sitting across from:</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: You’re a woman, Fromm. And a fat one at
that. I’d have you sent to the front if I didn’t think you’d surrender
just to be Montgomery’s whore.</p>
<p><strong>herber</strong>: The… General will see you now.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Well, Olbricht? Speak up.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I wanted to introduce you to our new man -
Colonel Stauffenberg.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I’d offer my
hand but you might not give it back.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’d say the General’s lost more
important things this morning.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: About time they put a man with balls in this
office. Have a seat. You too, if you must.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: They tell me you’re critical of the war,
Colonel. Not that you don’t seem to have good reason.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I am critical of losing the war,
General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: In the field, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: In Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: I take it that’s why you’re here. To make
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’ve made my decision, General. I`m
here to help others make theirs.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: They say when there’s no clear option, one
should do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We’re at war. We must act. Sometimes…
rashly.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Just what sort of rash action did you have in
mind, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: That would be a decision for the
Supreme Military Commander.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Supreme Commander, you say.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Second only to the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: If only I were that man… This war would be
going quite differently.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: We were thinking the very same thing.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: I don’t need to remind you that we’ve all
sworn an oath. That said, I’m going to forget we had this conversation
with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof
again. Am I clear?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg/olbricht</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Tell your friends that I always come down on
the right side. And as long as the F�hrer is alive, you know what side
that is.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I think that went rather well.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Yes… Quite.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Were you followed?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me half
to death.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We’ll be closer than that before we’re
finished.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Looking this over, I’m not satisfied that
the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Yes, I’ve been giving that some
thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’ve also drawn up an outline for
orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate
forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but
also the radio and newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Combat groups will be reorganized as
reinforced grenadier regiments. One or two of them can be quickly
mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag. We blitz the government
quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all SS and
police barracks. Any officers who resist will be arrested… or shot.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: If anyone comes to you, play ignorant.
Just tell them-</p>
<p><strong>fraulein oven</strong>: I’ll tell that I was serving the
German people. Then I’ll tell them to go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: To Operation Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I’ve been transferred to the front.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: Would you have stayed?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Do you think Fromm reported us?</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: It’s more likely just… an unfortunate
coincidence. Anyway it doesn’t matter. You wrote the orders. You know
them better than anyone.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You don’t mean to say-</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I’m appointing you military leader of the
Resistance. Beck agrees.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: But Olbricht-</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: We both know Olbricht hasn’t the wit or
the spine. No. It’s you.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: One more thing. You were right what you
said that first night. It’s not enough to kill Hitler. We need to
isolate his chain of command. The slightest confusion could crush us. We
need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the
flash.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: That greatly limits our options of
where and when to make our move, but it’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: How will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Perhaps it’s better I don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: God promised Abraham that he would not
destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men.</p>
<p><strong>tresckow</strong>: I have a feeling that for Germany it may
come down to one.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Fellgiebel’s smile suddenly fades. He
looks into his glass, his good mood vanishing. He politely excuses
himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and heads for the bathroom. He
looks ill.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Mingling among the melting chunks of ice
is a GLASS EYE staring back at him.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: You realize how close I am to Hitler.
With one word I could have the Gestapo make you disappear.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Why haven’t you then?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: None of my associates know we’ve been
talking if that’s what you’re afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: But you know. And when the SS catch you,
they’ll pull you apart like warm bread. It’ll be a crime just to have
known you then. I warn you. If it means protecting myself, I will expose
you. Do not try to contact me again.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You can’t report me. Maybe if you had
when I first approached you, you’d have been keeping your oath. But now
you’re just as guilty as-</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: So you think that makes me a
sympathizer, eh? You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer
or his F�hrer and assume his actions will show you his heart. It’s not
that simple.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: It is to me.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: For the last time, don’t push me to make
a decision.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I have no choice. It’s clear now that
without you we have no hope of success.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You want us to succeed. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: And what if you do, eh? What then? Will
you be any different from Hitler? What of his Reich, his people, the
very momentum of history? Will all of that let you be something he
isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: But my pregnant wife, our four
children, the Germany I first swore to defend… They demand that I be
something different. They demand that I fight for their future even if
it means…</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Even if it means that I never see them
again.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Action is inevitable. As are the
consequences. When they come for me I’ll do what I can to hide what you
knew and when you knew it. But don’t delude yourself. You were involved
in a crime against your country long before you met me. There’s still
time to redeem yourself. Only God can judge you now.</p>
<p><strong>drunken officer</strong>: Are you two finished or just
getting started?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Leave us, please.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: You play the part of bureaucrat
beautifully.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: It’s the only time I can relax.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: There’s a man here to interview as your
adjutant.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Adjut- What for?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: No one told you? You’ve been promoted
Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: For Christ’s sake. Don’t I have enough
to do?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Unfortunately, your nocturnal activities
don’t count as service to the Reich.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’ll refuse the promotion.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: You’ll do no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Dammit, I can’t handle the work I
already-</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: This is an opportunity we could never have
dreamed of. You’re in the inner circle now - with genuine access to
Hitler, his advisors, his schedule… We need this.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We’re not ready. We’re moving too
fast.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Not half as fast as the Allies. An
invasion is coming, Colonel. Any day now. We must act and we must act
soon.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Tresckow may have left you in charge of
the “central solution,” but in this world I still outrank you. You will
accept the appointment. Is that understood?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Now. The new man is waiting outside. He
comes highly recommended. He might even be an ideal candidate.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: We still need an assassin.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Be seated.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Do you know how this war will end,
Haeften? The portrait will be un- hung… And the man will be hung.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Bottom line. I’m engaged in high
treason with all means available to me. Can I count you in?</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: For anything, sir. Anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Anything is a very dangerous word.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: The Allied Forces have blundered into
the trap awaiting them on the beaches of Normandy - heroically repelled
by the combined might of the German Army. It is a glorious day for the
Reich. At long last the craven enemy has come to Europe to face their
inevitable defeat at the hands of-</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: Five thousand ships, one-hundred thousand
men from the combined Allied forces.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: What about the Panzer divisions
in-</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: They were never dispatched. Word is Hitler
took a sleeping pill. His staff was afraid to wake him.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: First Africa, now France.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: The Russians bearing down from the
East.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Sometimes I wonder if Hitler’s real
aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe
he’ll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still
can.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We’ll see if I can’t convince him.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You don’t need to search him.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Fromm’s adjutant, Lt. Herber approaches,
waving off the SS.</p>
<p><strong>herber</strong>: Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest.
The hero of Africa.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: For God’s sake, Stauffenberg, you’re-</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: … they’re waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Mein F�hrer… I wish to present Colonel Claus
von Stauffenberg - our new Chief of General Staff for the Replacement
Army.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: May I say, I am honored to meet a hero who
has sacrificed so much for Germany. If only more of my officers were
like you.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Let this man stand as an example to all of
you. He is the ideal German officer.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Mein F�hrer, we have asked Stauffenberg here
today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the Home Army
to support those in Normandy.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will no longer
be necessary. General Goering has assured me that Normandy is under
control.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Mein F�hrer, if I may… The situation
in Normandy is-</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: You’re dismissed, Stauffenberg.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: But-</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Send your man home, Fromm. Then bring us
some brandy.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: I don’t know what you’ve got brewing and I
don’t want to know… But when the music stops, I’d be much obliged if
Keitel should find himself without a chair.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: They’re all insane. Every one of them
except for Speer, and he’s nothing but an architect.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Tell Beck we’ve found our assassin…
I’ll do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Out of the question. It won’t work. We need
you here in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Who else, then? Who can even get as
close?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Valkyrie is very clear. Once the order
is given, the Reserve Army will automatically seize control of the
government with or without me.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Orders are not enough. They need a man to
follow. The right man.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Olbricht will oversee operations in my
absence. I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is-</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Three very crucial hours.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We both know there’s no other way.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’ll tell the others-</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’m afraid whatever the outcome, I won’t be
there to see it.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Nonsense. You’re stronger than you
think. You might just be the strongest one of all.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: …After that I thought I’d take the children to
the country for a few days to see my- Claus?</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Have you heard a word I said?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: The country… Nina. Listen. I want you
to delay your trip. Just for a while.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Does this have something to do with… your
work?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I would just be more comfortable
knowing where you are - until I’m back from Berlin. Things will be
different then. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: How long until… until we see you?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: A few days. If all goes well. Then we
can travel as a family.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: And if things… don’t go well?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I love you, Nina.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: And I love you… What-</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Go be with your children.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Two 975 gram packs of plastic-W. Enough
explosive to cripple a panzer. Your detonators. Your fuses. British time
pencils. This acid capsule is your trigger.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: When you’re ready to arm, attach the
detonator to the bottom of the time pencil, like so… …Insert the entire
device into either end of the plastic-W, crush the acid capsule and
you’re live. When the acid eats through the wire holding back the
trigger spring… Well… You’ll want to be very far away.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: What if they search your bag?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’m one of the inner circle now.
They’ll make sure I am who I am. Beyond that, they won’t touch me. How
much time do I have?</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Theoretically there’s a 30-minute delay. But
with the kind of heat you can expect at the Wolf’s Lair, I’d give you
10, 15 minutes tops.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: That’s… hardly precise.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: This is state of the art. You can have small
or precise. Not both.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Might this be just a little too small?</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: The explosion won’t do the killing. The air
in the room will.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Hitler’s bunker is constructed of reenforced
concrete. A steel door, no windows. Just one of these explosives in a
space like that will cause tremendous air pressure.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Enough to instantly kill everyone present.
The second charge will be entirely redundant.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Of course, I’m all for redundancy.
However… If, by some miracle, Hitler does survive, what then?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We have an inside man at the Wolf’s
Lair in communications. He’ll notify you immediately following the flash
and then sever all contact with the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Just how did you manage that?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: It’s my job, isn’t it? While Hitler’s
inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize
control in Paris and Berlin. Even if Hitler survives, we’ll have
momentum.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: But as you said yourself it would take a
miracle. Anyone in that bunker when just one of these goes off is not
coming out alive.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Himmler is expected to be at the meeting
as well. Don’t proceed unless you can get them both.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: That could be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Why kill a madman just to have a lunatic
take his place?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: This is Goerdeler’s idea, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: The members are in total agreement on
this.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Fucking politicians. I’ll hold off if
the decision is unanimous. And I want another man on the committee. A
soldier.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: And just who this soldier be?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: This is General Olbricht. Order the Guard
Battalion and all Army Schools near Berlin to take up march readiness.
Stand by for Operation Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: One teletype in particular. The words are
clicking by quickly but we clearly make out:</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: This order is calling the Reserve Army for
some sort of stand-by action… in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: Looks like a drill of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: Valkyrie? I’ve never heard of that.</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: Send the order through, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>close on the berlin commandant - general paul von</strong>:
HASE - issuing the alert signal. AIR SIRENS wail.</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: What do you suppose this is all about?</p>
<p><strong>hagen</strong>: Probably just a drill.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Drive on.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: Your man?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Himmler. Where is Himmler?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: …Now for the first order of business. Fromm,
I believe you will brief us on blocking divisions for the Eastern
Front…</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: General Olbricht’s Office. Hold the line.
Stauffenberg says Himmler’s not at the briefing. He wants to
proceed.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Call Beck.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Beck.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Himmler is not in the briefing.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: They say no. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: I say do it.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The spot where Stauffenberg left his
briefcase. Remember? Well it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: My briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: …Gentleman. You are dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: That call better have been important.</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Your bag… Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>hase</strong>: What the hell is going on? My men have been
standing here for an hour. I don’t know what to tell them.</p>
<p><strong>hase</strong>: At ease, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: This has been a drill. You’re all to be
commended for your quick response. Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>hagen</strong>: What did I tell you? A drill.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making
note of the esteemed KNIGHT’S CROSS pinned to Remer’s uniform. Olbricht
leans toward Hase.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: That man there. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>hase</strong>: Major Remer? He commands the Deutschland Guard
Battalion. What about him?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>hase</strong>: Remer? Don’t worry about him. He’s an order
taker. To the bone.</p>
<p><strong>herber</strong>: The General will see you now.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby
without my knowledge. You damn near cost me my commission. What in God’s
name made you think you even had the authority?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: It was only a drill. An exercise.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: DON’T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We both know
it was no fucking drill.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: General, if I may-</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: You may not, Colonel. You may not do
anything. Because now you’ve not only shown me you can’t deliver, you’ve
painted a target on my back. If I so much as sense you trying to move
the Reserve Army again, I’ll personally have you both arrested. Do I
make myself abundantly clear?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg/olbricht</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: I’ll hear you say it, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: The point of your central solution is to
replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies. The
Allies, I suspect, would be more amenable to a truce… IF WE</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Today was a matter of indecision -
nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: I don’t think I am alone when I say your
judgement is in question. I would like to take a vote.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Carl.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Carl, if I may have a word with you in
private.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: If you have something to say, Ludwig, say
it here. Say it now.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Very well. There’s no need to vote.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I consider you a friend. And I look forward to
the day when we can once again live as free men. But you’ve become a
liability.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’m sorry it has to be this way.</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: Wha… What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Fellgiebel informed me this evening… Himmler’s
issued an order for your arrest. You’ll have to leave Germany. Tonight.
When we’ve succeeded with the central solution you’ll return as
Chancellor. Until then-</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: This is your doing, isn’t it? ISN’T IT?
You can’t just get rid of me like this. I am the man Germany will
follow. I’m… I…</p>
<p><strong>goerdeler</strong>: Ludwig, I-</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No more indecision. From now on, Stauffenberg
has discretion.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I can’t issue Valkyrie again unless we
follow through. If he fails to-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’ll do my job. You just take
Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A telephone. Stauffenberg’s three fingered
hand picks up the receiver and lifts it out of frame.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’d like to place a call to Bamberg,
please.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The silent telephone in the foreground. We
wait for it to ring, but it never does.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Have you made your peace with God, then?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: As best I can.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Then you have nothing to fear.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I know the soldier inside me is a
traitor. I wonder how I’ll be judged as a man.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: By history?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: By God.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: In the end, we answer only to ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Did you reach your wife?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Bombing in Ebingen. I can’t get
through.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg. They’re
safe. You’ve seen to that. To think… You came to us a wounded soldier
from Africa. Now… Now you are both the architect and the assassin. I’m
still trying to understand how this came to be.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Like a farmer watching the corn grow.
One day it’s over his head…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Nothing…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The box that holds his glass eye,
staring.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: His crisp white collar, picking up a trace
of blood from the cut on his throat.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Gentlemen, may I introduce Chief Helldorf.
He’s guaranteed the full support of the Berlin Police.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We can begin.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Hitler has scheduled a military briefing for
today at one o’clock. Stauffenberg will strike regardless of who else is
present.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Once in position, he will signal us once to
alert the troops and again after the flash…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Assuming Fromm refuses to join us, Olbricht
will take Command of the Reserve Army and initiate Operation
Valkyrie.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Then he’ll notify all district commanders
between Paris and Berlin that the SS is attempting to seize power. The
Reserve Army will arrest all SS, Gestapo and Nazi officials.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: When the time is right, Witzleben and I will
arrive at the War Ministry and assume the roles of Commander of the
Armed Forces and Head of State, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: With Berlin secured, Goerdeler will return and
address the nation as our new Chancellor. Then, God willing, we can
negotiate a truce with the Allies and spare Europe from total
destruction.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Gentlemen, this is the most important day of
your lives. Long live sacred Germany.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Put the Reserve Army on standby alert.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Not until I hear from Stauffenberg. Not
until I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: But that’s not what he-</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Noted, Colonel. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Claus von
Stauffenberg - Chief Officer of the Reserve Army.</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an honor.
They say you’re the man that will defend Berlin from the Red Army
single-hand-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Indeed. I’ve got the whole bag of
tricks right here.</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Let me take that for you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Colonel Stauffenberg?</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: At east, Gentlemen. General Fellgiebel,
communications. I just wanted to meet the hero of Africa… And see if
there’s anything you need.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Yes, sir, there is. I’m expecting a
call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference
with the F�hrer I’d appreciate it if you had a man come and get me.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: Of course, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Gentlemen. The meeting has been pushed
forward to 12:30. Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and
Hitler wants to have lunch with him.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Will Mussolini be in the briefing?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: I only wish he were. Then some ambitious
officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I’ll need a place to wash up - change
my shirt.</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Please, do be quick. You heard the
General.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: You’re arming them… now?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: No room for error this time. Assume I
have ten minutes in this heat.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Two minutes for the walk, one for the
security check and one to the bunker. Three minutes for the walk back.
That’s seven.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: Leaving just three minutes to place the
bomb.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Plenty of time.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: If the bomb goes off in ten.</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Major Freyend speaking. Stauffenberg? Yes,
he’s arrived… They are on their way now.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Dammit man, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: General Keitel insists that the Colonel
please hurry.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: The Colonel is changing, Major. You
understand this can be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: See that the car is ready.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: But sir-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I have everything I need, Lieutenant.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Please. Let me help you with that.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I can manage, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Where are they going?</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: It’s too hot. The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The conference hut. The door and many
windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open. Not ideal for
generating the deadly air pressure vital to Stauffenberg’s plan. But
this obstacle only seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier
after all. And no military operation goes according to plan. Making
matters worse:</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Sir, your briefcase. I insist.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: My injuries left me a bit hard of
hearing. See that you place me as near the F�hrer as possible.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Sergeant. I’m expecting an urgent call
from Berlin…</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: The Eastern Front forces are assured a
victory… but they need reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Please pardon our tardiness… You remember
Colonel Stauffenberg?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: As you can see, Mein F�hrer, the situation
in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it’s
urgent.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Colonel… Colonel, you forgot your-</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: …And now I believe Colonel Stauffenberg
will present us with his deployment for the Replacement Army should the
unthinkable occur and the Russians reach-</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Where the hell is Stauffenberg?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Contact General Olbricht in Berlin.
Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever all
communications.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: I said Olbricht. General Olbricht at the
War Ministry. The call is urgent.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: What the hell just
happened?</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: What does it look like? The F�hrer
is-</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: Alive…</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We have to get to the airfield at
once. Orders form the F�hrer.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: I am calling from The Wolf’s Lair with
urgent news for the General. Something terrible has happened…</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: The F�hrer is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m sorry. Please come again.</p>
<p><strong>fellgiebel</strong>: Sever all communications.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: I didn’t hear you. Come again. Fellgiebel.
FELLGIEBEL.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Well, what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: I… couldn’t be sure. It sounded as though he
said… Hitler is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Get him back on the line.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Sir… The bomb did go off. That much was
clear. Fellgiebel’s next step will be to sever all communications.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit. We
initiate Valkyrie regardless.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Only Fromm can initiate. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Then lie. Tell him Hitler’s dead. Or arrest
him. But do it now.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Sir… Did you hear me? You have to give the
order to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only-</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I’m not doing anything until I talk to
Fellgiebel. Get him back on the phone. NOW.</p>
<p><strong>kolbe</strong>: No one gets in or out.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: We’re on orders from the F�hrer. We
have to get to the airfield immediately. You will step aside.</p>
<p><strong>kolbe</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, but my orders are-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Get me General Keitel.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Yes… General Keitel. Stauffenberg
here. I can’t get past the outer gate. A Sergeant…</p>
<p><strong>kolbe</strong>: Kolbe.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Sergeant Kolbe says no one is getting
out… Yes. Yes. Maybe you can explain it to him.</p>
<p><strong>kolbe</strong>: That won’t be necessary, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Every second we stand here arguing is a
second lost.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I can’t initiate Valkyrie without
confirmation that Hitler’s dead. It’s too great a risk.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: What about Stauffenberg? What about his risk?
He did his part and now you’re abandoning him.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Watch yourself, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Shouldn’t you be consulting Beck?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I know just what Beck will say. He’s a
dying man. What does he have to lose?</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: At least put the Reserve Army on alert.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I can’t cover up another false alarm. When
Stauffenberg returns, when he gives me confirmation. Then we’ll
proceed.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: And where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: The same place you are. Lunch.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The one-eyed Colonel…</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Stauffenberg.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He left the building very abruptly - just
before the explosion.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Several men left the building before the
explosion.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, sir. Of course. But…</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: But what? Spit it out, man.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well. The Colonel left his hat.</p>
<p><strong>freyend</strong>: Pardon the intrusion, sir, but I think you
will be most interested to hear what this man has to say.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Orders from General Olbricht.</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: Send it through. But keep me informed.</p>
<p><strong>hagen</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Quiet, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: I’ll see where our driver is.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: You mean to tell me that the alert is only
just going out-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: This is Stauffenberg. Get me General
Olbricht.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Explain this.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Someone had to do something while you were
playing dead.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: We don’t know that the F�hrer is not
alive. We don’t know any-</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: General Olbricht’s office.</p>
<p><strong>mertz</strong>: Stauffenberg for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: It’s been three hours, Olbricht. What
the hell have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: We’ve had no confirmation that-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Dammit man, I saw the explosion
myself. Nothing else matters now. We are committed.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Dear God.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Now where is Fromm? Is he with us or
did you-</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I- No one has spoken to him yet.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind
Germany. Never mind Europe. Your life is at stake now, do you
understand? If you want to live through the night you’ll do exactly as I
say.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: The second you hang up the phone,
initiate Operation Valkyrie in Fromm’s name. Then go over to his office
in force, give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate
arrest. Do I make myself perfectly clear?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I am at the airfield now. I will be in
Fromm’s office in fifteen minutes. Be there when I arrive.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: Get Beck and the others. Tell them it’s
time.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: This is General Olbricht calling on behalf
of General Fromm - Commander of the Home Army. Adolf Hitler, is dead. A
group of radicals from the SS are attempting to seize control of the
government. Operation Valkyrie is in effect. All military districts,
training schools and replacement troops are to take control of essential
government offices at once…</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: The F�hrer is dead.</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: You all know your jobs. Get to work.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sergeant. This order is signed by
Witzleben.</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: That’s ridiculous. He`s not even in the army
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: Pass the order along.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Who told you the F�hrer was dead?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf’s
Lair.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: This is Fromm. Put me through to The Wolf’s
Lair.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: There’s no use calling, all communication
lines are-</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Yes. General Fromm for Field Marshal Keitel.
Urgent.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: What’s going on up there? The most incredible
rumors are circulating in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: I don’t know what you mean. Everything’s in
order here.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: There’s talk the F�hrer’s been
assassinated.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Another failed attempt. The F�hrer was never
in danger. By the way, where is your man Colonel Stauffenberg?</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Stauffenberg? On his way back to Berlin, I
should think.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Let me know when he arrives. I’d like a word
with him.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: A false alarm. The F�hrer is fine.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Hitler is dead. Operation Valkyrie is
in effect.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Be that as it may, the Reserve Army is
assuming control here in Berlin. We trust you’ll join us.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Dammit, man. Do you realize what you’ve done?
The F�hrer is a-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I delivered the bomb myself. I saw the
blast. He is dead.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Lt. Herber, who sees Stauffenberg as the
model Nazi, is more shocked by this than the news of Hitler’s death.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: This can’t be happening. It’s some kind of
joke.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Are you with us or not?</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Colonel, if what you say is true you should
shoot yourself at once. The rest of you are under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: No, General. You are.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: I don’t know where you think this is going,
but I suggest you men change into civilian clothes and find a place to
hide.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Lock him upstairs in his private
quarters. Make sure his phone lines are cut.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You’re not in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: This has to be seen as a movement of the
people.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: You’re certain he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>young officer</strong>: Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We’re
reporting for duty.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Helldorf, I’m… glad to see you. We’re
getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster. Can
we count on the police?</p>
<p><strong>helldorf</strong>: There’s a lot of talk that Hitler isn’t
really dead. Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I can’t offer you any guarantees. The
decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you?</p>
<p><strong>helldorf</strong>: I’m with you.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Have your men surround the building.
No one gets in or out of here without my permission. I want every
available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every
government building in the city. Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated. We
represent a different form of government. We represent what is good and
just in Germany.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: …Deploy troops to seize and protect
all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers -
newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi
officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once…</p>
<p><strong>hase</strong>: … Completely blockade the government quarters.
Everything from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not
even generals or ministers, should be allowed to pass. You have your
orders, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>hase</strong>: Is there a problem, Major?</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: It just all seems very… vague, sir. Protocol
dictates we should receive orders in writing-</p>
<p><strong>hase</strong>: These are the orders as they were presented to
me, Major. Now move.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A staff car - Major Remer in the back,
watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen emerges from the
chaos on the streets.</p>
<p><strong>hagen</strong>: Major Remer. We’ve just had orders from the
War Ministry. The battalion is to blockade the government quarter and
place Minister Goebbels under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>hagen</strong>: What is it, Major?</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Something just doesn’t feel right about this.
I would hate to find out I’m being taken advantage of.</p>
<p><strong>hagen</strong>: A coup you think?</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Of that I am certain. What I can’t say is
which side we’re on. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Take us to the Reichministry. Be quick about
it.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Send him in. It’s all right. Send him
in.</p>
<p><strong>fat general</strong>: Begging your pardon, but I have orders
to report to General Fromm.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: General Fromm is no longer in command. I
am.</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: Beck? What are you- What is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: The F�hrer is dead. The SS is staging
a coup. We’ve initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and
save Hitler’s Germany.</p>
<p><strong>fat general</strong>: I’d say there is a coup all right, but
it’s not the SS.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: You will present these orders to your
troops.</p>
<p><strong>fat general</strong>: I will do no such thing without
speaking to General Fromm. I swore an oath-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You have your orders. Join us or face
the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>fat general</strong>: This is treason. I won’t take part. The
F�hrer is not dead. THE F�HRER</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Lt. Herber. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Lt. Herber. “Who, me?” He reluctantly
steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Lock him up with Fromm.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: I am ready to be connected.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: What can I do for you, Major?</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Minister Goebbels, my battalion has an order
to blockade the government quarter and place you under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Are you a dedicated Nazi, Major?</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do you recognize my voice?</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Of course, Mein F�hrer.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Then listen to me very carefully…</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: What is it now, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: It’s just that now we’re getting conflicting
orders, sir. The Wolf’s Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg another.</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: Our job is not to interpret the orders. Our
job is to pass them along. Regardless.</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: Yes, but sir-</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: Release these men at once.</p>
<p><strong>hagen</strong>: But these men are part of a coup.</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: I’ve just been on the phone with Hitler
himself. We are the coup, you idiot. We’ve been duped.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Well, Lieutenant. What do you make of all of
this?</p>
<p><strong>herber</strong>: I… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: I won’t ask you to make a choice. That’s for
you and you alone. All I ask is that you observe and think for yourself.
In time you’ll see things for what they truly are. You know where to
find me when you do.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Lieutenant. Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>herber</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Have you seen the F�hrer? Is he-</p>
<p><strong>himmler</strong>: It seems the conference table shielded him
from the blast. He’s lucky to be alive. Do you want to tell me what’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Everything is under control. I’ve taken
charge of the Guard Battalion and given them new orders. We’re turning
the tables on these cowards.</p>
<p><strong>himmler</strong>: I’ve been sent here personally by the
F�hrer to collect the conspirators. He insists they be taken alive.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Take this down. By order of Adolf
Hitler…</p>
<p><strong>helm</strong>: It’s a coup all right… And when it’s over,
we’d better wind up on the right side. Now we can’t afford to remain
neutral any longer. We have to make a decision.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Haans. All eyes watch him weigh the
decision of his life, of many lives. Millions in fact. Finally he
relents, handing one paper to Helm.</p>
<p><strong>haans</strong>: Very well. Send all communications from the
Wolf’s Lair. Stop all communications from Stauffenberg.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: Today an attempt was made on the
F�hrer’s life…</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: …The F�hrer himself suffered no
major injuries and resumed his work immediately…</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Send the following teleprint to all
Army Commanders… `Broadcast communique not correct. The F�hrer is dead.
Orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch.’</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: I saw the blast…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What the hell kind of coup is this?</p>
<p><strong>witzleben</strong>: The military districts are receiving
contradictory reports. I’ve got men sitting around joking about whose
turn it is to arrest whom. Neither the capital nor the radio network are
under our control. And where are the troops? You’d think there would be
some activity going on in this city. The word is all over the street
that Hitler is still alive. We trusted you and you failed us. You should
have stayed. To be sure.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: And who would have led the men here in
Berlin? You?</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: The Colonel did more than any man could
have hoped. If anyone is to blame it’s-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: Field Marshal Witzleben is right. I am
the officer in charge. I am the man responsible. No one else.</p>
<p><strong>witzleben</strong>: I’m going home to await my inevitable
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>olbricht</strong>: I’m sorry, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>herber</strong>: Arm yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: Thank you, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>haeften</strong>: Better I die for Germany than for
Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Colonel Stauffenberg.</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: If you have any last messages, you’d better
write them now.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: My actions speak for me. I’d rather my
wife and children remember our last time together.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’d like a pistol, please.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: For personal reasons.</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: General, my orders are to deliver the
prisoners alive.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Noted, Major. Get on with it then.</p>
<p><strong>remer</strong>: But, sir-</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’m thinking of earlier times…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The conspirators turn away, unable to
watch. Except Stauffenberg.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Very well then… A court martial, convened by
me in the F�hrer’s absence, has pronounced sentence: Colonel Mertz von
Quernheim, General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften… And the Colonel, whose
name I will not mention, are condemned to death. Take them outside.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: The F�hrer will want to put us on
trial, make an example of us. This won’t win you any favor. And it won’t
hide you’re involvement.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Involvement. I don’t know what you-</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: You knew and you did nothing. You’re
just as guilty as we are. Even more so.</p>
<p><strong>fromm</strong>: Spare me, Stauffenberg.</p>
<p><strong>stauffenberg</strong>: No one will be spared.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: My comrades. Once again - I don’t know how
many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: I speak to you tonight for two reasons.
First, so that you can hear my voice and know that I am unhurt. And
second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in
German history…</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: A small clique of ambitious, dishonorable,
stupid officers have conspired to eliminate me. Except for a few bruises
and burns, I was completely untouched.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: I see in this the hand of Providence…
directing me to complete my work.</p>
