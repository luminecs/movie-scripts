<h1 id="milk">milk</h1>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: This is Harvey Milk speaking on Friday
November 18th. This is to be played only in the event of my death by
assassination…</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen
table in a cluttered San Francisco apartment.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: During one of the early campaigns, I
started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my
signature…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hello, I’m Harvey Milk, and I’m here to
recruit you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If I was speaking to a slightly hostile
or mostly straight audience, I’d try to break the tension with a
joke…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I know, I know, I’m not what you were
expecting, but I left my high heels at home. Harvey gets a LAUGH from
the AUDIENCE.</p>
<p><strong>return to</strong>: Harvey speaking into his tape
recorder.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I fully realize that a person who
stands for what I stand for - an activist, a gay activist - becomes the
target or potential target for a person who is insecure, terrified,
afraid or very disturbed themselves…</p>
<p><strong>dianne feinstein</strong>: As President of the Board of
Supervisors, it’s my duty to make this announcement. Both Mayor Moscone
and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot… and killed. GASPS from the
REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard.</p>
<p><strong>dianne feinstein</strong>: Police are looking for a suspect…
Supervisor Dan White.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Something has happened.</p>
<p><strong>return to</strong>: Harvey speaking into his tape
recorder…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Knowing that I could be assassinated at
any moment, I feel it’s important that some people should understand my
thoughts. I think that– I wish I had time to explain everything I did.
Almost everything that was done was done with an eye on the gay
movement.</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “New York City. 1970.” HARVEY, 40, is HEADING
UP THE STAIRS from the subway platform. He is wearing a SUIT, but he’s
less than clean cut. His hair is brushing past his ears.</p>
<p><strong>harvey’s very interested pov</strong>: SCOTT SMITH, 22, a
sexy curly haired hippie in tight jeans and boots, is HEADING DOWN THE
THE STAIRS. Harvey tries to make eye contact.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hey. I’m Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Okay, Harvey…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Today’s my birthday. No, today is
actually my birthday. Well, tonight. At midnight.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And, believe it or not, I don’t have
any plans. People took me out after work…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Work? So, that would be… Let me guess.
Ma Bell or AT&amp;T.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The Great American Insurance Company.
I’m part of the big, evil, corporate establishment that, let me guess,
you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from Vietnam to
diaper rash.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You left out bad breath. Falling for
it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They both smile, realizing
they share a wry sense of humor. A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work
fast.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: So… You’re not going to let me
celebrate my birthday all by myself are you?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Listen, Harvey, you’re kind of cute for
a suit… But I don’t do guys over forty.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Well then, I’m in luck.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Because I’m still thirty-nine… And it’s
only eleven-fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Jackson, Mississippi.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Well, this isn’t Jackson, but you still
can’t respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform. It’s
too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Now you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: There’s nothing tougher than a New York
City cop. They’re arrogant, and they’re everywhere. I’ll show you the
cruising spots, if you want, if you promise you’ll be careful… little
Scottie-san.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Are you on uppers or what?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. This is just… plain old me.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You’re afraid of the cops?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m just discreet. I know a lot of
people here. If they found out, I could lose my job.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Oh. You’re one of “those.” I think you
need a change of scenery. New friends.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I need a change.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You’re forty now.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Forty years old and I haven’t done a
thing I’m proud of.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You keep eating like this and you’ll be
a fat ass by fifty.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. Don’t you worry. I won’t make it to
fifty. Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding, he
rubs a slice of pie in Harvey’s face. Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from
his eye, and tackles his young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess
getting everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott’s hair.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t we run away together?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>return to</strong>: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. the
film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: In those days, San Francisco was the
place where everyone wanted to go… To drop out… To fall in love…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: But by 1972, The Haight was boarded up.
Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The new place for us refugees was this run
down Irish Catholic neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six blocks square…
The Castro.</p>
<p><strong>we see what harvey sees through the lens: a hardware
store,</strong>: a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows…
Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro Theater, big
letters spelling out… “C A S T R O…” Harvey points his camera across the
street at the gray- haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS
of his face, an expression of distrust. Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the
liquor shop window that reads:</p>
<p><strong>“eureka valley merchants society.”</strong>: Harvey’s CAMERA
focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS WALKING PAST, one puts his arm
over the other. To Harvey’s eyes it’s a very new site. It’s overt.
Thrilling. Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT
SIGN hanging out front.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I cashed my last unemployment check
yesterday…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Well, I hope you did something useful
with it.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I bought an ounce of pot. I was just
wondering if you had any</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: plans, or thoughts… About us doing
something to, you know, bring in an income.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Don’t move. Harvey straddles Scott. He
begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I suppose I can wait tables.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: No way. I want you right here with me… Did
you see place downstairs is for rent?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I was thinking we could open a shop
together.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: What kind of shop?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: One with very little overhead. Not too
much work… A little one, just like Morris and Minnie Milk of Woodmere,
New York…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Just a little to the left… The old
liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses the street to
watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hello there. I’m Harvey Milk.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnelly</strong>: You’re the new renters?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I want to join the, um… What is it? The
Eureka Valley Merchant’s Association. I want to help in any way
possible. I’m no interloper. A Jew perhaps, but I hope you’ll forgive
that. McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnelly</strong>: I don’t think your application will be
approved, Mr. Milk. This is a family neighborhood. Your kind are far
more welcome on Haight street.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What “kind” do you mean, sir?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnelly</strong>: The Merchant’s Association will have the
police pull your license if you open your doors.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Based on what law?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnelly</strong>: There’s man’s law and there’s God’s law
in this neighborhood and in this City. The San Francisco Police force is
happy to enforce either.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Thanks for the warm welcome to the
neighborhood!</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: We pay taxes you know! Harvey grabs
Scott’s hand… keeps him from heating up, from pouncing. It’s not the
time for them to bite yet.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We’ll form our own business
association! Start with the gay- owned businesses… We’ll take down the
addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film. We’ll ask
them what they want to see done here… what they want changed… We’ll get
money rolling into this neighborhood. Revitalize it…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Can I come in now?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: One more minute! I’ll go to the
neighborhood banks. They must have some gay customers.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey. What’s with all this political
activist crap? I thought you were a goddamn Republican. Harvey walks
into the small dining room holding two plates of food. He sets them out
on a small dining room table, still rambling on to Scott in the
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m a businessman, Scott. I think
businesses ought to treat their customers right. Even their gay
customers. For God’s sake, this is San Francisco!</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey. It’s just like every other city
in this country. People hate us. Big surprise.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We should have at least one block in
one city right? Start there and take over the neighborhood. Okay, you
can come in now! Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT
with a home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Wow. This is–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Happy birthday! Scott chases Harvey
around the apartment, trying to smear some of the CREAM PIE onto
him.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS
milling about, eyeing the scene skeptically. Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE
CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.</p>
<p><strong>man on the street</strong>: Thanks for the party,
Mr. Milk!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Thanks for joining the Castro Village
Association! Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
Irish liquor store . He squeezes past them, into the store, leaving
Scott outside.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Excuse me gentleman… ladies. Hello!
Mr. McConnelly! McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the
new business.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I just wanted to stop in and see how
business was doing.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnelly</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: So you don’t mind all these homosexuals
in here, do you? McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is
curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly
here loves our kind. Spend away! Tell your wife Hello for me. Harvey
spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM, KISSING HIM ON THE
MOUTH. It’s quite the show. They step back out onto the street where an
Irish band is now playing. Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott
and spins him through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And people started hanging around our
store. Not customers. Activists, kids, folks who needed a home away from
home…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute art
student who I’d picked up at Toad Hall. Turns out he was also good at
running the Camera Shop… something Scott and I found we had surprising
little interest in… ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat
helpless.</p>
<p><strong>danny niccoletta</strong>: Opera is passe, Harvey. It’s about
street theater, now.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What you’re not getting is the
spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions… Danny jumps up and
IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of an opera diva, making Harvey
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great wit.
A Harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the
Castro… including himself. JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage
dental chair that sits in front of Harvey’s desk. He seems to be looking
for something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young man, 20s,
DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And somewhere along the line Jim picked
up a protege, a cute political kid from Wisconsin… Dick Pabich… And of
course there was Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular business with the
new kids… DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And on occasion we actually had a real
customer. But only occasionally. ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a
CUSTOMER, he’s out of place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD,
40s.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey… This guy wants to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Welcome. What can we do for you?</p>
<p><strong>allan baird</strong>: Hi, I’m Allan Baird. Teamsters
representative, and Director of the Coors beer boycott in
California.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He’s a
very big deal, so behave yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>allan baird</strong>: I was told you were like the Mayor of
the Castro, said you organized the CVA, you might know some people in
the bars.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I do have friends in awfully low
places, but just so you know, it’s not official yet.</p>
<p><strong>allan baird</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The Mayor part. I’ve considered
gathering an army of queers to march up to City Hall and secede, but so
far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans. But if I
could be of any use, I’m all ears!</p>
<p><strong>allan baird</strong>: We can’t get Coors to go union. These
guys are like me, they can’t be out of work too long. Harvey pulls Allan
aside, away from the audience, easing his nerves. It’s Harvey at his
best.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m just curious. Are we your first
stop or your last?</p>
<p><strong>allan baird</strong>: It’s been a tough one, Mr. Milk.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Well, you seem to have noticed that my
kind of people drink a lot of beer. If we’re going to fast for your
sake, I think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this
fight, don’t you?</p>
<p>****: Is that what you really want?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And allies. I’ll have Coors out of
every bar in the Castro by the end of the week. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>allan baird</strong>: Thank you Mr. Milk.</p>
<p><strong>jump to</strong>: Allan is on his way out. Harvey walks back
behind the counter to Scott.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No more Coors beer. It’s gotta come out
of every bar. Gay and straight.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: What’s he giving you?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Nothing for me. That’s a convert.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: A convert to what?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The cause.</p>
<p><strong>a still photo montage</strong>: Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny
get bar owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps,
throw out their Coors stock, put on “Boycott Coors” buttons and tape up
“Dump Coors” posters.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I got “my people” to get Coors out of
all the Gay Bars. 30 million bottles worth in San Francisco alone. Coors
beer immediately fell from number 1. They caved. One week later, union
man Allan Baird hired the first ever openly gay union boys to drive
Teamsters trucks… We weren’t just a group of pansies anymore. We had a
neighborhood. We had the unions. And for the first time, we had a little
bit of power.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Maybe that was the day someone first
called me the “Mayor” of Castro Street. Or perhaps I invented it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>young gay man</strong>: The fucking cops, man, they’re up on
Castro Street! Toad Hall. Harvey and the guys race out of the store.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Clear the sidewalk! Some of the GAY MEN move
out of the COPS’ way but some of them don’t move FAST ENOUGH. The COPS
start BEATING them. Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the
crowd, to get closer to the fight. To pull the cops off their friends.
Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event. Scott SHOVES his way
past the cops. A COP BRINGS HIS NIGHT STICK down hard on SCOTT’S
HEAD.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: …if we had someone in the government
who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has
black leaders who look out for their interests–</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You’re gonna run for Supervisor, is
that the idea?</p>
<p>****: I could go right for mayor, but I think I should work my way up
to it… You’ll be my campaign manager.</p>
<p>****: Because I have so much experience in politics.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Politics is theater. It doesn’t matter
if you win. You make a statement. You say, “I’m here, pay attention to
me.”</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey, you do that every time you
cross the street.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Coors looks like it might cave. The
union boys will owe me. Imagine if we get their vote… It’ll be fun!</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Fun? Harvey starts kissing him all
over.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We’ll make it a spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: A week ago, Police officers came into
our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the
hospitals, and to jail. The charges, “Blocking a Sidewalk.” Like a round
girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a blown up PHOTO from his
shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –Let us have our tax money go for our
protection and not our persecution. Worry about gun control and not
marijuana control.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: School supplies, seniors, not what
books I read– Scott displays an old “Muscle Boys” magazine. Harvey does
a well timed take. A few hoots from the eclectic crowd.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: My fellow degenerates, I would like to
announce my candidacy for San Francisco City Supervisor! Scott unfurls
three hand made “MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR” banners that lap over the
sides of the shopping cart.</p>
<p><strong>sf citizens</strong>: gay boys, older people, Chinese people,
scared straight people, heckling high school boys. Harvey EAGERLY
APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands if they’ll let him,
reaching out to old people, straight people, gay people, even buttoned
down BUSINESSMEN who cross the street to try to get away from him.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Public dental care for retired people…
Legalize pot, vote Milk. Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired
CLEVE JONES passes. At 18, he looks 15. Harvey tries for his
attention:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hey, I like the way your pants fit…
Where are you from, kid?</p>
<p>****: Sorry old man, not interested.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Where’s home?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m Harvey Milk. I’m running for
Supervisor. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Cleve… Jones.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up to my
camera shop and register you.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Fuck that. Elections of any kind are a
bourgeois affectation.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Is that right? Do you trick up on Polk
Street?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: If I need the cash… But I’m selective
about my clients.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Tell me one thing before you get back
to work then. What was it like to be a little queer in Phoenix?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I faked a lung disease to get out of
PE. So what? What are you, some kind of street shrink?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Sometimes. But what I’m saying is,
Phoenix can change. But we have to start with our street: rent control,
police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Well, good luck with all that.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You know what I think, Cleve Jones?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: That you’re gonna get somewhere if you
keep talking?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. That you need to do what you’re
good at. Be a prick. Fight City Hall. Fight the cops. Fight the people
who made you come here to do what you do.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Sorry old man, I’m leaving for Spain
tomorrow. Europe. Got all the cash I need in my back pocket. A GROUP OF
CLEVE’S FRIENDS shout at him to join them. Harvey watches him dart
across the street to his friends.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I didn’t come out until very late in
life. There was nobody to–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –look up to, no hope for a better life.
Those that did were outcast… arrested.. suicide. And the young ones, who
did escape home… and who arrive in San Francisco, and then what…</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: PARAMEDICS placing a BLOODY VICTIM into a
BODY BAG.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: The “fruit” was walking home with his “trick”
when they were jumped.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: Harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off
the street, the man’s last attempt to call for help.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Name’s Robert Hillsborough. Did you know
him?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: He used to come into my shop. Are there
any witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Just the “trick.” Jerry Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Jerry wasn’t a trick. They were
lovers.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Call it what you will. He’s our only witness
and he says he can’t identify the attackers.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: There’d be a dozen witnesses if they
thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You’re the Mayor of Castro Street now, right
Harvey? You really wanna help? Get your people to show some discretion
on the streets, huh?</p>
<p><strong>harvey’s pov</strong>: The PARAMEDICS pull up the zipper on
the body bag. We follow the zipper past the victim’s bloody hands, his
torso, his face.</p>
<p><strong>close on: a customer’s set of photos being passed from
hand</strong>: TO HAND DURING THE FOLLOWING POLITICAL MEETING. .</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: Well, it looks like the big guns and
the rich gays in San Francisco are going to back Dianne Feinstein and
other straight candidates they consider “gay-friendly.”</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Who cares about those old queens? Scott
is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Why isn’t my campaign manager leading
the meeting?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I’m beat, Harvey. I passed out flyers
for seven hours straight.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: In the bathhouse?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: People in bathhouses vote. I’m tired.
I’m taking a nap. Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment. A
CUSTOMER comes in. Danny quickly gathers the REVEALING PHOTOS and puts
them back in the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Just checking the exposure. That a new
boyfriend? He’s very cute.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Um… Thanks, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: So who are these so-called “gay
leaders?” And who appointed them? And what are you suggesting, Jim, that
I’m supposed to go and solicit their endorsement? PAST HARVEY WE SEE A
GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening the mail, casually reading a
letter, then rising and approaching Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We’re down here, on the streets, trying
to help people, so where they hell are they?</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: David Goodstein is the publisher of The
Advocate and he has a house–</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: A mansion–</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: –in Atherton.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Harvey, you should read this. CLOSE ON THE
LETTER as it goes from Thelma to Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: “Harvey Milk will have a dream journey
and nightmare to hell, a night of horror. You will be stabbed and have
your genitals, cock, balls, prick cut off.”</p>
<p>****: I’m calling the police.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: They probably wrote it. Hey, If
somebody tries to kill me, I’ll get the sympathy vote, right? Could be
just the push we need.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You think this is funny? Look at it.
Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It’s a complete joke. No rhythm. No
humor. It’s insulting.</p>
<p><strong>close on the letter</strong>: Someone has drawn a STICK
FIGURE of Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc. Harvey
makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerator, the first
thing he’ll see in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If you put it away, hide it in a
drawer, it’ll just get bigger and scarier. Now it’s there. We’ll see it
every day. It can’t get us.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: All this energy… to make yourself a
target. And what for? Something we have no chance to win. Harvey wraps
his arms around him.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I keep telling you, it’s not just about
winning.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The “top gays” in San Francisco were
David Goodstein and his lawyer sidekick Rick Stokes. David was a</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: rich old queen who’d bought the biggest
gay magazine, The Advocate. He had it delivered to subscribers in brown
paper bags so no-one would know… That’s how he lived his life, covered
up, discreet. Harvey and Scott are shown to the pool area by a HOUSE
BOY. Statues and potted plants and expensive marble. Everything shouts
“GOOD TASTE!” Scott strips off his clothes and DIVES INTO THE POOL.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: I worked for a financial
institution. I was very discreet. But someone spotted me at the opera,
sitting in a box, next to my lover. And I was fired. That’s when I
decided to do something. So I bought The Advocate. And I use my money
and my influence in quiet ways, to do what I can…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Endorsing straight candidates is what
you think is best to help us?</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: Yes, if they’re friendly to our
cause.</p>
<p>****: Politics is complicated in San Francisco, and Supervisor is a
citywide office. Political alliances need to be built. You can’t simply
move here from across the country and run for office.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: But I am running for office. I’m on the
ballot. I have the union rank and file, the seniors, and I could use
your magazine’s endorsement.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: Harvey, we’re like the Catholic
church. We welcome converts, but we don’t make them Pope the same
day.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And why haven’t you run?</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: It’s too early for a gay candidate
for Supervisor. Especially one from the Castro. It’s bad for the
community’s image. Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table,
naked and sopping wet.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: What’s wrong with the Castro?</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: Nobody works there. It’s all sex
and drugs and more sex and no one taking responsibility for their own
problems.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The cops come into our neighborhood and
beat us. They turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered.</p>
<p><strong>rick stokes</strong>: Then we file a lawsuit against the
city. We go to our political allies in City Hall…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: There are no real gay allies. Yes, our
friends may sense our struggle, but they can’t feel it. It’s not life or
death for them. We need our own in office.</p>
<p><strong>rick stokes</strong>: You can’t demand acceptance
overnight.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Why not? How can we ask them to respect
us if we don’t show ourselves some self respect, David.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: The more “out” you make us, the
more you incite them. Step back and quiet down.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Go back into the closet? Is that what
you’re saying? Because I know the closet. I lived in it for more years
than I care to remember. I don’t need your endorsement. I’m not asking
anyone for acceptance. I don’t have time to ask.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: For you, politics is a game, a
lark. Like putting on a rock festival or staging a “love-in.” You’re too
old to be a hippie, Harvey Milk! Harvey turns around, ready for a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m not a candidate, I’m part of a
movement. The movement is the candidate. There’s a difference. You don’t
see the difference. But I do.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Thanks for the swim. I’m sorry I pissed
in your pool.</p>
<p><strong>a slow motion montage of</strong>: the citizens of the Castro
are turning out to vote. Young, old, gay, straight… but a weight hangs
over the day.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: When the vote came in on election day…
out of 32 candidates vying for 6 seats… We came in 10th. Just a handful
short of being the first big eared, gay as a three- dollar-bill, cock
sucker ever elected to public office.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: So… I went for it again in ’75… with
just a few… minor… adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Harvey looking through a hole in the
bottom of a pair of well worn wing-tips. He tries them on anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>jump to</strong>: Harvey steps out of a dressing room in a
brown suit. His hair is cut short, his face is shaven clean. It’s quite
a transformation. Scott and the old owner, LILY, size him up.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: No. Not cute. The shoes are hideous and
I hate your hair. You’re not fooling anybody.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m not gonna let the Pacific Heights
biddies write me off again because of a ponytail. I like it. Scott is
horrified. Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs from its inner
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Cabaret? For two? Lily, is this from
one of my kind?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No, no. You won’t run into the owner. He died
in that suit.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: This isn’t sexy, Harvey. Harvey grabs
Scott, kisses him. Then playful:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Too bad. No more pot, no more bath
houses for me and little poo.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop.
More VOLUNTEERS. The printing press burns through flyers.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We ran and we lost the Supervisors race
a second time in ’75, but with</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: more votes than ever. So in 1976,
against everyone’s advice, I really pissed off the Democratic political
power houses, because I ran against “their boy”–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –Art Agnos, a part of their “Political
Machine.” And this time we weren’t running for City Supervisor. This
time it was bigger, California State Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It’s a racket. It’s 1976 and you still
have to be straight, white, Catholic and male to get into the San
Francisco police force. It’s Racist. Homophobic.</p>
<p><strong>art agnos</strong>: How many people do you consider enemies,
Harvey? I’ve counted five already. Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through
the audience.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You’re right, Art. And many are your
closest friends. You see, I don’t think State Assembly seats should be
awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine. Machines
operate on oil and grease. They’re dirty, dehumanizing, and too often
unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator.</p>
<p><strong>art agnos</strong>: Mr. Milk, I’ve worked for years as a
social worker in this city. I know Sacramento. I know how to get done
what we all need done there.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Tell me Mr. Agnos… right here in the
Castro, Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long
time partner. Stabbed,</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: fifteen times. The last words he heard
were “Faggot, Faggot, Faggot…” And you say you’re outraged, but why
won’t your liberal establishment return our calls? Why won’t they bring
these murderers to justice?</p>
<p><strong>art agnos</strong>: You know Harv’, your whole rap’s a real
downer.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: My God, you’re handsome up close. I
can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to licking you… in the
polls.</p>
<p>****: You talk a lot about what you’re against. What are you for? In
this town, you gotta give em’ a reason for optimism or you’re cooked.
Art gets into his car and goes. Harvey has no car. He stops and PONDERS
ART’S WORDS… They stick with him.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey. Dinner.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: … get some union boys in the audience, they
love me…</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: I can’t control who’s in the
audience…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey, you need to eat something.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen. Our apartment is
officially off limits. CHASES the VOLUNTEERS out of the kitchen, out of
his bedroom… down the stairs…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Downstairs. Time to go. Go. OUT! Harvey
emerges, about to intervene.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Don’t say anything. For once, Harvey
keeps his mouth shut. Jim and Dick sneak past Scott, sheepishly. When
Scott and Harvey are alone…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Sit down and eat. Harvey and Scott eat
dinner in tense silence.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: If you say one thing about politics or your
campaign or where you’re speaking tonight or whose endorsement you need…
I’ll stab you with my fork I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I just wanted to say… This is the most
delicious meal I’ve ever eaten in my entire life. Harvey gives a warm
smile. Scott gives a laugh, but he looks like he’s about to lose it.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If we lose this one, it’ll be just me
and you again. I promise. Scott nods. That’s exactly what he needed to
hear.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Phoenix? We should go inside. They do.
Harvey locks the door behind them.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: You staying up with me?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The election’s tomorrow. I won’t sleep…
Was he good looking?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: No. He was hideous.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hard to tell what’s worse. With me, my
boyfriends usually find better looking ones to cheat with.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I thought we were gonna spend the rest
of our lives together.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Guess what, Cleve Jones.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You’re going to meet the most
extraordinary men, the sexiest, brightest, funniest men, and you’re
going to fall in love with so many of them, and you won’t know until</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: the end of your life who your greatest
friends were or your greatest love was.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Is that supposed to help?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Maybe a little. Or not.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I went to Spain last month… long story.
In Barcelona, there was this memorial march for gay people who died
under Franco. The police tried to break it up. It started a riot. A
bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp, his wig flew off, but he kept
fighting. There was blood literally running in the gutter.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We could have a revolution here too.
But you can’t just use the Castro to cruise. You gotta fight.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: You think you’ll win?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Winning isn’t my strong suit.</p>
<p>****: Well, I don’t “do” losing. Ever. Maybe I should run for office,
and you can work for me. If you can do it, I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Can you assemble a thousand people in
an hour?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: All right, if I run again, you’re my
man.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: If…?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Polls open in 3 hours. Lets hit the bus
stops.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And we lost that Assembly Race too,
which made me a bona fide three- time, political loser.</p>
<p><strong>anita bryant</strong>: “Come to the Florida sunshine tree,
great tasting orange juice naturally, orange juice with lots of vitamin
c, from the Florida sunshine tree.” Harvey is alone in the shop,
surrounded by remnants of a celebration party that never happened. Jim
Rivaldo lets himself into the store. Jim has his maps rolled up under
his arm.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: We lost, but we lost by less! More
votes than ever… I remember when that used to work. I want to show you
something. This is remarkable. Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS,
color coded with precinct results from that night.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: The red is where you did best tonight.
If we can get the initiative on district elections to pass, and we can –
we can – our new Supervisor’s District will go right up Market. Right
around the Castro.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: If you run for Supervisor with this new
district, it’s a potential landslide. You’ll be the first up- front gay
man elected to major office in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I don’t know if I have another one in
me. Or Scott. But Harvey’s gaze deceives his words. HOLD ON HARVEY -
contemplating a FOURTH run for office.</p>
<p><strong>a chyron reads</strong>: “Landslide defeat for Florida Gay
Rights Law.”</p>
<p><strong>anita bryant</strong>: Tonight the laws of God and the
cultural values of man have been vindicated. The people of Dade county,
the normal majority, have said enough, enough, enough.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: Gays in Florida can now be removed from
their jobs and prosecuted if their “deviant” lifestyles are
uncovered.</p>
<p><strong>harvey’s pov out a window</strong>: FURIOUS GAYS pour out of
the bars BLOWING WHISTLES, raising TRASH CANS… It might turn into a</p>
<p><strong>anita bryant</strong>: Gays can’t reproduce, so they must
recruit young people into their lifestyle…</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: Bryant, a spokeswoman for the orange
juice industry, vowed to</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: bring her campaign to the rest of the
country… Harvey’s PHONE RINGS. He snatches it up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Scottie?</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry sir. I um… I read about you
in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t talk right–</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: Sir, I think I want to kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. You don’t want to do that.</p>
<p>****: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: In Minnesota.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You saw me in a paper in Minnesota?
How’d I look?</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: My folks are taking me to this place
tomorrow. A hospital. To fix me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with you. Listen
to me. You don’t have to hurt yourself, okay? Are you there? Here’s what
you have to do. Are you listening?</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Get on a bus. Go to the next biggest
city. New York, San Francisco, LA, or even Minneapolis. It doesn’t
matter. Just leave. You won’t be alone. There are people out here just
like you who will welcome you and love you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You’re not sick. You’re not wrong. God
does not hate you. Just leave.</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Yes. You can. Just get on a bus.</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: I can’t… I can’t walk, sir. I’m in a
wheelchair… Sir. Are you there? Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: That’s okay. It’s going to be okay.
Over the phone, Harvey hears the SOUND OF AN ADULT VOICE, someone
finding the BOY on the phone, then… The LINE goes DEAD. It’s all too
much for Harvey. There’s nothing a speech or a pep talk can do to fix
this. Harvey is overwhelmed. Dick comes upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: Harvey, you better come down. There’s
gonna be a riot. Moving in a daze, stunned by the call, Harvey digs out
A BULLHORN and heads out.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Out of the bar and into the streets!
Anita Bryant is coming after you!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: If you can’t control em’, we will.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Give me permission to march them.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I know you are angry. I am angry.
Follow me through the streets of San Francisco to share our anger!
Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob will follow.
Finally, they do. Cleve catches up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Are they following in back?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Yes. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I don’t know. We have to keep them
moving. Exhaust them. March them till they drop. We can’t have a riot
tonight. Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN. He starts a marching chant. The
crowd starts following along.</p>
<p><strong>jump to</strong>: Gays glare at cops. Cops beat their
nightsticks against their chests and power poles. Anger burns as Harvey
marches the mob toward City Hall. Dick and Jim catch up.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: They’re still too hot in back. They’ll
burn the joint down.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Help me turn them up Van Ness. We’ll go
all the way to Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: My name is Harvey Milk… And I want to
recruit you. The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I am here tonight to say, we will no
longer sit quietly in our closets. We must fight. Not just in the
Castro, or San Francisco, but everywhere the Anitas go. Anita Bryant did
not win tonight. Anita Bryant has brought us together… She is going to
create a national gay force! And the young people in Richmond,
Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi, or Woodmere, New York… Who are
coming out and hearing Anita Bryant on television telling them that
they’re wrong, they’re sick, that there is no place for them in this
great country, in this world… They’re looking to us for something
tonight… And I say, we have to give them hope! The CROWD goes WILD.
HARVEY’S SPEECH CROSSES THE CUT TO…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –Hope for a better world… Hope for a
better tomorrow… Hope for a</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: better place to come to if the
pressures at home are too great…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hope for the worker who awakens from
the American dream to find that all the jobs have left the country… We
gotta give em’ HOPE! PAN FACES OF TEAMSTERS - Several MINORITY FACES.
CLOSE ON</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: When San Francisco changed the voting
rules–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –they allowed people to elect
Supervisors directly from their own neighborhoods. A black neighborhood
could elect an African- American. Chinatown could elect a Chinese
Supervisor… And the Castro could choose me or Rick Stokes. But decent
art begs for balance, right? So little district 8, two miles south of
The Castro–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –promised to stay the same as ever.
Conservative, Irish, Catholic and with just the right touch of poetry,
they found themselves a handsome ex-cop.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’m not going to be forced out of San
Francisco by splinter groups of social radicals, social deviants, and
incorrigibles. You must realize there are thousands upon thousands of
frustrated, angry people such as yourselves waiting to unleash a fury
that will eradicate the malignancies which blight our beautiful
city.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Evelyn Lear’s in town, at the Opera
house in Tannhauser.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Clearly.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What if she strolls into the Castro for
a cocktail? Just one more. We can’t let Rick Stokes take it.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Let Rick have it. Nobody thinks you’re
a fraud here, Harvey. You’re not in New York, you’re not a closet case
asshole anymore. People respect you here. Relax for a year. Get us back
on our feet.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If people are ever going to take me
seriously, I have to win this one.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Since when did you care if anyone took
you seriously?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Anita wants to put us all back in
concentration camps. Rick Stokes is too weak to beat her back if she
gets to California. I have to be in office to protect us from them.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I can’t do another one. I’ll be back
for my sheets. If you’re not here, I’ll see you in the shop next week.
Scott picks up his box of clothes and starts out of the apartment.
Harvey, not meaning a word:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If you leave me right now… I can find
someone new.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I know. You’re a catch. Scott leaves.
Harvey is in shock, unable to comprehend the loss. Unable/unwilling to
reverse the choice he’s made.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –Ring out the old, ring in the new.
This is over. Done. I don’t want to see anything that say’s fucking
Assembly. This three-time loser faggot is running for Supervisor goddamn
it! ANNE KRONENBERG, 23, parks her motorcycle outside, WALKS INTO THE
CAMERA SHOP, and plants herself behind HARVEY’S DESK. Cleve, Mike, Jim
and Dick are STARING at Anne.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: Who the heck is she?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Our new campaign manager. She called
last week to volunteer and I asked her to help.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: Help or take over? What about
Scott?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We need new blood.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Guys… Anne Kronenberg. She’s a woman… A
woman who likes women. Odd, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Hi guys. Mr. Milk… Rick Stokes
isn’t pulling out. He’s officially filed to run against you. My friend
at The Advocate says David Goodstein is backing him.</p>
<p><strong>michael wong</strong>: A gay candidate against a gay
candidate. It’s unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: They’ll split the gay vote. The
straights will divide and conquer.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Try to find out when they’re going to
announce.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: You replaced Scott with a lesbian?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Anne worked on a recycling campaign up
North. She’s very organized.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: How do you know she’s not a plant from
Rick Stokes’ campaign?</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Are you guys always this
paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>michael wong</strong>: Yes. They take after Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Shouldn’t you be doing someone’s
laundry?</p>
<p><strong>michael wong</strong>: Right after you redecorate my
house.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Sir, my girlfriends say you guys
don’t like women. Just asking, is there a place for us in all this, or
are you scared of girls?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Gentleman, we already have a tinker
bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick in your three-piece suits. We need
someone to manage things. A woman this time. She’s the right price, and
she has bigger balls than any of you.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Just give me whatever’s left over
in the register at the end of the day. So should I call the Chronicle
about getting US an endorsement? No? OFF the group of misfits,
considering the addition.</p>
<p><strong>pan off</strong>: a large “RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT
5” poster to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing “MILK”
signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are filing in.
Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the lecture hall and
confronts Anne.</p>
<p><strong>rick stokes</strong>: Young lady, you must be confused. This
is my night, not Mr. Milk’s.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: No, sir. I’m Harvey’s new campaign
manager. Anne Kronenberg.</p>
<p><strong>rick stokes</strong>: Then you should know this race is for
District 5, the Castro, not for all of your lesbian… compadres– A tough
lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads in. Rick looks
uncomfortable around all these women.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: I’m sorry. Are we distracting you,
Mr. Stokes? I’d hate to screw you up on your big night. Dick runs up
looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more off his game, Dick is
flirtatious.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: Hi Rick, handsome suit. Annie, do you
have any more hand cards?</p>
<p><strong>rick stokes</strong>: These people are not from this area.
They need to leave. Now.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: Not true. Guess where we found them
all, Rick? A slew of them. Way up on Valencia Street. Living right there
in our district. And you see, as it turns out, Annie here is very, very
popular with the ladies. Dick puts his arm around Anne. Rick is
stupefied.</p>
<p><strong>a weird moment</strong>: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands
him a flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY’S EYES lock
into the BOY’S EYES. Harvey reads the FLIER: “Unite and Fight for Dan
White.” Harvey looks back to pat the BOY’S head, but he’s gone. He looks
to the sidewalk for the kid… a parent… nothing…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: They’ve accused me of many things, but
never as blatant a lie as this.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: First ever newspaper
endorsement.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: They endorsed you for being a good
businessman? Has Scott read this? He’ll piss himself.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Yeah? Go show him.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Cleve, maybe you should go find a boy
to celebrate with. Just in case.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I’m going to The Stud. Meet me out.
Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone watching the
bargoers return home through his front window. A bitter-sweetness
lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out:</p>
<p><strong>gay man</strong>: Gonna win this time, Milk? They walk on,
not waiting for an answer. Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25,
stops. He stares in at the political ads in the window. Harvey watches
him sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall. The two make
eye contact. Harvey smiles. Jack tries to. Harvey picks up a folding
chair and walks it out to him.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: You’re more handsome in the posters.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Thank you. Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: …Palomino’s are my favorite horse.
They’re smart. They’re fast and compact. Do you think I’m more like a
Palomino or a Stallion? Jack smiles, out of his mind. Then he sits/falls
down into the chair, and slides off. Harvey stands above the passed out
young man. A newcomer. A wounded bird. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: My father beat me when he found out… So I
came here. I stay in this man’s house. But I don’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Shh, it’s okay, now. No one’s ever going to
beat you again. A long, comforting beat between them.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Do you even remember my name? Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: I love you, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And for the first time in my life, it
all came together… the union boys, the women, the seniors, the
minorities… All of the us’s showed up…</p>
<p><strong>rick stokes</strong>: We just want to congratulate him.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I’m sorry. We’re all full.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: Harvey! Harvey!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It’s too crowded. Sorry! JACK LIRA
shoves his way toward the door…</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Harvey! Harvey PULLS JACK INSIDE, right
past Goodstein and Stokes. Harvey CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF SCOTT
OUTSIDE…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Scottie–? But Scott fades into the
CROWD. Harvey is pulled back into the party.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: The new Mrs. Milk. I give it a
week.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Harvey, is this all for you? Are you this
famous?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No, darling. We do this all the time.
Do you like it? Jim is calling out NAMES of the OTHER WINNERS.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: Carol Ruth Silver… Gordon Lau… It’s the
most liberal Board in years!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What about Dan White? Did he win?</p>
<p>****: We’ll deal with him tomorrow. Harvey is DOUSED with
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>jump to</strong>: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER.
Jack squeezes his way under Harvey’s arm and into the picture.</p>
<p><strong>channel 5 reporter</strong>: Does this mean, as many
straights are concerned, maybe the gays are taking over San Francisco?
Are you going to be a Supervisor for all the people?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I have to be. That’s what I was elected
for. I have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of
all people, all their problems, the problems that effect this city
effect all of us. Thank you San Francisco! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>set to music</strong>: In his old brown suit, Harvey walks to
City Hall with a crowd of supporters. The familiar faces now include
Jack Lira.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear that
I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the
Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon
which I am about to enter and during such time as I hold the office of
Supervisor, City and County of San Francisco. Bulbs FLASH. A light rain
begins to fall. Umbrellas go up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Anita Bryant said gay people brought
the drought to California. Looks to me like it’s finally started
raining! Cheers. Harvey is emboldened.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: This will be the first time in many years that
we’ve seen so many new faces on the Board of Supervisors. Do you think
such diversity will cripple the Board?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The name of the game on the Board is
six votes to get anything passed. So, like it or not, Dan and I are now
in bed together… politically speaking. THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching
the program. He’s been up all night.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’ve assured Harvey here that my
brochure’s comments about “social deviants” referred more to junkies
than to his people. See, I’m about to have my first child. I have to
make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: How long were you a fireman, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: A couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And before that… You were a police
officer? Dan studies Harvey suspiciously… What’s his point?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You have something against cops?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. They tend to have something against
me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: But firefighters. Now those are true
heroes… They supported me in the last campaign. I support them
fully.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I meant what I said. I’d like to work
together. Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey’s handshake. It’s a step.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’ll see you at the office, Mr. Milk.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What do you think of my new
theater?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: A bit over the top.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What’s with the suit?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I got it from a friend. Harvey leads
Cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: When you come here, I want you to wear
the tightest jeans possible. Never blend in. And no elevators. Ever.
Always take the stairs, you can make such a grand entrance going up the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And street talk only around Feinstein.
Shit, goddamn, fuck,</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: all that. It bugs the hell out of her.
They arrive at his Lead Aide’s desk: it’s Anne Kronenberg.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Morning Annie, let’s set Cleve up on
mail.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Come into my office…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The first order of business that will
come out of this office is a city wide Gay Rights Ordinance. Just like
the one Anita shot down in Dade County. What do you think, Lotus
Blossom?</p>
<p><strong>michael wong</strong>: I think it’s good. Not great.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Then make it brilliant. I want Anita’s
attention here. In San Francisco. I want her to bring her fight to US…
This Bill needs a unanimous vote. We need headlines.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: Dan White won’t vote for this. Harvey
puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall, indicating Dan is
down there. Harvey whispers:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Dan’s fine. He’s just uneducated. We
can teach him. Dan pops his head into Harvey’s office.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Harvey, committee meets at 9:30. Oh, hi
Michael, Jim. Hey, did you get the invitation to</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: my son’s christening? I invited a few of
the other supes as well.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Great! All smiles, Dan leaves. Cleve
mocks him. OFF Mike Wong’s expression: THAT WAS BIZARRE.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Are you going?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hey. I’ll let him christen me, if he’ll
vote for my Gay Rights Ordinance. We need allies. We need everyone.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you’re
hungry. I only know how to cook one thing, but I make it good.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Did you… break in?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: I asked the boy downstairs to let me
in…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Danny?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: He wouldn’t let me in. So I came in this
way. Your friends aren’t very nice to me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I have a Town Hall meeting tonight,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: You work too hard. I’m sorry about your
window. I’ll fix it tomorrow. Are you surprised?!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Jack, I have to go. I have an
invitation to a party tomorrow. Lots of rich people, politicians. We
could get all dressed up… Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey’s hands
and guides him through a simple dance.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: So I could be the first lady?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: I watched TV here today. All day. I saw
All My Children. They killed Margo. I knew it was going to happen. They
try and trick you but it never works.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You always see it coming?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: What? Killing the blonde? Every time. I’m
good with that. I think now the old lady is going to have an affair.
Then she’ll get killed or married. Always one or the other. Dead or
married. Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It’s sweet,
intimate.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If I make you a key, you won’t break my
windows again, right?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: That’s right. The dance lesson is a
lovely distraction. Harvey won’t be going back to work tonight.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m proposing a citywide ordinance. It
ensures that a person who already has a job can’t be fired for their
orientation.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’m not sure my constituents would favor
that. Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Is anyone else here from the Board?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You’re the only one who showed up I
think.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Were you christened here?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My grandma
immigrated here when this was an Irish Catholic city. The City of
St. Francis… A lot’s changed here since then.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You’re more like one of us now… an
outsider.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You’re not like most homosexuals, are
you, Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Do you know a lot of “homosexuals?”</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Say, where do you stand on the
Psychiatric Center the City’s been pushing into my district?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Well, I’d have to study it…</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Getting it out of my district was a key
piece of my platform. It only attracts arsonist, rapists, all that, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Sure, sure. A campaign promise.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: A big one.</p>
<p>****: What do you say we watch out for each other’s interests? I’d
like that.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’d like that, too, Dan. Mary Ann White
approaches with their child. It’s awkward, as if she’s walked in on
something intimate.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’m sorry. Slipped into some shop
talk.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann white</strong>: Seems an inappropriate subject in
here don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hey, don’t knock it till you’ve tried
it. His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames. She cracks a
polite smile. They’re from very different worlds.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: Supervisors Silver and Lau are asking
you to vote to keep this Psychiatric Center in Dan’s district. It’ll go
down 6 to 5 if you vote to get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>michael wong</strong>: It’s a Youth Campus, Harvey. These are
kids that would be displaced from their families if it’s moved.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I can’t just dump Dan. The guy’s got
nothing going for him. No friends…</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Here we go, Harvey to the rescue. Isn’t
it enough we have to put up with Jack?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Lay off. He registered 120 voters last
week.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: So do any of your volunteers, but you
don’t make them all first lady.</p>
<p><strong>michael wong</strong>: What does Dan White do for you?
Really? Politically?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: He intrigues me… I think he may be one
of us. Everyone groans. Cleve camps it up:</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Dear God, say it ain’t so!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It’s just a theory…</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: You just think he’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No… I know what it’s like to live that
life. That lie. You can see it in Dan’s eyes… The fear, the pressure…
Anne Kronenberg walks in. She’s got that look in her eyes. Something’s
up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Good or Bad?</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Not great. State Senator John
Briggs is Anita Bryant’s go-to guy in California for sure. He’s filed
his petition for a statewide referendum to fire all gay teachers and
anyone who supports them. A pall falls over the room. This is worse than
expected.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: How many signatures will he need to
qualify for the ballot?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Whatever. He can get them in two
Sundays at church in Orange County.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: This means the fight’s coming here,
where we can do something about it! Wichita’s one thing, Kansas City.
But Anita’s heading for San Francisco! She’s not going to know what hit
her. Smile, children! This is the fight we’ve been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: My proposition promises to protect our
children from these gay perverts and pedophiles who recruit our children
to their deviant lifestyles, including the ones who</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: do it in our public schools. It’s time
to root them out. In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful,
worked up:</p>
<p><strong>tom ammiano</strong>: And how are you going to determine
who’s a homosexual?</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: Sir, my bill outlines procedures for
identifying homosexuals.</p>
<p><strong>another protester</strong>: How? Will you be sucking them
off?</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: Sir, you can argue with me, but you
cannot argue with God. It’s getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by
TWO OFFICERS. He trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Look what happened in Germany. Now
Anita Bryant already says that Jews and Muslims are going to hell, you
know she’s got a shopping list. We are not going to let John Briggs or
Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in this city… Hold on Dan watching Harvey
on TV.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: Hello, Harvey. Running late?</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: Oh Harvey… your boyfriend is in the
closet.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Excuse me, David?</p>
<p>****: The Latino, he’s locked himself in the coat room… Mr. Milk,
Phil Burton is here. He’s likely the next Speaker of the House and a
much needed ally against Prop Six. We don’t need a scene.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You’re right, I know, I was late by
twenty minutes. I’m sorry, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Who were you with? Scott? Some boy?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I was at work. Come out, sugar pea.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: No. You embarrassed me. I didn’t know
anyone. These are not good people. I don’t want to be here.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Then go home, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: No. I’ll wait for you. Go away. A tight
smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: The Briggs initiative is polling at
75 percent for approval statewide.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: 80 percent in other polls. Some even
have us losing San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: So it’s important we not deceive
people into thinking we can beat this, or we’ll have riots and only
increase this backlash.</p>
<p><strong>harvey jones</strong>: Good point, David. Let’s just roll
right over. Make it easier for Briggs to fuck us up the ass. Rick and
David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it, passing out copies of
his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier.</p>
<p><strong>phil burton</strong>: We’re taking this very seriously in my
office. We want to send one of these to every home in California. We’ll
need money to do that.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: “Proposition Six is an affront to Human
Rights. An invasion of the State into the private lives of California
citizens.” Does it even say the word gay on this thing? Anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: No Harvey, purposefully not.</p>
<p><strong>phil burton</strong>: With the heat bearing down on your
movement right now, we think it’s best to dodge the “gay” bullet. Go for
the human rights angle.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: People need to know who’s affected.
This flier needs at least one old queen on it. Why don’t you volunteer
for that, David?</p>
<p><strong>rick stokes</strong>: Corey Wares is an out gay–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: This is shit. Shit and masturbation.
It’s a coward’s response to a dangerous threat.</p>
<p><strong>david goodstein</strong>: I think you should leave. In the
face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree. HARVEY PUTS PHIL
BURTON’S FLYER IN THE FIREPLACE on his way out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Jack, it’s time to go. Get everyone
together. I want young people, women, fresh heads. Fighters and
organizers, not politicians.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: What about, S-C-O-T-T? OFF HARVEY,
knowing Scott would be an asset. Jack opens the door and grabs Harvey’s
hand. They go.</p>
<p><strong>other young activists.</strong>: A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY
GUY is setting down boxes of pizzas. They’re in for the night. The
atmosphere is 180 degrees different from the previous stuffy
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: We’re not interested in working with
those old Democratic Party shits. THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters.
He’s HOLDING THE HAND OF… SCOTT SMITH. They are obviously a new
couple.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: But we can’t afford infighting anymore,
Cleve. We have to bring together every group. Even the old school
Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy, or
are we just gonna stare? People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA
GUY.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If we’re gonna convince the 90% to give
a shit about us 10%… We have to let ’em know who we are. Everybody’s
coming out. The entire state. No matter where they live.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: “Come out, come out, wherever you
are!”</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m serious. We’re going to tell
everyone in the state to come out. Every gay doctor, lawyer, teacher,
dog catcher… We have to leave the ghetto, let all those people out there
know that they do know one of us. And if people won’t step out of the
closet, we open the door for them.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: The whole state is not San
Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Clearly, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: It could be dangerous. There is such a
thing as a right to privacy.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Privacy’s our enemy. You want real
political power? Let’s tell the truth for a change. Starting here. If
there’s anybody in this room, right now, who hasn’t told their families,
their friends, their employers… Do it. Now.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: My folks know already. A beat. The
room is silent. Dick looks ill.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: I haven’t told my father yet…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: People vote two to one for us if they
know just one of us.</p>
<p>****: Cleve, show Dick where you keep your phone.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: It’s in the bedroom. After a moment,
Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room. People are stunned by
Harvey’s outrageous demand. Harvey sees Scott GLARING at him.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I thought you were done with
politics.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Politics. Not the movement. What the
hell was that in there?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The movement needs people to be up-
front. Why were you fighting me?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You were the biggest closet case alive
in New York. You told me and all your boyfriends to keep our</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: traps shut. You were the hypocrite in
there.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: My parents are gone. My brother knows.
I’m sure they knew.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I had to listen to your phone calls
home to Mom. Hear you deny that I existed. You want to be “normal” as
bad as any of us. More than any of us… Those are kids in there. You’re
asking them to lose their families.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If their families won’t love them for
who they are, who they really are, then they should lose them.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: That’s fucking insane.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Who’s he? Do you live together?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Someone I’m seeing. He’s good for me.
He makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Oh, Harvey, don’t… What’s that
about?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Har-veyyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: He needs me. Scott nods. THAT’S ALWAYS
BEEN HARVEY’S ACHILLES HEAL. He walks away from Harvey, leaving him
alone.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk dianne feinstein</strong>: I have told no lies
here Supervisor Milk, you will today or to Supervisor White come to
order. in the past–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –I want it noted that I never promised
to back moving any Mental Health Centers. I greatly respect Supervisor
White, but I would like his remarks stricken.</p>
<p><strong>dianne feinstein</strong>: Duly noted. We will take a recess
before recording the vote. Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans
over to Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>carol ruth silver</strong>: Thank you, Harvey. Harvey is
preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Can I have a moment with Harvey? Alone,
please, Carol? She politely recognizes the tension and gets up.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Why are you turning on me like this at
the last minute? What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I didn’t have all the details. I’ll
help you craft a different version that doesn’t displace any kids.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Harvey, I can’t go back to my family and
to my folks and to my district without this. Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m getting a lot of pressure, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You strung me along. And now you’re
throwing me to the wolves.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You only need one more vote, Dan. There
are 5 other Supervisors you could convince besides me. Dan grabs Harvey.
It’s threatening. A new side of Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’ll vote against your Queer Law. I’ll
get Quentin against it.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It’ll still pass. You can’t keep
alienating yourself here, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I gave you a chance, Harvey. I really
did. You blew it. You really blew it. Dan goes, the rage of a scorned
adolescent under his suit.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Across the country, a handful of city
councils had passed the very first ordinances protecting gay people
against discrimination. But Anita Bryant and her right wing Christian
fundamentalists were creating and exploiting and fanning a backlash. Now
she had referenda to repeal all of these gay rights ordinances. While we
were preparing for the battle against Briggs and Prop Six, Anita Bryant
was taking her show on the road… sweeping the country. Her next stop was
Wichita, Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>chyron</strong>: “Landslide: Wichita says NO to Gays.” Anita
talks to a REPORTER. BRIGGS is among the supporters at her side.</p>
<p><strong>anita bryant</strong>: I give thanks for all of our foot
soldiers of God here in Wichita. But we must push on. Look what happened
to Sodom and to the world of Noah. Onward Christian soldiers!</p>
<p>****: On to California!</p>
<p><strong>96 i/e. telephone tree montage / effect - day</strong>: A
telephone tree MONTAGE starts with Cleve on a PAY PHONE on Castro
Street:</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Hi. We’re losing Wichita. Rally
tonight. Sundown. Market and Castro.</p>
<p><strong>a multiplying frame effect</strong>: the person he called
calls two others, they call four, then more and more as the tree
grows.</p>
<p><strong>harvey’s pov on</strong>: The VIOLENT DEATH THREAT LETTER AND
DRAWING that is still tacked up to his refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: The SOUNDS of a RIOT in the making. Harvey
rips down the threatening LETTER and throws it away.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: They’re moving. I don’t know where,
but…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Did Jim call the press? Get out there
with your camera!</p>
<p><strong>danny niccoletta</strong>: I’m going!</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Press is covered. But we don’t have a
permit to march.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: When I got Coors out of the bars, the
Union gave me this. I want you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: What do I do with this?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You’re an activist. Take it. March
them. March those people up to the front doors of City Hall. When it
looks really bad, the city’s first gay Supervisor will come out and play
peacemaker. We save the city from a riot. We can turn this night into
more political power for the cause.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I can’t do it like you do it.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I won’t always be here. Somebody else
will have to take over. I need you to be the scary one now.</p>
<p><strong>cleve’s pov</strong>: Harvey watches from afar. Encouraging
him.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Forty years ago tonight, the gay
citizens of Germany found out they no longer had civil rights. Tomorrow
morning, the gay citizens of Wichita will also awaken to find that they
too have lost their civil rights. You have whistles. You use them when
we have been attacked. Tonight we have been attacked. Initially Cleve is
successful, but then the crowd turns, marching toward City Hall without
him.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Fuck. Shit. Harvey! Cleve runs as fast
as he can to cut through the crowd, to get to the front. He gets on his
walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Get the press to the overpass!</p>
<p><strong>on harvey</strong>: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to
get AHEAD OF THE CROWD and beat them to City Hall.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Move… Left… Move… Left…</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: What are you doing? Where’s Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: We’re shutting down traffic, both
directions. Cleve looks up at the press that’s arrived on the overpass
above, and turns to two HIPPIE KIDS near the front.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Disconnect the power arms! The boys
climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms. Sparks fly. Brakes
squeal. The press snaps photos.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: The SOUND of the ANGRY MOB on City Hall’s
front steps. “Civil Rights or Civil War!” Someone THROWS A ROCK at the
City Hall doors. Harvey rushes out the front doors, pushing past the
police to greet THE MOB on City Hall’s front steps. Through the glass
doors we see Cleve rush up and hand Harvey his bullhorn:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hello. My name is Harvey Milk, and I
want to recruit you. I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve our
democracy against the Anita Bryants and John Briggs who are trying to
legalize bigotry! We have a choice to make. The fight is at our doors.
We must either go back in the closet and shut it tight, or fight…
History shows</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: that if we continue to fight, we… will…
win.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: They’re calling it a “successful
mediation.” You’re a God damn hero. Fuck. It came this close to a
riot.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Lose the note cards next time. Your job is
just to say into that bullhorn what they’re all feeling.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: You’re just jealous it wasn’t you out
there.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We’re losing Prop Six by 60% and you’re
over there celebrating a riot. I need more visibility… If we’re going to
beat this thing, we have to get Briggs to acknowledge us. Harvey steps
away, hot, pensive. Anne gets quiet.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Every paper’s calling Prop Six the
main event now. We lose this, we’ll have anti-gay laws in all fifty
states, and Briggs won’t return our calls for a public debate.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: He’s ignoring us to death.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We need something populist. What’s the
number one complaint about city life?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: The piss smell in the Tenderloin.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Close.</p>
<p><strong>frank robinson</strong>: Dog shit.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: If you cleaned up all the dog shit in
the city, you could be elected Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: “Mayor Milk.”</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>in the very same spot cleve just was</strong>: Harvey with a
clump of REPORTERS, a red and white “No on 6” button pinned to his lapel
.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Dog mess is a hazard, and on top of
that, it’s disgusting. Under the ordinance, dog owners that don’t clean
up can be fined. This really is the bottom line! He smiles at his own
joke, punctuating it by “accidentally” stepping in Cleve’s well-placed
dog shit. A BIG grin. BULBS FLASH. These flashes transition into:</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Supervisor Lau?</p>
<p><strong>gordon lau</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Lau, Aye. Supervisor Silver?</p>
<p><strong>carol ruth silver</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Silver, Aye. Supervisor White?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: White, No. Madam President, I have ten ayes
and one no. Dianne Feinstein BANGS HER GAVEL down hard.</p>
<p><strong>dianne feinstein</strong>: The San Francisco Gay Rights
Ordinance sponsored by Supervisors Milk and Silver is passed.</p>
<p><strong>camera’s flash! the packed chambers roar!</strong>: Harvey
locks onto Dan White. Dan makes eye contact. Harvey turns his attention
to the chamber audience’s applause.</p>
<p><strong>mayor moscone</strong>: I can’t get my stories on page ten,
you’re getting page one?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Doggy-doo’s a real problem, George.
With a shit eating grin, Harvey offers up a powder blue pen.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Powder blue to sign they city’s first
Gay Rights law… George, we need your help with Briggs… The gay community
will have your back from now on. On all issues. I hope you’ll have ours.
A beat between them. An alliance is forming. The Mayor sits behind his
desk and turns to the press with Harvey’s pen.</p>
<p><strong>mayor moscone</strong>: Good morning, everyone… I don’t do
this enough, taking swift and unambiguous action on a substantive move
for civil rights. Moscone signs the law with the powder blue pen. Harvey
leans over him. THE PRESS CAPTURES THE MOMENT.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What are you working on, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: If you have something to discuss, you can
have your aide make an appointment with my aide.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Listen, I know you’re disappointed
about the Psychiatric Center… What else do you have coming up?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Now you need something from me. You want
my me to join in with the Queers on this Prop Six business?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We prefer the word “gay,” Dan. Just as
I’m sure you prefer the word, “Irish-American” to “Mick.”</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Harvey, our society can’t exist without
the family, without the church.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We’re not against those things.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You’re not? Can two men reproduce?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. But, we keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: C’mon, Dan. You’re channeling Anita and
Briggs… we can work together. On something…</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Okay. You introduce an initiative for
Supervisor pay raises.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It’s a bad time politically. I have an
election next year.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You asked for something. Introduce pay
raises. I can’t take care of my family on our salaries. You don’t have
that problem, do you? Dan’s AIDE steps into the doorway. She seems
surprised to see Harvey in Dan’s office.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Mr. Milk, You’ll excuse me, I have a
development meeting. Dan goes.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What’s wrong, Taco Bell?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of
your table. You should fire them.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’ll take it under consideration. Why
don’t you get us a drink? A kiss and Jack heads to the bar. Scott
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Don’t let Cezar Chavez hear you calling
him Taco Bell.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: He’s getting better. He’s enrolling in
classes on Monday. Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey’s jacket.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: I remember when your birthdays were a
bit less… lavish. More intimate.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Who invited you? Anne?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: My boyfriend got an invitation. I was
his “plus one.”</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Congratulations. It was a tough ticket
to get.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Congratulations to you. Looks like
you’re part of the Machine now. You can do better.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: When I come home to Jack, I don’t have
to talk politics or talk intelligently. Or even talk.</p>
<p>****: And where’s an old man like me going to get such a good looking
young man, right?</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: You’re not so old. You look handsome…
Happy 48th. Looks like you’re gonna make it to fifty after- all,
Mr. Milk. Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS.</p>
<p><strong>harvey’s pov down a dimly lit corridor: a male
figure</strong>: APPROACHES, footsteps ECHOING on the marble floor.
Harvey braces himself.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Sorry I missed the party, Harv…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No problem, Dan. Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Dog poop?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: It’s good! It’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Thanks. But it’s a real problem.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Oh, yeah. I mean, God knows how many
problems it causes. All kinds of diseases, birth defects probably, I
mean, stuff you can’t even… Hey, I got you a little something.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You didn’t have to–</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You didn’t have to–</p>
<p>****: Why do people always say that? “You didn’t have to?” I mean, of
course, right? But, that’s what they always say. They always say things
like that… Dan’s attempts to be witty and erudite only leave him
confused and tongue tied. Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Are you okay, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Oh, what? Yeah, sure. Harvey, I just… I
just want to say… Happy Birthday. Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a
sort-of macho but really weird birthday hug. Harvey stiffens, it’s such
a peculiar moment. Dan steps back, looks him over.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’ve really learned a lot from watching
you, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: No, I have. You gotta get out there. Get
noticed. That’s how it works. But, you have an issue. That’s your
advantage.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It’s more than an issue, Dan. Dan. I’ve
had four relationships in my life. Three of those four tried to kill
themselves. I know it was my fault they did it. I told them to stay
quiet. To hide. Most of my life I’ve been closeted. That’s what living
this life is like for most of us. The way things are… This isn’t just
about our jobs, or any issue, it’s our lives we’re fighting for. Jack
emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on Harvey. Dan
steps back from Harvey and Jack, his moment alone stolen away.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’ve learned a lot from you, Harvey. I’m
going to get my picture in the papers, too. You’ll see. I’ve got my own
issue. That’s right. Dan White’s Got An Issue!</p>
<p><strong>stock footage</strong>: Along Market street: 375,000 people
have shown up for the parade, many holding signs naming their hometowns:
Newark, San Antonio, Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>a montage</strong>: of the various marchers, floats, “Parents
and Friends Of”, high-camp drag queens, etc. Harvey sits on top of a car
with a pink lei around his neck, a fistful of white flowers in one hand,
and in the other, a hand written sign: “I’m from Woodmere, NY.” To a
news camera:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Come out! Just come on out!</p>
<p><strong>driving the car</strong>: Anne keeps a close eye on the
parade watchers. Any one of them could be an assassin.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I see naked men walking around, naked
women walking around, which doesn’t bother me as far as my personal
standards of nudity, but it’s not proper. We wouldn’t allow it for any
other parade in San Francisco, and it should not be allowed for the gay
parade.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: It came in the mail today.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: “You get the first bullet the minute
you stand at the microphone.” Looks like the publicity’s working.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: You don’t have to go up there.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: It could happen any day, any night, any
time… The nation’s eye is on us. I have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>jump to</strong>: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the
massive audience hint at Harvey’s paranoia. Like diving off a cliff,
Harvey launches up to the microphone. The deafening cheers surely would
have drowned</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to
recruit you. I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your
democracy. Brothers and sisters, you must come out. Come out to your
parents. I know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how
they will hurt you in the voting booth! Come out to your friends, if
they indeed are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow
workers. Once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and
distortions. For your sake. For their sake. For the sake of the
youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On
the Statue of Liberty it says “Give me your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to be free.” In the Declaration of Independence
it is written “All men are created equal and are endowed with certain
inalienable rights.” For Mr. Briggs and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots
out there, no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase those words from
the Declaration of Independence. No matter how hard you try, you cannot
chip those words from off the base of the Statue of Liberty. That is
what America is. Love it or leave it. Wild applause. He scans the crowd
as he steps off stage. A bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs
him.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: The Mayor says Briggs is on his way
here. He could intercept him for us. We could get him face to face. He
couldn’t ignore us anymore.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Get the press.</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: The parade is the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: They’re taking us another way, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: I have a right to be here,
Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>mayor moscone</strong>: I’m afraid it’s not in the interest
of your safety, or my public’s safety to let you into that parade
grounds. Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for
the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hi, I’m Harvey Milk. It’s quite an
honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: I’m aware. Sad you’re too afraid to
fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No sir. I would love to have a public
debate. I’m very interested in the details of your argument.</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: You know the details. As do the people.
Look at the votes across this nation. The “public” is with me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Yes sir, today they are. But with my
City’s Mayor and the San Francisco press as my witnesses, I’m
challenging you to a public debate. John nods, stiff. He can no longer
avoid Harvey Milk. He gets back in his limo.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Senator, as a Christian it’s
interesting that you don’t seem to understand what Christ was about. He
was about accepting people and giving love, not carrying a Bible in one
hand and hatred in the other… …Now all the gay myths have been
shattered, all the fears, all the–</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: Not in my mind they haven’t–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: That’s it. In your mind they haven’t,
and I’m wondering why–</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: Mr. Milk, we don’t allow people who
believe in practicing bestiality to teach our children, and the reason
we don’t is because it is illegal. But it’s not illegal to be a
homosexual in California.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And your law goes even further. Any
school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired–</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: True. But, gay people don’t have
children of their own. If they don’t recruit our children, they’d all
die away. That’s why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children
to join them.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: How do you teach homosexuality? Like
French? I was born of heterosexual parents, I was taught by heterosexual
teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society. So then why am I
homosexual? And no offense meant, but if it were true that children
mimicked their</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: teachers, you’d sure have a helluva lot
more nuns running around. The audience eats it up. It feel like “The
Harvey Milk Show.”</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: If they’re going to lead such an open
life of homosexuality that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody
goes by them, those people are going to be in danger of being removed
their job.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We were really genuinely frightened by
Proposition Six, and with the backlash gaining strength, we were very
pessimistic. We didn’t think there was any chance we could beat it. What
we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose, there
would be a revolt… That all hell would break lose.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: People are coming out, though. We met
with groups in Bakersfield, Redding, a dozen people showed up in a
library basement in Fresno asking for our support if they came out. Last
Sunday, the Reverend of St. Mary’s came out to his entire
congregation…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: We’re still losing, 60 to 30. We have
to take the show on the road. Call Briggs’s office. Do a press release.
Tell them he can pick the town, the audience, and I’ll ask our
supporters not to attend.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: Their audiences are insanely devout.
We’ll get killed.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Get me Orange County.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: You just have to go down to LA and guess
the right things on TV and they’ll pay us… You have to use your fame now
while you have it. We could have nice things.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I don’t have time to do game shows
right now… This stops Jack cold.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: You are horrible! I have worked on this
surprise for you for weeks!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Are you drunk right now?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: You are an ungrateful asshole!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Jack, I’ll have more time soon.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: You’re ashamed of me!</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: That’s not true. I think you’re smart.
You’re capable. No matter what your family or your father said. I
believe in you… We should figure out something for you to do. I could
get you a job.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: I’ll never be good enough for you! Jack
THROWS A PIECE OF POTTERY AT HARVEY. It misses, CRASHING THROUGH THE
WINDOW onto the street below.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’ll get a broom. Harvey goes. Jack
collapses into a chair.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: If in your statements here you say that
child molestation is not an issue, why do you put out literature that
hammers it home, why do you play on that myth and fear?</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: Same thing with VD Harvey, we put out
publications about VD so you can avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: But you’ve even admitted that there’s
more molestation in the heterosexual group! So why not get rid of the
heterosexual teachers? Boos from the conservative audience.</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: We are not talking about homos… child
molestation, the fact is, at least 95 percent of the people are
heterosexual. If we took heterosexuals out AND homosexuals out, you know
what–</p>
<p><strong>john briggs harvey milk</strong>: –we’d have no teachers We’d
have no teachers–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –No child molestation… So you’re saying
the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child
molestation?</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: No, no, I’m not saying that at all–</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: That’s what you just said.</p>
<p><strong>john briggs</strong>: No. I’m saying that we cannot prevent
child molestation so let’s cut our odds down and take out the homosexual
group and keep in the heterosexual group– Harvey laughs in disbelief at
the asinine argument. Briggs looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes
the opportunity to rip into the State Senator:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –Sir, in your own drive for personal
power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed? How many lives
will you destroy in your lust for power, and when will you stop? The
crowd boos, rails. This isn’t San Francisco, it’s Orange County. In the
audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by the level of hatred. Harvey
tries to maintain his composure.</p>
<p><strong>harvey’s pov</strong>: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news
reporter. It feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: All I’m really saying is, if we don’t
protect ourselves with this kind of legislation, a transvestite can show
up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching and they
can’t refuse to hire him.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Hey Jack, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Nothing. I just want to know when you’ll
be home.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You just had them pull me out of my big
vote on the dog shit ordinance. Did you do this on purpose, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: It’s poop, Harvey. Aren’t I more
important than poop?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Yes, but… I don’t know when I’ll be
home. Maybe 6. 6:15.</p>
<p><strong>jack lira</strong>: Fine. 6:15. Harvey hangs up. His patience
is slipping. He looks up in time to see Dan heading down the hall with
his briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Dan? How’s the baby?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You didn’t bring up Supervisor pay
raises. In fact, I heard you plan to publicly oppose them.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I heard you planned to vote against
them too, Dan. Were you trying to set me up?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: It’s not a good time for me to bring it
up. Politically.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Dan, there’s a vote to approve the
police desegregation settlement, give me that and I’ll consider backing
pay raises.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I don’t trade votes… unlike you, the way
I was raised, we believe in right and wrong. Moral and immoral.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Black skin and White in your police
department? Dan, even Ronald Reagan’s come out against Proposition Six.
You’re looking more and more out of touch.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: If I come out against Prop Six, it’s only
for the invasion of State’s rights issue.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: And the potential witch hunts against
you “straight people,” right? Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent
response. He can’t. His behavior is alarming. He sets down his
briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You underestimate me, Milk. You’re very,
very wrong about me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I don’t know what you mean. A moment.
Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: What is it, Dan? You can tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You don’t… You can’t humiliate me. And
you will not demean me.</p>
<p><strong>passerby</strong>: You’re the asshole that just passed that
dog shit thing aren’t you? What the hell do you have against dogs?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Sir, blind people can’t see “shit.”
What the heck do you have against blind people? The young folks
surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at Harvey’s joke. Even the
harassing PASSERBY can’t help but crack a grin. Harvey beams.</p>
<p><strong>circus, harvey, what do you think of my last act?“</strong>:
Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack’s body, cold and discolored,
hanging from a beam by a noose. HARVEY CAN’T MOVE. He is mesmerized…
horrified. He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down. He
cuts through the rope and FALLS TO THE FLOOR with the HEAVY</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey. Look at me. Look at me. You did
everything you could.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: No, I didn’t. Not everything…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: What else could you have done?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I could have come home at six o’clock, not
six-fifteen. Scott puts his arm around Harvey. Harvey buries his head.
Anne helps Cleve take down Jack’s many hidden notes. Cleve quietly reads
a prominently placed one:</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: “Beware. The ides. Of November.”</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Jack was gone. I didn’t have time to
mourn… There was no choice but to keep on… to keep fighting.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Thank you for this great honor. But do
you think once the magazine is done snapping pictures, maybe I could
keep the suit for a while?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Would you like to trade with me?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No. What the heck are you?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Oh, me? I’m an elected official. I run
this city.</p>
<p><strong>dick pabich</strong>: San Bernadino is coming in. Not
good.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Of course not. How not good?</p>
<p><strong>michael wong</strong>: 60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Dear God, little Lotus Blossom. Harvey
is stunned. Other districts follow with similar results. They go up in
red on the map.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: Imperial is 69% “for” so far.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Put it up on the board. Harvey tries to
stomach this major defeat, loss after loss. He starts reflexively tying
his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up to Harvey, concerned.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The whole world is watching this. This
is San Francisco we’re about to lose. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I can have 15,000 people in an hour.
But there’s gonna be riots if this thing passes.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: There goddamn better be.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: What are you telling me?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I can’t say it because I’m a public
official, but for God’s sake, if this thing passes, fight back. Cleve is
stunned, holding the weight of Harvey’s words. Harvey’s focus is
interrupted when Anne brings him the phone.</p>
<p><strong>anne kronenberg</strong>: Don Amador down in LA.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Kind of a bad time, Don.</p>
<p><strong>young teen</strong>: No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave me
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Paul who?</p>
<p><strong>young teen</strong>: You talked to me on the phone a year or
so ago. I’m from Minnesota… I’m in a wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: The boy in his wheelchair on the other
end.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I thought you were a goner, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>young teen</strong>: I’m sorry. I should have called. When I
read in the paper that you won the Supervisor seat, I got a friend to
put me on a bus to LA.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Who did you know in Los Angeles?</p>
<p><strong>young teen</strong>: Nobody. That’s the uh… I just didn’t
want to die anymore, sir. I met your friend Don down here. I turned 18.
I voted today against Prop Six… Thank you, Mr. Milk.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: No. You did this all by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>young teen</strong>: I don’t think I’d be alive right now
without you, sir. You were right about LA. It’s like gay Disney
World.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Then you have to see San Francisco!</p>
<p><strong>young teen</strong>: Okay. I will. Don wanted me to um…
congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight.
Congratulations Mr. Milk. Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is
now coloring in LA county with green. On the other end of the phone,
Harvey’s friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line.</p>
<p><strong>don amador</strong>: It looks like we’ve taken LA County,
Harvey. By 65%. It’s huge.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I gotta go, Don. Thank you. LA by 65%
put it up! Put it up! The tone in the room is changing. Jim storms
up.</p>
<p><strong>jim rivaldo</strong>: The polls were off. Briggs is going
down by more than 2 to 1. The only district where it’s leading in San
Francisco is Dan White’s. Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map. Anne,
Dick &amp; Jim, all the volunteers. What this apparent win means to him,
to his people. To Cleve:</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Well crap Cleve, now what are we going
to do tonight?! Cover up Lady Liberty. The cameras will be coming our
way.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: To the gay community all over this
state… my message to you is… so far a lot of people joined us and
rejected Proposition Six, and now we owe them something… We must destroy
the myths once and for all, shatter them. We must continue to speak out…
and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come
out.</p>
<p>****: Tonight… Tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know
one of us. And now that they do, they see we are not sick… they can feel
we are not wrong… and they know we should have a place in this great
country and in this world… A message of hope has been to sent to all the
young people out there… to all those afraid of this wave of hate… to all
those who have lost their homes and their hometowns… tonight we know
there is a place for us! My brothers and sisters… we can come home
again! The crowd goes WILD. Harvey BEAMS. Moscone walks up onto stage
and lifts Harvey’s hand. Harvey is now a member of the S.F. political
elite. Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps off and disappears into
the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You ever heard of sore losers? Well,
I’m a sore winner… I thought we were goners.</p>
<p>****: I’d started looking forward to the riots.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: I told you, I don’t “do” losing.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I think maybe we’re best with our backs
to the wall. It’s too quiet. I think we should march on Washington D.C.
next year.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: Milk, you’re a decent politician, a
mediocre businessman, but you’re a lousy gay man. Take some time off.
Fifty’s right around the corner. Nobody will want you after that… I can
handle D.C.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: The people voted for us, Cleve
Jones.</p>
<p><strong>cleve jones</strong>: They did. There’s nowhere to march
tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk. Lets go back inside. Turning back, they savor
the moment, like father and son walking to Castro Camera, growing ever
smaller in the frame.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Could you give this to the Mayor for me?
As soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Morning, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I just resigned. Congratulations. I’m
sure you’re pleased. Harvey doesn’t know what to say. Dan’s right, it
does make him happy. But it’s not that simple.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You’ll be the next President of the
Board.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’m sure we could work together– Dan
walks away from Harvey. He doesn’t want to hear anything Harvey has to
say. Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER from the
POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Hey, Dan. Just got word. Can we talk to you
for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Sure… Dan heads for his office.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Downstairs. The Association meeting room…
Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to an
ASSOCIATION MEETING ROOM on the next floor. When the DOOR OPENS, Harvey
sees SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES from the Police Department wearing somber
expressions. It looks as if Dan is about to get REAMED OUT.</p>
<p><strong>actual footage</strong>: Channel 5 reporting from Dan White’s
street:</p>
<p><strong>david fowler</strong>: Most people were surprised when Dan
White quit last Friday citing financial difficulties. Now we’ve heard
that White is asking for his Supervisor job back. But many say–</p>
<p><strong>david fowler</strong>: –White gave up all of his political
chits when he resigned without making any arrangements. The news story
transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: The city of San Francisco is in
disbelief. Four-hundred bodies have been found thus far in Jonestown,
Guyana. Leader of the People’s Temple, Jim Jones…</p>
<p><strong>harvey’s pov</strong>: On City Hall’s lawn, Dan is with the
press. He looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window. They make eye
contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a relationship lost.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: It was a major decision on Friday that I
had to come… to arrive at. But since that time, people unknown to me,
plus my family and friends, have come to me and stated that they want me
to stay in office, that they support me… So I’m asking the Mayor to let
me stay in office to serve the people…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: He gets dragged into a closed door
meeting with the Police Officers Association, and comes out demanding
his job back? What do you think they promised him? Or worse, how did
they threaten him?</p>
<p><strong>mayor moscone</strong>: A man has the right to change his
mind. Give me some peace.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: How many of our propositions has Dan
shut down? We could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense.
Cement rent control. It’s his vote on this Board that stands in our
way.</p>
<p><strong>mayor moscone</strong>: I get it, Harvey. I’ve been lobbied
all week. Enough.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Let me just remind you that you’re up
for re-election. If you re- appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote. They
listen to me. You won’t get elected dog catcher.</p>
<p><strong>mayor moscone</strong>: I’ll make my decision on Monday. You
know what you sounded like just now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: A “homosexual” with a bit of power…
rather scary isn’t it, Mr. Mayor? OFF Harvey. He’s come a long way.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Yes. This is Dan White.</p>
<p><strong>kcbs reporter</strong>: I’m Barbra Taylor from KCBS. I’m
interested in your reaction. I’ve received information from the Mayor’s
office that you won’t be getting your job back.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t know anything about
that. Dan hangs up on her.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: Scott, half asleep.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Sorry to wake you up.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I went to the opera tonight. Guess who
my date was.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Bidu Sayao herself. She was in the
first Puccini I ever saw. The crowd went wild. It was like I was young
again, seeing my first live opera…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: If you go to the opera again, you
should call me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Really? Scott gets out of bed,
considers his words. It’s intimate.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Yes. I’d go with you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I’d like that. Harvey is quiet, a rare
moment of reflection. An unexpected tear rolls down his cheek.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Look out the window, the sun’s coming
up.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: It’s late. You should get some
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I don’t want to miss it.</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Miss what?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: This. Harvey’s single word answer
means, “Life.” OFF Harvey: Neither wants to hang up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, wait a minute, Mr.–</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: My aide was supposed to come down here
and let me in the side door, but she never showed up.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: I’m Dan White. City Supervisor. We follow
Dan down the hall and into the grand entry-way.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Who’s it gonna be? Is he replacing Dan
with that God Damned liberal lefty Don Horanzy? That’ll really shake up
the Board, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dianne feinstein</strong>: All I know is that we’re getting a
new Supervisor today. If Dan shows up, just avoid him. We don’t need a
scene today, right Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Heaven forbid, Dianne.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: You can’t take this away from me! Moscone
has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.</p>
<p><strong>mayor moscone</strong>: The issue is what’s fair, for the
people of your district. Take some time off. Spend it with your
family.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: This time next year we’re marching on
Washington D.C. It’ll look like Market and Castro, but with a million
people. Write that down. Tell President Carter we’re coming after him
next. I’m going to deposit this. I’ll be back in 20 minutes. Dan arrives
at Harvey’s office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND, preparing to leave,
surprised to see Dan in his doorway.</p>
<p><strong>dan white</strong>: Say, Harve, can I see you for a
minute?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Sure. Dan walks Harvey down the hall to
his old office.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Oh no… N– Dan Fires again, silencing
Harvey’s cry for help.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: Last week I got a phone call–</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: –from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the voice
was quite young, and the person said… “Thanks.” You’ve got to elect gay
people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him
know there’s hope… hope for a better world…</p>
<p><strong>scott smith</strong>: Where is everybody? Didn’t anyone give
a damn?</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: I ask this… If there should be an
assassination, I would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand
would rise. I would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect
come out–</p>
<p><strong>a massive candlelight march. cleve jones leads tens
of</strong>: THOUSANDS of San Franciscans of every religion,
nationality, sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones…
THEY ALL MARCH SILENTLY up Market Street to the palace Harvey dreamed
could be his own: City Hall.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –If a bullet should enter my brain, let
that bullet destroy every closet door… And that’s all. I ask for the
movement to continue. Because it’s not about personal gain, not about
ego, not about power… it’s about the “us’s” out there. Not only gays,
but the Blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us’s. Without
hope, the us’s give up– As the thousands of mourners arrive at City
Hall, they place their candles around the statue of Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: –I know you cannot live on hope alone,
but without it, life is not worth living. So you, and you, and you…</p>
<p><strong>harvey milk</strong>: You gotta give em’ hope… you gotta give
em’ hope. Harvey closes his note pad, puts down his pencil, and pushes
stop on his recorder.</p>
