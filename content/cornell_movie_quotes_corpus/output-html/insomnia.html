<p><strong>hap</strong>: Jesus. Just look at all that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t need to look at it.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Tell that to her, partner.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Detective?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Eleanor?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hey, Mr. Angstrom!</p>
<p><strong>mr. angstrom</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Police business.</p>
<p><strong>mr. angstrom</strong>: Police business?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom. Just
made detective three weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>mr. angstrom</strong>: Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down
at the station.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “Halibut fishing capital of the world.”</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: This ought to be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Detective Dormer!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My partner…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Detective Eckhart! I know! Welcome to
Nightmute!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I just want to say how incredible it is to
have you working with us, Detective Dormer. I’ve followed all your
cases. Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey Prud’homme, the Port Angeles
shootings…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Tell your dad the game’s gonna start late
this week, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sure thing, Spence.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You did your homework, Officer.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Actually…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I just made detective three weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Will Dormer!</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: I’ll be damned!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How you doing, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Hey, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Christ. I haven’t seen you boys
since…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just after Leland Street.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: What’s that, then?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Eight years.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Seven years.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Seven years? Where does it all go?
That was some amazing time, though, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You have, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: I knew that was coming. I deserve
it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: That’s all, for now.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh. Right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Nice kid.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Got a love affair with police work.
Drives me crazy with it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Keeping you busy up here, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: “2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch.”</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: I told you seven years ago this was a
stepping stone to retirement.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: What’s the D.A. got them on?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Four unwarranted shootings, witness
intimidation, and cocaine theft.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: How about you? How you faring?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: They’re all over us, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They’re all over everybody.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: I.A.’s calling themselves the “Corruption Task
Force.” Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or
“oversights” any other Detectives may have made over the years. They’re
turning it into a witch hunt. Something on the news about it practically
every night.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Got a bunch of messages here from some
guy named Warfield.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s I.A.’s pit bull.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Wants me to keep him posted on all
your movements up here.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Couldn’t get a thing from the body.
Not a trace. Town’s never dealt with anything like this before.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: This is Detective Dormer and his
partner Detective Eckhart. On loan from Buck Lundgard, Seattle Robbery
and Homicide Special Branch. They’ll be helping with the Connell
case.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Helping?</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Anything they need to see, you show
them; anywhere they want to go, you take them. This is Detective Fred
Duggar. He’s been leading the investigation up to now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Detective…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Suppose you want to see the body.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We can walk from here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Guess that’s what they call Alaskan
hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Don’t worry about him…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ellie! Go type something!</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Did a fundascopic examination and found
papilledema and petechiae of the retina.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Beaten to death.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Beaten to death.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What about these contusions?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Superficial.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Any signs of rape?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No fibers, skin flakes, hairs…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Like I said, no. We know about those things up
here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He knew exactly what we’d be looking for. Made
sure to cover up all his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Even the best make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Lower forty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Lower forty-eight?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re not from here. I can tell by your
walk.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Oh? And how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Unsure.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart. There
should be a reservation for us.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Your friend’s all business.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m always all business.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Alaskan summers. Hope you’re an easy
sleeper. It’ll be like this all night.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: See you have the same decor as my room.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: You know what about.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’ll talk when we get back to Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: When’s that, a week? Two weeks?… We have to
figure out a plan of action now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You know my plan of action.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: To do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Dammit, Will. Warfield had me locked up in his
office again for five hours yesterday. Five hours. Asking all kinds of
questions…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He’s asking everybody questions.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: But he’s zeroing in on me. On us. Everyone’s
talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He’s just rattling your cage.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Well, I gotta tell you. With a wife, three
kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it’s rattling hard.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We say nothing. It goes away. Simple as
that.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Look. We’ve tampered with evidence. We’ve
pushed witnesses. We’ve planted shit. And they’re sniffing around like
dogs. Especially on the Dobbs case…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and
left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. You remember
that?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: You know I remember that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: One word to I.A. and he walks.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Maybe not. We could talk to Buck…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that’s what
Flynn’s doing…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mike Flynn’s a dirty cop, Hap! We are nothing
like Mike Flynn. We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of-
bitch Dobbs paid for what he did. And every bastard like him. We say one
word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide
open and they’ll all walk. Every last one. And I am not going to let
that happen. No deals. No compromises. No discussions.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Goddammit, Will. You grab on to something and
you don’t let it go.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: I don’t know if it’s because you think it’s the
right thing to do or because your pride won’t let you do anything else.
I can’t tell any more. But I can tell you one thing. I’m getting too old
for this cowboy cop stuff. Breaking the rules. Cleaning up messes. We’re
a dying breed, Will. You’re a dying breed. I.A., the D.A., all those
reporters - they don’t care what you did at Leland Street seven years
ago. They don’t care that you’ve made this your life. They don’t care
about getting the bad guy…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I care.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Fred wants us to meet him at the
Connell’s.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Brought you a bear claw. Just in case you
were hungry.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Think I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh. You know. Small-time stuff. Nothing like
what you must get. Mostly drinking-related problems. Domestic abuse.
Barroom fights. Stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Don’t give misdemeanors a bad rap.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But they’re so boring. All small stuff.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s all about the small stuff. Small lies.
Small mistakes. Small oversights. People give themselves away in a
traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case. It’s human
nature.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Let me just…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. connell</strong>: I haven’t tidied up, since Fred told
me not to touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. connell</strong>: I don’t believe in keeping a child’s
room like a shrine.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Typical seventeen year-old. She went to a
party Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Down at a local dive the kids like to hang
out in.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No diary.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: She left the party early. Friends said she had
a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What time was that?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Around twelve-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who was the last one to see her alive?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We’ve questioned
him, searched his place. Didn’t find anything.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: These are designer. Expensive. Could Randy
Stetz afford these?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He fixes boat engines.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well her mother didn’t buy them for her.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: What are we thinking?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Kay Connell had an admirer.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You don’t seem all that sad.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I haven’t had a chance! You fuckers been all
over my back since Monday!</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: You know smoking stunts your growth.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Yeah, okay, fat-ass.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: More Alaskan hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you love her?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Kay Connell. Did you love her?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Sure. She was nice.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “She was nice.” Wow. That makes me all soft
inside. Ever occur to you she didn’t love you back?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You heard me that time.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: She loved me. She wanted to see me every
night.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But she was seeing someone else on the
side.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I don’t know what you’re fucking talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Friday night, at the party - what’d you fight
about?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Stuff.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What kind of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Just stuff. I don’t fucking remember.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The other guy?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I told you I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: After that she left the party to go to
him.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: How should I know?…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ran like hell to go to him…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Fuck you, man! - I’m sick of all your fucking
cop questions…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Now you listen to me, you little shit. This
fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma, but it
doesn’t work with me. You got mad at your girlfriend because she was
seeing someone else. You want to be the last person who saw her alive or
are you going to tell me who that is?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: She didn’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He’s a little surly, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I want you to check this out, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: We already did.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But there wasn’t any…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The small things - remember? The second you’re
about to dismiss something - look at it again.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You want me to write that down?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The bartender at Darrow’s. He was there
Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good. He’s up next.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Halibut Calabrese. Halibut Olympia. Halibut
Cajun Style. Halibut fish and chips…</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: At least there’s variety.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Looks like the natives are restless.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Will?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: I wish I could stick it out like you. I just,
with Trish and the kids…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Don’t do this, Hap…</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: I’m thinking I could get off with probation.
Keep half my pension. That’s all I want.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you’re
doing…</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: You don’t have to be involved, Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You tell Buck and I’m involved whether I like
it or not…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Ready to order?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Hey - you do everything around here?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Just about.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ll just have another Scotch in my room. If
you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’re sure it’s hers?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Has her books in it.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: What about prints?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Biology and Algebra.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: I read that kind of crap.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Read them. Tell me anything that strikes
you.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ll stick it in the evidence locker…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Uh, right. About two miles outside of
town.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: On the beach.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Why are we taking it back?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This murder was in the papers, right?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yeah. All over.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell
them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue
knapsack, but we haven’t recovered it yet. We can get it in by the
morning editions.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Nice. Lighter than I remembered.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Glock 40. All plastic save the barrel and
firing pin. Never rusts. What do you carry down in Seattle?</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Smith and Wesson 45.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Brought some coffee…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I told her to come.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Anything yet?</p>
<p><strong>will fred</strong>: Nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Maybe this guy doesn’t read the papers.</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: Or goes straight to the Sports Section.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I see someone!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: He’s bolting!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Police!</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Sorry about…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dammit, Ellie!…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hap!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hap!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dormer…</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: And then you lost him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And then I lost him. In the fog.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: About how long ’til you heard the
suspect’s second shot?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Twenty, thirty seconds. I followed the sound
down to the water. That’s where…</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: I think you need a glass of this.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why didn’t I know about that goddamn tunnel,
Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: There’s a bunch of those tunnels out
there, Will. From bunkers over sixty years old. I don’t even know half
of them myself, and I grew up here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I had him, Charlie. Right in front of me. Not
two feet. I could smell the son- of-a-bitch. Playing with me. And I
missed the shot. He was right there and I missed the shot! Then my
goddamned gun jammed…</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Will, you can’t blame yourself.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I had him!</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: It’s only gonna make you crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Right, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But what about the Connell case? I’m on the
Connell case.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: We need paperwork, Ellie. You know
that. Just write up a quick report.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m going to check on the roadblocks…</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: You’re no good right now, Will. Go
back to the Lodge. Try to get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: …earlier this evening after an aborted
attempt to apprehend a suspect. He was forty-five…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sorry about your partner.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You were nice to him. He liked you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Pioneer Lodge?… Hold on a second. He’s right
here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dormer.</p>
<p><strong>warfield’s voice</strong>: Detective Dormer. I’ve been trying
to reach you. I was very sorry to hear about your partner, Detective
Eckhart. It must have been a terrible shock, what happened this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s not exactly how I’d put it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do you mean, “Funny?”</p>
<p><strong>warfield’s voice</strong>: Oh, nothing. Just that I felt
Detective Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting to make a real
connection before you left. I sensed that he was ready to get some
things off his chest. Did you sense anything like that, Detective? I
mean, as his partner?…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You know why everyone hates you, Warfield?
It’s not your questions, it’s not your press conferences, it’s not even
your cheap suits; everyone hates you ’cause day after day you suck the
marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one
yourself. Well I got to tell you, it’s a shame you’re not up here with
me because I’d love to show you right now just what a real cop is
capable of. You just remember that when you’re sitting at your bullshit
desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: They’re watching us, Will…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hap!</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: …We’re going to bring down a couple of
guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to step up the investigation
here…</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: …Nightmute hasn’t lost an officer in
thirty-seven years, and even though Detective Eckhart wasn’t from here,
he was as good as one of us on this case. I had the honor of working
with him down in Seattle for a number of years. He was a fine detective
and an even better man.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Okay. Then let’s get to it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Detective Dormer?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s good to be accurate, Ellie. You’re doing
your job.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m so sorry about what happened. I know you
did everything you could…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I was here.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dormer. Still no sign of the bullet that went
through Farrell.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m going to the hospital to talk to him now.
You get the search party together. No fewer than thirty people. I’ll
meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes. Don’t waste any time.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Partner or no partner. That guy’s a prick.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He has to be a prick, Fred. He’s a great
detective.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Detective Dormer!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Oh, a real tear-jerker. Brody, the good
guy, just got shot.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: I wish I’d had the chance to get to know
him better. Take him fishing or something.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He would have liked that.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: We just gotta catch the bastard, right?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s why I’m here. I need to know exactly
what you saw yesterday, Farrell.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: What I saw?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Anything. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Pretty much nothing. That fog was so thick.
The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere. I don’t even remember seeing
any shapes. Then I saw you. But only when you came up close. Then you
disappeared again. I guess I heard more than I saw.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. No. Don’t be sorry. It’s not your
fault.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Time for your meds.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Lonnie and I went to high school
together.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Just take the pills, Farrell.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How’s the leg?</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Oh, you know. Don’t feel that much. Bullet
went right through.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Right. Got lost in the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: We’ll get the other one, though.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: …and it was at this point that Detective
Dormer headed towards the noise…</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re supposed to be Farrell. Shot in the
thigh and writhing in pain.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: C’mon, Ellie. What’s it matter?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Accuracy. That’s what. Now get down.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: …shortly after hearing the second shot,
Detective Dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body,
lying approximately fifteen feet away.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yeah. And I’m freezing my nads off!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Ellie! Think I found something!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: …Anything catches your eye, you put it in a
bag. Anything looks strange, you put it in a bag…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Detective?</p>
<p><strong>burly guy #1</strong>: Where do you want us?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The woods. One group heading south, the other
heading north.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Make sure they’re set to channel 6…</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: We did the interviews with all the
nearby houses like you asked.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Here’s a list of who we talked to.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Alright. Go back and set up some follow- ups
for this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You don’t think they should start further
back?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He had to have exited here. Over those
boulders. I saw him move, he’s nimble. Would have taken the hardest way
out.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Duggar…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Here. It’s on the house.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I got it. Don’t know why I bother. It’s been
broken for two years.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Habit.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Fred Duggar?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No. He didn’t say what his name was. Only
that you were expecting him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m not expecting anyone.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s not what he thinks.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What did he look like?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Short. Dark hair. Not that memorable.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I need to borrow something.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I could say the same thing about you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh. We always have play-offs in the middle of
the night. It’s the best time.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who’s playing?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The Puffins and the Hawks. We’re in extra
innings. The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s my sister.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She your only sibling?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Twelve years younger.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. Well. I had a brother. He died when I was
eleven.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, I shouldn’t have…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s okay. Happened a long time ago. He was
killed in a fire. In New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That must have been awful for you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Not really. I remember I was more embarrassed
that he had died. Embarrassed that it made me different. So I didn’t
tell the other kids at school what had happened. They’d ask me where he
was, where he’d gone. And I’d make up stories. He was visiting an aunt
up north, he’d broken his leg, he was in a Swiss boarding school. Stuff
like that. Nice kid, huh? Just kept making up more and more lies…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need
to go through some of Kay Connell’s school records.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Officer!…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ll pick it up. You head back to the
station.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Duggar - I’m at the coroner’s now. I’ll be
back in about twenty minutes…</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Detective. Thought you were sending one of
your lackeys.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I thought it was better if I came. Under the
circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: It’s different when you know them, isn’t
it? Just sign over there and she’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Your partner didn’t suffer much…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: You’re looking a little green,
Detective.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So where’s the other bullets?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s with all the moose antlers around
here?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Lots of moose.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: When’s Rich coming?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ll call him now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: First I need a copy of the key.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: This isn’t Seattle, Detective. We don’t have
copies. This is the only one.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Detective Dormer? Telephone.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: This came for you earlier.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dormer.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I bet you haven’t been getting much
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: You lower-48s. You think the white
nights are kind of neat. Then you can’t sleep for days. I’ve seen it
happen about a million times. But you can’t sleep for a different
reason.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I said, who is this?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I saw what really happened, Will…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I saw you kill your partner. With your
back-up weapon. Out there on the beach. I saw you shoot him dead…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Now you listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone. Oh,
and I saw you take my gun. My uncle’s old 357. I dropped it in the
rocks. But you can go ahead and keep that.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Detective Dormer!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You look like you’re in a hurry. I just
wanted to ask you about these pictures.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But here’s the thing. I retraced your exact
steps according to your statement. You couldn’t have seen Detective
Eckhart from there. I mean, not in that fog.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Then change it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How much closer would you say you were?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Five feet? Seven feet?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Listen, Ellie. I don’t have time for this
shit. Five feet, seven feet, twenty feet. Put down whatever you want in
your report, alright?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dormer…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: These should have gone out two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: …And that’s how I think Kay would want
us to remember her…</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: …And always, always with a smile on her
face.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Want one?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You go ahead. I’ll be there in a second.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why don’t I give her a ride?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Thought I smelled something.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good to see you, too, Randy.</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Who’re you?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Fuckin’ cop.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: You coming or not?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: I never met anyone from Seattle before.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re not missing much.</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: What are you doing in this shit-hole
town?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You were good friends with Kay Connell,
weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: I was her best friend.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Best friend?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Since grade school.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s a long time.</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: We were like sisters. Knew everything about
each other.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Must be tough for you. What happened.</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Everybody says I’m holding up great,
considering. Don’t even care if I go to school. They’re all worried I
haven’t cried yet.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What about Kay’s other friends?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Do we have to talk about Kay? I don’t want to
talk about her right now. Let’s just drive. Go somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You want me to take you somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Long as it’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How about this. You like this?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thought you wanted something fun…</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Move over!</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: You crazy son-of-a-bitch! You could have
killed us!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You and Kay were like sisters?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Told each other everything. That why your
picture’s torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: She wouldn’t tell me!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But you were such good friends…</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: It was like some big fucking secret!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What was?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: She kept saying she was gonna get out of
here. Leave us all behind. That he was going to take her!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: My arm!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: She used some stupid code name.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Brody…I don’t know… …Something Brody!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Lucy. Desi.</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Now you’re mad at me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Forget your pager?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I beeped you over two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: And something else that might interest
you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: One of the paperbacks we found in Kay
Connell’s knapsack.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.
It’s signed. Personally.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: This is a local writer. Kay had all his books.
I think we should check it out.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t think it’ll lead anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Are you alright? You popped out from
nowhere!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: He okay?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I don’t think you should move.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: You sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Careful not to bleed on my interior.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Walter Byrd.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: When I was seven my mother and grandmother
took me to Vancouver. We were walking along the street one day when
these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother’s purse right from
under her arm. Right from under her arm. That night a police officer
came to our hotel room to ask us questions. Stood the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know this glacier moves a quarter of an
inch every day?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You think this is a nice meeting we’re having
here? Friendly? Two people getting acquainted? You sick, coward, fuck. I
get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down.
Beating a seventeen year- old girl to death. Washing her afterwards,
cleaning her. Make you feel like a real man? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I stood right behind you…I saw you look
right into his eyes and shoot him…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That was an accident! You hear me? I didn’t
know it was him! I didn’t know it was him!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then why lie about it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s your game, Byrd?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No game.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The phone call. The knapsack.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I figured we’re partners on this one. I
mean, after what I saw…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Let’s get one thing straight, Byrd. We are
partners on nothing.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I research my novels. I know the procedures.
You’d have cuffed me back at the ferry. You’d have called for back- up,
read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment. You’re
a well-respected detective. There’s no reason for you to be talking to
me right now…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re going to get a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I said you’re going to get a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your
books.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thought you might find that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re going to be brought in for
questioning.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Down at the station?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes down at the station.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Okay. Okay. Brought in for questioning.
Good. I can write this.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do you mean, “wild card?”</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Next ferry’s in forty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do you mean “wild card?”</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’ll know. At the questioning.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Full up.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have a cold.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Which way are you walking?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Back to the Lodge.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I needed to get your signature on
something.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Duggar called him?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: About an hour ago. Said he was more than
happy to cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Isn’t that the difference between a good cop
and a bad cop? A good cop can’t sleep ’cause a piece of the puzzle’s
missing. A bad cop can’t sleep ’cause his conscience won’t let him. You
said that once, remember?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. But it sounds like something I would’ve
said.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh! I forgot to tell you. The Puffins
won.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch…</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: …I saw you look right into his eyes
and shoot him…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Goddammit, Byrd!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’d have done the same thing, Will. I know
you would…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I didn’t know!</p>
<p><strong>hap</strong>: You sure about that, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Detective Dormer?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Will…I…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There’s a guy down the hall. Complaining
about the noise. Says he can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Did something happen?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Will…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The light. It keeps coming in…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There was this guy named Weston Dobbs.
Twenty-four. Worked as a part-time stock boy in a copy store. Every
morning he’d sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight
year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street. And every
afternoon he’d watch the boy get dropped off again. He did this for
about six months. Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street
and grab the boy before his carpool came. Kept him in his apartment for
three days. Tortured him. Raped him. Made him do things…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: One of your cases?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Me and Hap. A year and a half ago. I knew the
second I met Dobbs that he was guilty. Smug, cold. Dead eyes. We had
circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it. Nothing concrete.
Went over every inch of that apartment.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We took some blood samples from the boy’s body
and planted them in his apartment. Arrested him the next day.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There’ve been other cases. Where we’ve changed
results. Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence. But Dobbs. I wanted
Dobbs more than anything.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What if someone finds out?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’re under investigation now. Back in
Seattle. Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got back. Thought he could
work out some kind of deal.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, that’s not going to happen now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do you think it was wrong? What we did?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There are two kinds of people in Alaska.
Those who were born here and those who’ve come here to escape something
in their lives. I wasn’t born here, Will. I’m in no position to judge
anyone. I’m not about that any more.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You were acquainted with the deceased, Kay
Connell?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes I was.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: In what manner?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She was, not quite a “fan.” More an avid
reader of my detective novels.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: When did you first meet her?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A year ago. At one of my signings.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Where you signed this?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What happened at that signing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She flattered me about my writing. Asked if
she could visit me. To talk about my books.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Did she?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Not that much at first. But then she
became more comfortable. Started visiting me every week…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What was the nature of your relationship?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What do you mean, Detective Dormer?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She was an attractive girl. Did you have sex
with her?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She was only seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But she was an attractive girl.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you have sex with her?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But you wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was a mentor to her.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You gave her gifts.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Expensive dresses. A heart necklace.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Doesn’t sound like a mentor to me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I gave her things she didn’t have. Couldn’t
have.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We understand, Mr. Byrd. You want to sit down,
Detective?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She wasn’t happy. I was someone to talk
to.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That boyfriend. Randy.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Randy Stetz?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He. Well, he…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Mr. Byrd. Anything you can tell us could help
out with this case.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well. He hit her.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Are you sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She’d come to me, sometimes in the middle of
the night. Bruises all over her back, her upper arms. I pled with her to
let me call the police, but she wouldn’t hear it. Wanted to keep it a
secret.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He has a terrible rage. Kay even said he
carried a handgun around with him.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Margaret! Get Judge Biggs on the phone! I’ll
get another warrant for Stetz’s place.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Could I have some more coffee, Detective
Burr?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: You can’t fucking do this!</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Hey! I’m working on that!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Found something.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: What the fuck is that!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s it. Let’s bag it.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: That’s not mine, man! That’s not mine!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Randy…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: No way, man!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: C’mon, Randy.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I swear to God. I didn’t kill her. I swear to
God…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You look like shit, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s an understatement.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Looks like we can wrap this one up.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: I can’t believe it. Randy Stetz.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: What do you mean, you can’t believe it?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: He was an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: That doesn’t mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Didn’t you grow up with him?</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Our dads were on the same boat. We used to
wait for them together.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: He used to pick fights at the gas
station.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: And remember when he did all those donut holes
that one summer?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Just a bad seed.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: How do you like our beer?</p>

shut-eye.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: The white nights been hard on you?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They haven’t been easy.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: They don’t have titanium shades over at the
Pioneer.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Well no wonder.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You lose all sense of time.</p>
<p><strong>farrell</strong>: Better than Fred’s home town.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: My people are from Barrow. Way up north.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: In the winter there’s no sunlight for five
straight months.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Like being swallowed up in a black hole.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Nancy Drew! Pull up a seat!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You hear what happened, Ellie?</p>

<p><strong>farrell</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Shell casing. 9mm.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Let it go, Ell. We got the bad guy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon. And the
murder weapon was a 357.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Get a hobby, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s a legitimate point, isn’t it, Detective
Dormer?</p>

<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi, Will…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What the hell are you doing calling me at the

<p><strong>walter</strong>: I figured we should touch base. Compare
notes. I think it went well. What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Randy Stetz is in jail.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Told you I could write an ending.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I thought maybe we could talk some more.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There’s nothing more to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But we work so well together…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We do nothing well together. Nothing! You
understand me?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You run on two settings, Will. I’ve noticed
that…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What the hell do you know?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Kay told me. She comes to me, you know.
Tells me things. About you. About me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I told you that was an accident!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then so was mine…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Don’t you pull that shit with me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I didn’t want to kill her, Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Couldn’t get it up, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It was when I went to kiss her. She started
laughing. I got angry. After all I’d given her. All I’d shared with her.
I just wanted to make her stop. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Like that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This an accident, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If you want it to be…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to
death. Ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake. I’m
going to write my next novel there. It’s about a famous detective who
goes bad.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: I was hoping not to send you back with
so much paperwork, Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Six-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: If Spencer’s not too drunk to fly.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Can’t talk you into staying for a
couple of days? Do some fishing? Show you what normally goes on around
here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have to get back.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Too bad…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Had a lot of help from Nightmute’s finest.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Didn’t want to miss anything.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Detective Dormer’s not leaving for a
few hours.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>chief nyback</strong>: Maybe you could drive him to
Spencer’s.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I found a new friend.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Very funny, Farrell…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hi, Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I would have seen if he came back.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Detective Dormer?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What is all this?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Here to visit me?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Where’s your back-up?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No back-up.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re not following procedure.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Procedure went out the window a long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We’re on the same side, Will. You know that.
After what we’ve been through together. We’re partners. Bound by a
secret.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s where you’re wrong, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Will…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You give the police a bad name, Will.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wild card.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Drop the gun, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That jammed the last time, remember?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Another J. Brody mystery.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Detective Dormer!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: God, you’re a pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re shot.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m going to make a tourniquet.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell. Her things are
in the house.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Byrd’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You shot Detective Eckhart, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Did you mean to?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. But I covered it up. I lied.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Because I just couldn’t be wrong. Don’t ever
get that way, Ellie. Don’t ever lose your way. It blurs the line.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This one looks worse.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just let me sleep, Ellie…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What about your shoulder?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll have a cool scar.</p>
