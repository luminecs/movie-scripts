<p><strong>girl</strong>: Is it you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Your Highness!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight
of you, my lord. For though my father, the Duke, has promised you my
hand, I cannot consent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land
from highest hill to deepest dale is …</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: … from highest hill to deepest dale …
Damn!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get off me, you monster!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you’ll
hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh no, Merlin! We’re really late! Why does
everything have to happen to me!!!?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s all your fault, you miserable mutt!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: <em>Sarah</em>, where have you been?!!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to
baby-sit for Freddie! Don’t we at least deserve an explanation?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: As Meander’s Queen, I’ve been … meandering.
Dither me not about explanations.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What’s that all about?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s a part in a play, but that’s no reason
to…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Chasten not your Queen, <em>Peasant</em>!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: <em>Sarah</em>, that’s no way to talk to
your mother!</p>
<p><strong>stepmother</strong>: <em>Sarah</em>, when I tell you to be
home at five, I expect you to be home at five.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes, Madame!</p>
<p><strong>stepmother</strong>: And don’t “Yes Madame” me!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>stepmother</strong>: Oh! I give up!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: We’ll see you later, baby. And remember
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah &amp; father</strong>: Don’t open the door to
strangers.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And don’t call me baby! Precious little
Freddie might be coming down with a cold …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight
of you, my Lord …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s Lancelot?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s my bear?!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Nobody listens to a thing I say.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How many times have I told them to stay out
of my room …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And you, you can just give me back my
bear!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re the only one who understands me,
Merlin.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight
of you, my lord …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Go to sleep, Freddie!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why does everything have to happen to me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t need this.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There, isn’t that nice …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Want your nice toy?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You know, Freddie, I heard that the only
thing to do with a baby who won’t stop crying is to get some goblins to
come over and teach him a lesson …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How would you like that, kid? A nasty evil
goblin …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, you like that, do you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ah, c’mon, Freddie. It was just a song.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams …
Sarah Williams, the actress?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Allow me to introduce myself … I’m Robin
Zaker.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You wrote the play!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand
you make a delightful Queen Meander.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, we’ve just started rehearsal, but how
did you know?</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: I was passing through this part of the
country and heard that it was going to be done here. This is the first
amateur production of the play, which of course is delightful for
me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You know we were supposed to open tonight,
but we got delayed. The firemen had to use the hall.</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: Yes, I know, that’s why I wanted to stop by
to see you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s my brother …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ll be right back!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, Freddie …</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: Perhaps I can soothe him …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You shouldn’t be up here!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Maybe you’d better leave …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … I, uh, don’t think I care to talk to you
about the play.</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: I’m more concerned about the baby, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Freddie’s just fine.</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: There, isn’t that better?</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: I’m not just a playwright, as you can see …
bring him in here and I’ll do some other tricks for him …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No! You’ve got to …</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: Now watch this, Freddie …</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: So you’re going to be like that, are you,
Freddie? Well, you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: It’s time to call the goblins!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?!!</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: Yes. That’s what we do with bad babies … we
send for the goblins!!</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: You like goblins, don’t’cha, Freddie? but I
bet your sister doesn’t …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where is it?!!!</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: It’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: See for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How did you do that?!!</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: Magic.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh sure …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s Freddie?!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Freddie?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where is he?!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Who are you?!!!</p>
<p><strong>zakar</strong>: I’ve been known by many names … but the one I
prefer is <em>Jareth, King of the Goblins</em>!!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t believe this!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: An’ how’s me pride an’ joy!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: What is this? Look what you done! You
murderer!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What are you saying, you horrible little
man?!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I ain’t horrible, I’m <em>Hoggle</em>. And
just look! You’ve destroyed me prize blossoms!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I’ll get ya for it, you big oaf!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh no you don’t! If anyone’s getting anything
around here, it’s me … now where’ my brother?!!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I ain’t sayin’ nothin’ ’til ye let me
go!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry. But this just hasn’t been my
day.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Ye ain’t the only one.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And I don’t understand any of this!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Now where have I heard that before.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I mean, everyone who comes here thinkin’
they can make it through the labyrinth says sumthin’ like … I don’t
understand this, whatever am I doing here, how will I ever get home
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What makes you think I’m here to get through
a labyrinth?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Can’t think of any reason why you’d be
standin’ here in front o’ this gate if you weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, no! Not more goblins!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: That’s Jareth’s goblin army, and that other
poor fool musta been caught meanderin’ where he had no business.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What will they do to him?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I don’t like to think about things like
that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I wonder if things can get any worse?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: He’s taken sumthin’ o’ yours, ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Jareth, our high an’ mighty king …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Bet he’s gone and taken sumthin’ you
love.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Baby snatchin’! That’s low.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So I’ve just got to do something!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get Freddie back, of course!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Then ya’d have ta make it through the
labyrinth, ’cause Jareth’s castle is at its very center.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Is it difficult?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look, I’m sorry about your bush! But it’s not
like I asked to have some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then
drop me out of the sky!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Well, I didn’t ask for some overgrown flower
fairy to drop on me prized possession, neither!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, this is ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: That ain’t the only way in, ya know!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s not?!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Course it ain’t. There’s many a route in …
just only one way out.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well show me one! I’ve got to find my
brother!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Information like that has a price …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I could give you this …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I had sumthin’ o’ this caliber in mind …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. My mother gave me that.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: She could give ya another …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, she couldn’t. She lives real far away
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This is all you get.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Bah! It’s paste!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No it’s not, it’s plastic.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What a beautiful little thing …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Let me at it!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful
creatures?!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It bit me!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Of course it bit ya! There’s nuthin’ more
vicious than a flower fairy. Any fool knows that!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I got a feelin’ I’m gonna regret this. Come
with me an’ I’ll show ya a way in.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: This’ll take ya into the maze, that’s the
first part of the labyrinth …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The first part! What comes after that?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Then there’s the Garden Maze, then the
Forbidden Forest …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That sounds inviting …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Wait! Wait! I can’t hear you …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: … then comes the castle …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: … that’s surely where Jareth’s keepin’ the
babe …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Ya don’t seem ta be able ta do nuthin’
without my help, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this
place doesn’t seem so bad at all.</p>
<p><strong>face</strong>: Go back! Go back before it’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>face 2</strong>: Turn back while you still can!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hoggle!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, I’m so glad you’re still here! They were
horrible …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: You don’t mean the False Alarms, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: If ya gonna let a little thing like them
scare ya, Missy, ya haven’t a hope o’ makin’ it to the castle.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: False Alarms?</p>
<p><strong>face 1</strong>: This is the path of no return!</p>
<p><strong>face 2</strong>: Beware! Beware!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Just ignore ’em.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>face 3</strong>: Abandon all hope …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Oh, shut up, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>face 3</strong>: But I was just getting to the best part!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: All right. But don’t expect us to pay any
attention.</p>
<p><strong>face 3</strong>: Come back any time … I mean, you’re doomed,
doomed!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Ya see, things aren’t always what they
appear to be around here, Missy …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I admire yer determination, but it takes
more’n that to beat Jareth.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, maybe I’m beginning to get the hang of
this labyrinth business.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: See, now I’ll know which way we came in case
I get lost.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look, Hoggle! I’ve got to find Freddie and I
don’t need you to discourage me!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: And I don’t need to be wastin’ me time goin’
around in circles with you!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s fine with me! I know you’re only after
my ring, anyway!</p>
<p><strong>brickkeeper</strong>: Some people got no respect for
property!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: But …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … but you were just behind me! I’m sure of
it!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: My mark! It was right here!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I told ya, Missy. Things aren’t what they
appear to be around here …</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Except when they are.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: We meet again … Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s Freddie?!! What have you done with
him!?</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Nothing … yet.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: And what have we here … Hoghead, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Me name’s Hoggle.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Ah, yes. Now I remember. You’re the greedy
little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldn’t you be back there
minding your own business … Hedgehog?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why, why don’t you pick on someone your own
size?</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Whom did you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t have time for any games. I want
Freddie, and I want him now!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. I’m
really growing rather fond of him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where is he?!!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: He’s in my castle, and seems to be enjoying
himself immensely.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: In fact, he likes being with goblins so
much, I’m considering turning him into one.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Can he?</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: But let’s make it interesting. I won’t do it
for … thirteen hours. If you make it to the castle before then you might
be able to save him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an
adorable goblin prince, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Well, good riddance to bad rubbish!</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: That’s what the missus always says, she does.
Why the last time she found that one around here she sent him
packing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jareth?!</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: She don’t take to his kind of nonsense, that’s
for sure. Now, how about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle
on.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if
I make it on time?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: It’s hard to say, Missy. But if I were you,
I’d worry ’bout first things first.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I means ya got ta find the castle before ya
can go savin’ the babe and I mean ta see that ya do!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, Hoggle! Thank you, thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Seems to me I could be gettin’ that ring
from ya after all if I plays me cards right.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know you don’t mean that. You’re helping me
because you’re really nice.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I ain’t nice! I just likes the way ya stood
up ta him is all. Too bad more’ve us haven’t had the guts to do the
same.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: How about a biscuit? The missus just took a
fresh batch out of the oven.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thanks, but we really don’t have any time.
We’ve got to get to the castle.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Ya wouldn’t happen to know a shortcut, would
ya?</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Well, you might try taking that first
left.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: But there isn’t any left turn.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: See, there’s a left turn right there, where
that Wise One just came in.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A Wise One! Maybe he knows the best way to
the castle!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Excuse me, Sir. Could you tell us the best
way to get to the castle?</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: The best way to the castle, hmmm. I’m glad
you asked that question.</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Now you’ve done it, gone and asked him a
question. We’ll be here all day!</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: A castle, or fortress, or as it is
sometimes known, a stronghold or citadel – or, that which has a turret
and barbican, but usually not a portcullis …</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: What did I tell you? There’s no stopping him
now.</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: … often there is a rampart or bulwark, and
then a parapet – perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp …</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Shut up down there!</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: … and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge
and sally-port …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This was not one of my better ideas.</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Well, I told you that, didn’t I? But nobody
ever listens to me!</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Enough! Nobody cares!!</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: Did one of you say something?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers.</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: That’s very wise. An idea worth
savoring.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Yeah, but keep it under your hat!</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Ve-ry funny!</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: The stranger, hmm. I’m glad you brought
that up. The stranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or
one from beyond the sea …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How did he do that?!!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: And how can we make sure he doesn’t come
back?</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Just go over to that bit of wall there and
walk right through it. The important thing is to forget what you think
you know. It doesn’t apply around here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thank you! And tell the missus we’re sorry we
missed her biscuits!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Come on, Hoggle. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>female goblin</strong>: Remember! It’s bow and scrape … bow
and scrape …</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Well, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>stupid goblin</strong>: … bow ’n scrape … bow ’n scrape …</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: I said, what is it?!!!</p>
<p><strong>stupid goblin</strong>: Th … the girl and Hoggle, sire. Th …
they’re halfway th …. through th … the maze.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: I think it’s time they had some company.</p>
<p><strong>armed goblin</strong>: Yes, Sir!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: You’ll make a much better goblin than that,
won’t you, Freddie!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a
goblin? I mean, that’s really weird …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>goblin 1</strong>: I can kill better than you can.</p>
<p><strong>goblin 2</strong>: But I’m better at maiming. Everybody says
so.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do you think they’re gone?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Sure they are. Goblins ain’t known fer their
intelligence, ya know. They has as much trouble findin’ their way
through the maze as you do.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not sure, but I think you just called me
stupid …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’ll be a nice change.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: This place is the end o’ the maze! That
means we’re near the entrance ta the second ring o’ the labyrinth.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The second ring? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Don’t know, I ain’t never made it this far
before.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Now don’t go gettin’ all girly on me, Missy,
now that we’s finally safe …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So you think we’re safe, do you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Then tell me what you think of that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hoggle, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: None of the keys work!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Why don’t you just try it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s open! Hog …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Only 9 hours left!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hoggle!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Missy! Over here! This is the way to the
castle!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What happened to you? I was afraid I’d never
see you again!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if
it don’t work with the floor, as well!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: An hour’s gone by and I don’t think we’re
more than four feet from where we started.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: That’s ‘cause ya won’t do what I tells ya.
It’s clear as day we should be goin’ this way …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Got any more suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It sounds like it came from over there!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Then let’s go this way.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hoggle! It sounds like someone’s being
hurt!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Exactly why we should be headin’ in the
othermost direction!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The poor thing!</p>
<p><strong>blinded goblin</strong>: Hey! Who turned out the lights?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get out here, you coward!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … hurt.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Is that your name? Ludo?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Goblins … mean to Ludo.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you.
But it’s all right now.</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Friend!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s right, Ludo! I’m your friend. I’m
Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Sarah … friend!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I think I’m about ta be sick.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I hope yer not thinkin’ o’ lettin’ the beast
traipse along, Missy. He’ll just slow us up.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you kidding?! He’ll be a great help! The
goblins are scared of him because he’s so fierce …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I just thinks we was doin’ fine on our
own.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And we can do even better with Ludo. You want
to help me save my baby brother, don’t you, Ludo?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Save … baby. Good!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden
Forest. All we gotta do is pick a door …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What difference does it make? Let’s just
go!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: One door … good. One door … bad.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Well, that’s great news. Don’t suppose ya
know which is which?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: One door … good. One door …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: All right, ya walkin’ mountain! Ya made ya
point.</p>
<p><strong>knocker 1</strong>: Are you addressing me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You can talk!</p>
<p><strong>knocker 1</strong>: What? What? You’ll have to speak up!!</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: mmffn … grnth … sminvl …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You too!</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: … gmft … bmble …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: If yer so smart why not show us another way
inta the forest?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … not … know.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: That figures, don’t it? Why the Missy wants
an overgrown hill o’ hair fer a friend is beyond me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I love it! Talking doors!! Are you the right
door to the forest?</p>
<p><strong>knocker 1</strong>: It doesn’t do to ask me. For some reason
I can’t hear a thing.</p>
<p><strong>knocker 1</strong>: No use asking him, either. All he does is
mumble.</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: thgt … vrnf … lcl …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I get it! You can’t talk with that ring in
your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Now, tell me which one of you is the right
door to the forest.</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: Oh, I am. No question about it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Great! How do we get you to open up?</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: One merely has to knock.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Of course, why didn’t I think of that.</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: Oh no you don’t, young lady! I’ve had
just about enough of that awful thing, thank you very much!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: But how are we supposed to get through this
door if you won’t let me knock on it?</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: Well, I really couldn’t say now, could
I?</p>
<p><strong>knocker 1</strong>: Oh do speak up, both of you? I can’t hear
a thing!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … Stay!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Yer quite the speechifier, ain’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you sure there isn’t anything I can do to
change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>knocker 2</strong>: Absolutely not! My lips are sealed!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s what I thought!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Now you’ve done it!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Missy! Missy, wait!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I’m coming …</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Sarah … gone. Hoggle … gone.</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: This ought to be a good one!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … need … door!</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes.
A very useful thing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold – and
that which gives access, a gate or gangway …</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: … also an entrance or entry, often
accompanied by a propylaeum …</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: … not to be confused with a window, or
fenestration …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hoggle, Ludo … where are you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, Freddie! Well, you guys are going to have
to catch up with me ’cause I can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Somebody help me! I can’t swim!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why does everything have to happen to me?</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: We’re Wild Things, baby! Wild!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: Wild and free!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 3</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: You call that wild! I’ll show you
wild!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: Cut me some slack and move on
back!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: Snake eyes!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 3</strong>: That’s it, baby, get wild and free!
But you’ll never be as wild as me!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: I wouldn’t call that really
<em>wild</em>, would you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, it’s … uh … sort of …</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: I’d call <em>this</em> wild …</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: That was <em>wild</em>, baby. Now how
‘bout gettin’ wild with me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I think I’ll sit this one out …</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: Not with us you don’t …</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: ’Cause we’re <em>wild</em>!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Enough! I’ve got to find the castle!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: Well, why didn’t you say so, baby!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 3</strong>: That’s a <em>wild</em> idea!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: They got some wild goings on at the
castle, baby!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Well, what have we here … if it isn’t little
<em>Piggle</em>!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Did the girl decide she doesn’t need you,
now that she has that beast?</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Don’t you know she could never care for a
repulsive thing like you!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: She does care! Me ’n Sarah is friends!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Only until something better comes along …
and I’ve definitely got something better in mind!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Don’t you hurt her!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: What I do to her is my business … and it is
<em>inevitable</em>.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: You can be with me or against me.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in
time …</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: But just in case, I want you to deliver her
to me.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Never! I’d rather die!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Then so you shall.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I gotta know what … what you’ll do to
her!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: I will do what ever amuses me …</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: All <em>you</em> have to do is give her
this.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: You’ve made a very wise decision.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I didn’t decide nuthin’!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you sure this is the way to the
castle?</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: Oh, did you say “the castle”?</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: I thought she said hassle!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 3</strong>: I thought she said rassle!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 1</strong>: Rassle! That’s a <em>wild</em>
idea!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: OK, guys, fun’s over.</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 2</strong>: Over! It’s just begun!</p>
<p><strong>wild things 1, 2 &amp; 3</strong>: Now this is
<em>really</em> wild!</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: … very often preceded by a porch, or
portico, also verandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as
an antechamber or foyer …</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Why me?!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ludo!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Sarah … not … want … castle?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!!</p>
<p><strong>wild thing 3</strong>: Hey, big fella! That’s a little
<em>too</em> wild …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, Ludo! I’m so glad you’re here!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s Hoggle?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Hoggle … in … bad … door.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’ve got to find him! Do you think we
can?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … knows … doors …</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: also … portal … or entrance …</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Hoggle … all … wet.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Ain’t that the clever observation, ya feeble
excuse fer a thinkin’ creature!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we won’t get you out.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Missy!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It doesn’t look too strong but we don’t have
much choice …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent
…</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the
point of my sword!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Please, we really have to cross this bridge.
It’s a matter of life and death!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Under any other circumstances I would
hasten to oblige you, fair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy
one.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, it is!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none
may pass.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Rapscallions! Duel … or <em>die</em>!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: What <em>is</em> this weasel babblin’
about?</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who
dealt me the gravest affront!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a
truly noble knight.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Destroy me if you will.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Never have I met my match in battle, yet
you, noble knight, have fought me to a standstill.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight
for the right as one!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … get … brother!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, now that that’s settled let’s get
going.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: You forget my sacred vow, my lady. I cannot
let you pass.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: But you said Ludo was your brother! How can
you refuse him?!!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: I have taken an oath. I must defend it to
the death.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Some brother he turned out ta be!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Brother … good!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Well, if he’s so good, why won’t he let us
get on with our business?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: OK, let’s handle this thing logically. What
exactly have you sworn?</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: I have sworn with my life-blood, no one
shall pass this way without my permission.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Then may we … <em>have your
permission</em>?</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained
mammoth!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: I, Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the
actions of my brother, my lady. Lash out at me if you must.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus. I’m just
upset because time is running out and I have to rescue my baby
brother.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: You mean to rescue <em>a child</em>?!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The goblin king took him, and I’ve only got
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … five hours to get him back.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Is this your quest, too, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Save … baby.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your
service, upon my sword.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I happily accept your fealty, Sir
Didymus.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: This is all well an’ good, Missy. But we
still got one little problem.</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … friends.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Yes, yes. We’re friends. Very nice. What’s
that got ta do with us gettin’ over there without a bridge?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Rocks … friends.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: We’re wastin’ our time, Missy. Let’s you an’
me go find another …</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Rocks … friends!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s …</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Ambrosius! My noble steed.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: What will you do after we save the child,
my lady?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can
figure out how.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many
knights to defend your honor?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Not even one.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: It cannot be! What bitter place is this
that does such dishonor to my lady?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s a place where … where nobody really sees
me.</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … see … Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know you do, Ludo. And thanks to you, Sir
Didymus, I finally have a knight.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t you feel like resting?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I ain’t tired.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Me neither. What I am is hungry.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They’re both wonderful, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: They’re alright.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They’re more than that! They’re loyal and
strong … and with their help I’m going to beat Jareth!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And yours, too, of course.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I ain’t no fighter …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Missy … if you’re hungry …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, great!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Even the stars are dancing!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to
amuse you.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Soon, little one. Very, very soon …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Damn you, Jareth! And damn me too!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: You look like a queen.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I … I feel like … I … don’t know what I feel
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are we … are we in a bubble?</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Yes, we are. A dream bubble … where your
dreams can come true.</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: ’Ere it is, Dearie. All the fings you
want, all the fings you need.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What a dream!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yep, you’ve got quite an imagination, kid,
Just what a great actress needs.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance …</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s pov - the market/junkyard teeming with
activity.</strong>: The JUNK WOMAN peers in.</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: ‘Aven’t you got everythin’ you need,
Dearie?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It <em>is</em> just a dream!</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: Best to stay in there, where it’s safe,
Dearie. Don’t know what might ’appen to you out ’ere.</p>
<p><strong>old sarah</strong>: Best to stay in here where it’s safe.
Don’t know what might happen to you out there.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Help! Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Another!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Did you see a noble maiden pass this
way?</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be
doin’ in a place like this?</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: She’s on a rescue mission …</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: A rescue mission, ha! You’re in the
wrong place, for sure! The only fings we cares about rescuin’ around
’ere is our worldly goods!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Didymus, in here! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: Don’t worry, Dearie. I sent ’im
away!</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: Knew you wouldn’t want to be leavin’
your nice fings for no rescue mission.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh my god! Freddie!</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over
there … or that nice teddy?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No! He’s my brother! And I’ve got to save
him!</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: No you don’t, Dearie. You can stay right
’ere with all your pretty fings …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know I can. But I don’t want to!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Now get out of my way!</p>
<p><strong>junk woman</strong>: Wait, Dearie! Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: My lady!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Sarah … safe!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Is Hoggle not with you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hoggle made his choice, he’s … not part of
the mission anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Hoggle … good!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Maybe. But there’s no time to discuss it.
We’ve got a baby to rescue, remember!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: Methinks they are expecting us, my
lady.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Another?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Plastic!</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Drinkin’ to forget, eh, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: To forget, ah yes. To suffer a mental
lapse, to obliterate from one’s consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a
blank or fugue, to drink the waters of Lethe …</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: The waters of forgetfulness. They remove
from our minds what is too painful to remember …</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: … but with the memory goes our wisdom, or
knowledge, that which brings us understanding, also enlightenment …</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: You can cool it down there … he’s gone …</p>
<p><strong>wise one</strong>: … a grasp of things, a depth or profundity
of thought …</p>
<p><strong>hat</strong>: Another one over here … and make it a double
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re going to make it!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: I am less than sure …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I think we lost them.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: What do you see, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … see … trouble!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: ” … it’s so cold in the night with no gold
to keep me warm … ”</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Who goes there?</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: Don’t worry about him. He’s on Jareth’s
payroll now.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: Thash right. Jareth owes me sumthin’ … an’
I’m here ta collect …</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Nice … thing …</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: I fear that this means trouble.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Run for it!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Only a half hour left! We’ve got to find
Freddie!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hoggle!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s the only way he could have gone!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. I have to face him alone!</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: But, my lady …</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I don’t expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives?</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned
peach …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … and I see you lost all your treasures in
the process.</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: I don’t care if I never sees another
treasure again!</p>
<p><strong>hoggle</strong>: And Jareth said ya could never love me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jareth doesn’t know everything.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Take care of him, Didymus.</p>
<p><strong>didymus</strong>: I’ll guard the valiant Hoggle with my
life!</p>
<p><strong>ludo</strong>: Ludo … too!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No maiden could have wished for nobler
knights.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: I’ve been expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s Freddie?!!!</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: He’s right there.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Like the man said, “nothing is what it
appears to be!”</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: There’s still time.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Besides, I’m no longer interested in having
a little goblin prince. I’ve decided I’d much rather have a queen.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: You’ve come a long way, little girl.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I certainly have.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. No one else
has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has ever been
worthy …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What’s your offer.</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Why, everything … you’ll rule by my
side.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Everything? The chance to spend my life
surrounded by repulsive goblins … the chance to torment innocent
creatures …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And what if I’m not interested?</p>
<p><strong>jareth</strong>: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want
…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, I’ve got news for you, Jareth.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t want <em>you</em>!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How could you do this to an innocent
