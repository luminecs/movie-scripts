<p><strong>credit sequence</strong>: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR
nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the
window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates:
each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Labor Day weekend. Some time for a
sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at
the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You
gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity – it keeps you sharp.
A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it’s time to
quit. I started writing after that. Not every night – now and then. Just
to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start
another.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Darling.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Ann.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Have we made New York safe for another
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Robert.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Get a job.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Sad what ten years without sex can do.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Any hundreds?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Twenties – and tens.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Tens!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Goddamn cash machines.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Did what’s-his-name give you a hard
time?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You mean –?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Cash Before Delivery.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Fucking investment bankers.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all
day, they think cash is a theoretical concept – like it doesn’t apply. I
see ’em at two, shudder to think at nine they’re buying and selling –
turned me off the stock market.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s late. You staying?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m gonna crash – try, at least.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we can all eat
together. Go on. You look tired. Here, take a couple of C’s. I’ll pick
up anything that comes in.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sleep tight.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Pick up the trash.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah – big kiss.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: “Labor Day.” “Union Movement” – there’s a
contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It’s worse when I’m off
– I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There’s an element of
providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You’re walking down
the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up
four hours ago, there’s an APB description out and a cop pulls you in
cause he’s cold and wants to go inside – they grab your stash. Your
number’s up. You’re busted for nothing. For bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: Are they “faced”?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Don’t bore me.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: Is it so much work to face them the same
direction? You don’t do it, I got to. It’s time – my time –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Jees –</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: We’ve been through all this. This
nineteen-gram shit is a drag.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We pay you more, you put up with more. White
drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: I can’t believe Ann’s been working as long
as she has – never busted. She’s something.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Never made any big money either.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She blows it.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: You believe that? What you gonna do after
she quits? How long you been with her?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She always says that. We’ll see,
Jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: She’s out. You should pick up her trade.
You’re too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No way. I’m not the management type. I get
in charge, I’ll start using again – not for me. I know music people. I’m
gonna get in recording.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: Tour.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: Normally this wouldn’t matter to you, but
you may get hassled.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jealous</strong>: You read the papers? The Park murder. All
over the Post. Mariah Rangel – nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch
dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they’re
hot after mid-level dealers. They’re buzzin’. You know her?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I look like an encyclopedia? Who knows?
Thanks for the warning.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You pick up from Jealous?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last
night. We’re certainly not his favorite people.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: We don’t make the laws. Nineteen is
carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him be stupid.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: He took my hundreds.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Take over for a while. I’m getting contact
high.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Who’s Her Majesty talking to?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. She’s
trying to get them to come here – or, better, Europe.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: That’s where the money is.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: All mark-up – the “Big One.”</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Don’t dress. You really think she means
it?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That’s what she says. New Year’s Eve and out
– no Acid House, no product, no deliveries.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: That’s just her mouth talking.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Next year – strictly Akasha.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: “Akasha”?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Cosmetics. That’s what Ann’s calling the
company now –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: – this week. I don’t get it – marigolds,
violets, sage – why’d anyone pay to put weeds on their face?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Why’d anyone pay to put them up their nose?
I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with us.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You forget: she hasn’t asked me.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Johnny! Robert! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred Ex
at thirty each and the delivery’s here.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Whatja think?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile,
egg, aloe – the “Almilk” formula. I remixed it.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at
Enhancements and pick up some almond oil – not the California. What
should we order?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: How about Indian?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Darling, it’s Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Thai. We haven’t had Thai in a while.</p>
<p><strong>ann’s voice</strong>: “Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a
message, we’ll get back to you – sooner than you think.”</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Answer that. He’ll call back every five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The night begins.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: “Ped Srilom”? – it’s Northeastern. Duck.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m going veggie. Get me the “Puk Ob.”</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Use it for facial cream.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Remove unsightly hair!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Laugh, one day you’ll be watching me on “Oprah”
from a welfare hotel.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top Lady.
God knows what happened to his shit yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You take it – call in.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It was supposed to be light tonight.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Don’t you watch TV?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you
should be so lucky to be and had one, you’d know it’s supposed to rain
–</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Good for the trees –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Some farmer whacked his numerology on
us.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s started.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The Farmer’s Almanac is based on
numerology.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Raining?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Take a coat. And you, clean up the product
before the food delivery comes.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Le Tour! – finally. What took so long?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Traffic. It’s raining.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How’s things?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I need a quarter – you got it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Robert said he sold you a quarter
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Some friends came over. How much is that?
Fourteen-hundred?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. I’ve
known you, what, like eight years?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Knew you from the other job, the one before
the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife – remember her? We used to
sit and talk and talk –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You don’t know what she was like –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: This is no good. I’ll sell you a gram and
some downs, but I ain’t gonna put you in the emergency room. Cool it. Go
to bed. Sleep it off.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You charge $200 for what goes for ninety on
the street – and you’re not gonna sell?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: So go to the street.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll call Ann.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Go ahead. You know what she’ll say. Phone’s
over there.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll tell the fucking cops.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Fuck you. That’s it. You’re out. Don’t call
again. Catch you next lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Please, Tour, I’m sorry. You’re right. I
didn’t mean that. I’m quitting anyway. I’ll take the gram. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Two hundred?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You got downs? One more thing. I gotta use
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>mid-twentiesh man</strong>: …but – if there’s no God, how can
man conceive of him? The idea of God presupposes the existence of God.
That’s the Ontological Argument. Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen
hundred – I’m not sure –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>mid-twentiesh man</strong>: Let me finish. Okay, if the idea
of God is implanted by God – the sensus divinitatus, the sense of the
divine – what is the role of human thought? Not faith, thought…</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Everybody wants to talk. It’s like a
compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don’t say it. They
figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone
else. He understands. Of course they’re stoned to start. If I could tie
together all the hours of coke talk I’ve heard, that would be a lot of
string. It was Robert’s idea to add twenty-five dollars to home
deliveries cause it’s such a hassle. Fifty is more like it.</p>
<p><strong>first student</strong>: C’mon, Tour, stick around.</p>
<p><strong>second student</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>first student</strong>: There’s only four of us and like
seven of them – and we’re paying for the dope. See her, over there, the
blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? – she’s gonna model for Elite.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Me? I’m an old man. She’d break me like an
old horse.</p>
<p><strong>second student</strong>: Shit, dude –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Nah. Thanks anyway. I gotta go. Have
fun.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Carlos. Wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I’ll give you a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: John. John LeTour.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Get in. You’re getting soaked.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I didn’t know you still lived here.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea. I
should get out.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Don’t be crazy. It’s pouring.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I’m not supposed to be around –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: – former drug associates.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It’s four years I’m clean. No alcohol, no
cigarettes, no nothing.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I heard. I’m happy for you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It’s still not easy.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I know. Mar, you don’t need to avoid me. I’m
straight – two years. It came that time. I tried to tell you. I wrote. I
called.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I should get out.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Honest.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But you’re dealing.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No. I stopped.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What’s in the bag?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Almond oil. You can check. Look.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What’s that for? In case someone needs
almond oil in the middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I still deal a little, but I’m straight –
that part’s true. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Stop here. Now. Stop!</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I won’t say anything. I promise. I’ll just
sit here. I’ll just give you a ride.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Goodbye, John.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Where do you live? Mari…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Eighty-third Street.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Black?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m not sure how this works.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Have you ever been to a psychic before?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No, but I’ve, well, I’ve heard about it.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Do you need advice? John?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No… it’s not that… I don’t know – I just
decided to come. I thought…</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Be comfortable. How did you hear about
me?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: A recommendation. Somebody from work. Two
hundred dollars, right?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: It’s a lot of money?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: I look at you. I give you my impressions. I
feel your “vibrations” – I don’t like that word, it sounds phony, but I
can’t think of anything better. You’re anxious. More than usual. Your
aura is very strong. I feel a very strong vibration from you. A change
is coming. You’re worried about money. You say you don’t care about
money but that’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Your livelihood is endangered. You’re
worried about the future. You don’t have much money saved. What will you
do?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: I see a woman who has betrayed you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: My mother?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Who will betray you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Not… I…</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Keep it in mind. I have a strong feeling
about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you. You’re in
the entertainment business, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: But you’re not happy. You want to do
something else. Is it music?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: You have a talent for music.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: As a child.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: You still have it. It’s strong. I see music
in your future. A career opportunity will come in the music field. Take
it. It won’t seem promising. Take it anyway. You’re full of stress. Are
you exercising?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No. I –</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: You should exercise more. You must let go of
this stress. It’s not good for your health. I’m not saying you’re going
over to the other side, but it’s not good for you. You’re still
drinking, aren’t you? You have a drinking problem? It’s interfering with
your health and your life too. You’ve had other problems. Drug
addiction.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: This was very important in your life.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: You are in the balance. Everything you do –
positive or negative – in this life is a drop that will carry over in
the next. Every act, every decision matters.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Teresa?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m thirty-eight years old. Forty.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: You’re young.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I have trouble sleeping. Look. What do you
see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is
there luck?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: I see a glow. Everything you need is around
you. The only danger is inside you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Your pay’s on the table.</p>
<p><strong>young hasid</strong>: One hundred thirty-one, let’s make it
130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to
you – add tens or whatever if you want.</p>
<p><strong>young hasid</strong>: Same time?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Two weeks – don’t run. Stay a while. We’ll
order kosher. We’ll tell you dirty stories. We’ll talk Zionism.</p>
<p><strong>young hasid</strong>: I’m late already. I only come ’cause I
like you. Sure you’re not Jewish? I don’t want to see you hurt. Find a
man. You should do something else.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Invest in my cosmetics line.</p>
<p><strong>young hasid</strong>: Don’t mix business with friendship.</p>
<p><strong>young hasid</strong>: Shalom.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Shalom. See you next week. Don’t eat any hot
dogs!</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Jealous said something about a yuppie murder
in the Park. You know anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s all over the news.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Jealous said to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: We are careful.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: We’re too small time. Besides, she wasn’t
one of ours – not directly. Tis is at St. Luke’s. He wants somebody over
right away. Second floor waiting room.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: A hospital? What’s he doing there?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: He says he needs you to come to St. Luke’s.
I’d go but I got the other thing.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: The –?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Go. Keep on his good side. He set up
Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Let’s have lunch. Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: One o’clock. C�te Basque. Is that too
early?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No. Yeah – sure.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I vote Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Mixed sushi. Oshitashi.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: You got some valiums?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: – ’n ’ludes.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Just a valium – a ten.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: You won’t believe it. What a nightmare. I
brought in this chick. She O.D.ed – man, I didn’t even know her. I
didn’t have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I’m
hyper. I gotta come down.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Make it two.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She okay?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: The girl.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking
vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You need a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: He’s here. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Randi?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: I can’t believe it. Marianne’s here too. She
flew in. It’s been so long. You look great.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You too. Randi, what’s wrong? Why are you
here?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Mom. She’s back in. Didn’t Marianne tell
you?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Serious?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: More chemo.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Can I see her?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: She’s sleeping. She sleeps most of the time.
She’d like it, though. She still talks about you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m so sorry. She’s a terrific woman. I was
crazy about her. God.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: It’s John. What a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Yes. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Randi told me about your mom. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She’s sedated?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: She would be so happy to see John.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I don’t think that would be a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You both look so tired.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: One of us has to be here.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: The hospital lets us stay in her room.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Let me buy you some coffee or something –
the cafeteria’s downstairs. It helps to talk.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: You go, Marianne, it’s my turn with mom.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Go. You haven’t eaten. Go on. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Bring me a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: This way. Kiss your mother for me.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I like your mom.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: She liked you. You know this will happen
someday, but when it does… Your mother – that was a shock.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She’s been sick a while?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: A year.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Your father?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Not this time. His new wife – he’ll make
it to the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What have you been doing? Where do you
live?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It’s… I don’t want you to know about my
life.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Anything? You married? Have children? A dog?
House plants?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Details just open the door.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: The door to what? It’s not like we’re
strangers. We were married.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: We were not.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: There was a ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: He wasn’t even a minister. He was an
astrologer.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: He was also a minister. “Universal
Harmony.”</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: He was a Pisces.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You’re a Pisces.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It was not legal.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we’re still
–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I was on the cusp.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We were happy.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: We were miserable. We were either scoring
or coming down – mostly coming down.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: There were good times. Area, out on the
street, laughing, dancing with friends – we were magical.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You took off for three months without
telling me and called once. That’s how magical we were. You were an
encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies – I heard them all. Nobody could
clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed,
turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a
gift from God.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You exaggerate.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: In rehab they call this “euphoric recall.”
You only remember the highs, never the lows.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We were happy.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I was drowning.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It wasn’t me –</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You watched –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You jumped –</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You did nothing – “It wasn’t your
business, you weren’t responsible” – you still think like that. Actions
have consequences; so do –</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: – inactions.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I didn’t – I meant well.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You always meant well.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We were in love?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We were happy?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You bought it for me. It’s inscribed
inside.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Ann’s quitting. I’ve got to find something
else to do.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Ann? I’ll believe it when I see it.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Are you really straight?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Let me see your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Eyes are deceiving. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: If I could do that, I could do anything.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We could do anything. We could start
over.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What was that? I think I heard
something.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I have to get back.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’ll walk you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I can always find another way to make a
living. I never planned this in the first place – not like Ann. She came
up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just
wanted to be around her. She’d sit up listening to coke stories. Now
it’s me and Robert. The whole crowd was the same age. Everybody’s
younger now. She made me.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You have any money saved?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: There’s some. Not much. A thousand or two.
Maybe more – I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What do you do with your money?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I don’t know. It’s not that much in the
first place – as you know.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s tax free –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs – what
about your money?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Kitty Ford once told me, “Ann, the only person
I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother.” All the money I’ve
made, all the money I’ve spent – it never adds up. This last two years
cosmetics’ been taking everything.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I wish I could help.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You still go to meetings?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No, but I’m okay. What are the odds of
meeting someone you haven’t seen in years twice in two days?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the
other person – who is it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Just a contact – you don’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: The plan?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: My future?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Too conceptual?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We had this conversation two years ago.
We’ll have it two years from now.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: This time it’s for real.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m thinking of some music courses. Mixing,
sound editing –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You took that before.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: That was acting.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Modeling.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Why all this concern? Suddenly you care?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I have feelings too – you may have noticed. I
guess I’m worried. I’m tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this
business, it’s one thing to act tough – I’ve seen Zipporah twice this
week.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She helps you?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: – harmonizes, she’s encouraging me to get out
of this into the cosmetics thing –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Nomination for Best Picture. I knew every girl
he fucked – how, why. I knew when he had trouble shitting. Like this.
His wife says he gets straight or she cuts him off. Old money. I
remember the last thing he said to me: “See you soon.” Yeah, sure. That
was five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You’ll still talk to me, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You –? Of course I will.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’ll be strange without you around. I hadn’t
thought of it – it hit me.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We’ll always have Paris.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Ann, you want me, call, write a letter, tell
a wino – I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m sorry. I…</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I always thought my father would die first.
He would die, then my mother and I would reconcile. Just her and me. I
hated him for living.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It’s like a joke. It’s not a real feeling.
It’s like a feeling of a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: My old man bawling in the hospital, me
popping in and out of the john getting loaded. I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You tried to kill me. You took ten years
of my life one way or another. I couldn’t hate my mom – I was too busy
hating you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I thought I was just killing myself.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Selfish.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What it felt like. What this tasted
like.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I see you and my heart starts thumping.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Excuse us. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Come. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Have you ever had sex totally straight?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Not with you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Neither have I.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Such an erection.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Never had anything like it stoned. Feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Weird.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I’m dripping.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Let’s disappear.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Kiss, kiss, kiss.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Kiss, kiss, kiss.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Together.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You need to go back?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: This is the end. It was wonderful. I’m
glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see
me, you will not call me again. I’m happy for you. I wish you the best.
I’m leaving. I’m going back to the hospital. I shouldn’t have left – but
I don’t regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a
key. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Marianne…</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke,
gettin’ some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: There was a mix-up –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.’s
got some conference in two days. The holiday’s over – ragheads
everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel – little creeps
with lapel pins. Even I’ve been out. This is where our money is: Europe,
Asia, not the streets – you wouldn’t know crack from crackerjacks.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Where’s Robert?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Busting his ass. He’s out doing your job.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It was a confusion.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Get confused on your day off.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: When is that?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Don’t get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck
your dick? – okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There’s a list on the
TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m on my way. Love you. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri,
Tasha – you know Thomas. They’re here for a show.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Enchant�. How’d it turn out?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Questo � un vero Americano. What?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: St. Luke’s.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: No problem, but – can you believe this? – she’s
out of the hospital in one day, calls me up, wants to “get together.”
Some people are just born for losing. Want to go in back?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late
twenties, brown suit, drinking tonic? He’s casing you. Not me, you.
Undercover, whatever – he’s on you.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Just a feeling. You holding?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: No. Need help?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Leave a message. Robert or I will come by
later.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Forget it. It wasn’t for me anyway. Who am I
trying to impress? Make it tomorrow. A half – no, three- quarters.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Nineteen is the top. I’ll make two
trips.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Nineteen is fine.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: A domani. Take care, girls.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I feel my life turning. All it needed was a
direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Suddenly there is a
direction. What a strange thing to happen halfway through your life.</p>
<p><strong>hotel switchboard</strong>: Paramount Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Marianne Jost, please.</p>
<p><strong>hotel switchboard</strong>: Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>hotel message</strong>: “Welcome to the Paramount. Your party
is out. If you would like to leave a message for –</p>
<p><strong>‘marianne jost’</strong>: – please do so after the beep.”</p>
<p><strong>hotel switchboard</strong>: Paramount Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Marianne Jost.</p>
<p><strong>hotel switchboard</strong>: Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>hotel switchboard</strong>: I’m sorry. Ms. Jost checked out
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She was there yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>hotel switchboard</strong>: She checked out this morning.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Did she leave a forwarding number?</p>
<p><strong>hotel switchboard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>st. luke’s switchboard</strong>: St. Luke’s – Roosevelt
Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She’s a patient.</p>
<p><strong>st. luke’s switchboard</strong>: Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>medical voice</strong>: Who is this calling?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Skyline Floral. We’re trying to confirm a
delivery.</p>
<p><strong>medical voice</strong>: Mrs. Jost passed away last night.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Are the funeral arrangements local?</p>
<p><strong>medical voice</strong>: Just a sec – yes, Plaza Memorial.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>medical voice</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Can I help you, officer?</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I hope I haven’t made a mistake. You are a
cop, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Could I see a badge?</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Bill Guidone.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: You think you’re invisible, don’t you? You
think we don’t know you, LeTour – that’s the name you use, right?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: My father’s a partner in a powerful law
firm. If you have anything in mind, do it by the book.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: You? Who the fuck cares about you? I could
grind you right here! – maybe I will! – and nobody would give a fuck!
You’re not worth the paperwork. I look like Narcotics? I’m Homicide –
I’m investigating the Park murder.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I don’t follow the news.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Downtown’s interested how a Barnard honors
student with fancy parents got a quarter of uncut coke on her when she
was murdered. I mean, we just don’t see this girl cruising Alphabet City
trying to score. Somebody sold her, somebody upscale and classy – you’re
classy, I hear – and that somebody knows something we need to know.
Delivery boy!</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I wish I could help. I don’t even know who’s
president.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Let me put it this way. Here’s my card Ask
around, take a week or so. Call me. Tell me something I don’t know.
Either that, leave town, or get your ass busted day in, day out.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Marianne…</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Every time you come into my life something
terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How’d you get here? I
don’t want you here! I don’t want you around me, I don’t want you around
my mother! Damn you!</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Marianne…</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: I’m sorry. That’s the way it is. You
shouldn’t have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying.
She wasn’t there when Mother passed – died – she blames herself. It
wouldn’t have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne’s –
I’m worried –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s…</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Don’t try.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yes, you. I can’t think of anything, but if
there was anything I could do…</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Thanks. I’m okay – I guess. I mean, we’ve
been expecting it. It’ll hit me later.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I saw her.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Your mother. I came in the room. You were
sleeping. I just watched.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Oh. I’d better get back. Marianne’s probably
flipping out.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Have some shu mai. Just delivered.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I told Ann you’d be on time. Tis called. He
said before ten. He said you were right.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: An undercover cop. Not a narc. The Park
murder. Jealous was straight on that – you hear anything?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Remember the time that cop called here?
Wanted to know if we had “nose candy”? Ann says, “John Candy?” “John
Candy?”</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s wrong baby? You like like shit.
Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You can’t fool me. I can read you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What do you care? You’re leaving me. A few
more months – sayonara. You too. John who? What was his name again? Le
–? I mean it’s not exactly like I got a pension plan.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Johnny, it’s not that at all. Is that what you
think? You hate cosmetics. You don’t care about it. You told me
that.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Who knows what will happen?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I got a friend – a D.D. – got into lapidary.
I’ll introduce you. You have to pass a test.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Lapi –?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Any more about the Park murder?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s with this thing?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Stay away.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You want in? We’ll make a place for you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: “Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come. The other
thing is over. I’ll be home all night. 749-2876.”</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Don’t answer it. Let him call all night. He’s
trouble. I don’t want to deal with him.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s alright, I’ll go. Let me handle it.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m sorry if –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: He gives you shit – fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: We’re going Chinese tonight, okay? I mean
we’re on a roll –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Spring roll.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Sure, whatever. Surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You gotta get permission? Check with
Mama?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m calling your brother.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I’m gonna
ask him to come over. You’ve told me so much about him.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, don’t. Please, I’ll give you money,
anything. He doesn’t understand. Whose side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Is this Martin Jeer? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I shoulda never called.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I recommend Hazelden. It has the best
all-around program. Martin Jeer? I’m here with your brother Ed. Yeah, in
the city. I’m afraid there’s a medical emergency. You’re going to have
to come.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: He’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen,
right?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Thirty-eight hundred – got any hundreds?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Some, not the whole thing. You got
hundreds?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: I like that about Ann. Always takes the time to
grind it. If you do it, do it right.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Looks like you could use some help. Mari, this
is Tour. You got any hundreds?</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Not the talkative type. Haven’t seen her in
years. You know her, don’t you? Why they call me? What a nightmare. You
want it or not?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>male cop</strong>: Who saw it? What happened? EMS is on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Too late –</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Where to, sir? Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Nowhere just now. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You want me to wait here?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Downtown.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: This story is just in. A woman has
fallen thirty stories to her death from a posh Grace Towers apartment on
Lexington Avenue. Police are withholding identification pending the
notification of the next of kin. The incident happened about ten p.m.
According to the sources on the scene there was no one else in the posh
Grace Towers apartment when the fall occurred. We will bring you more
details as we get them. An end to the sanitation strike seems imminent.
Negotiations at the Helmsley Palace are continuing to this hour…</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: John. John LeTour. Can I see you?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s important, Teresa.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Call. Make an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Open the door. You’re awake anyway.
Teresa.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Read me. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We had a session last week. What do you
see?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yes. Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Step back. Again. Death.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Someone I knew died tonight.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: This was not an accident. This person was
murdered.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Am I in danger?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: There is danger around you. It’s very close.
I’m sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: I can’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Please. Am I lucky?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Yes. Don’t be afraid. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.</p>
<p><strong>police switchboard</strong>: Ninth Precinct.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Bill Guidone, please. Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>police switchboard</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Guidone.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: This is John LeTour. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Laundromat. Your father’s got
connections.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You said I should ask around, tell you
something you didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: I thought you’d call.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It ain’t much, but it’s something.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: A girl died last night. Lexington Ave.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: The jumper. Druggie.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: The news said she was alone in the apartment
when she went out – she wasn’t. It’s a cover-up. There was someone
else.</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Who lives in the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>guidone</strong>: You there?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: That’s all I know. You asked me to tell you
something. I told you something.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Jack. Let me in.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Where have you been? We were worried.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I need some sleep – not much. I don’t want
to go home just yet. A little sleep first. Can I crash here? Nice
place.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s hideous. I did it years ago. I’ve got
to throw everything out. You haven’t been here? Oh, Jack, this is Tony.
I told you about him. You should talk. He’s the lapidopterist –
gems.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Lapidarian.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Same thing.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Can I?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What do you know about Tis? What’s his
relationship to Ann?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: They go way back – before me. Did you cross
him?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Don’t. He’s Ann’s Ecstasy connection. She
needs that score. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Don’t mess with him.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Is he dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Everybody’s dangerous. We heard what you did
to Eddie. Ann thought it was great. She was afraid that was why you
didn’t come back.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It was something else. Tell me if you hear
anything.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Tis.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Tis who? Ann says you want a chart done.
What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Ah…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You down?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Yeah… You ever think about it?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: That it’d be like this – like, your life,
you… that it would turn out this way? –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Compared to what? My thinking this or that
is going to make any difference? There’s a plan unfolding. “Will my
plane crash?” “Does life have meaning?” – why ask me? Thinking’s a fear
of living, negative living; living’s something else. You’re afraid. Let
the plan unfold. Stop. Stop, live one day – one day –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: – Robert –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: – day at a time.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You’ve lost your fucking brain.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m a drug dealer.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Got a tub?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: There’s a plastic bottle of bath oil in the
cabinet. Yellow. Use it – tell me what you think. It’s a new
formula.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Manny. LeTour. Jealous. “Jell.” SOB’s.</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Reggae night.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Burning Spear.</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: How’d you get in?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: You buying?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: How’s product?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I got a problem. I need a piece.</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: A gun.</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Now. Anything. Am I speaking too fast?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: How much you spend?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: The rate. What you got?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: He’s got a 64 Smith-son. Detective Special.
Nobody wants ’em. Fresh from a cop.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Four – including me.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You’re fucking me.</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Street price.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Sigame.</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: The hundreds – Franklins.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: How do you use this?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Automatic.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I don’t have much use for a gun. Never used
one like this.</p>
<p>****: Cono!</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Simple. You put the bullets in – you point
it at the bad guys, pull the trigger and they fall down!</p>
<p><strong>manuel</strong>: Vaya con Dios.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: – Dios.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Have you been to the police station?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: She was back on drugs. Really back. They’re
gonna bring her here too. My God. I thought she was playing for
attention.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: You’re not to blame. Don’t blame yourself.
You weren’t responsible. She was always – she loved you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: She loved you. You were what she wanted to
be.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: She scared me.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Look. Do you recognize anyone?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Tis.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: His father’s a lawyer. Did some tax things
for Mom. He was at the hospital. What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s me. Cologne. I’m a sucker for that
cheap airplane stuff. Did Marianne mention him yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: It was his apartment. What are you
thinking?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: She jumped. You loved her, but she – this
sounds terrible but it’s true – she was… she ruined everything… bad
luck.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: When’s the funeral – your mother’s?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Tomorrow. Will you come?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Well, I got this thing to do. It’s – I don’t
know if I can get away.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Try? For me.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: The Prodigal Son.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Sorry about last night. Something came
up.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: “Too Complicated To Explain.”</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I’m $500 short from last night. I’ll get it,
you can take it from my salary.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: This is family. Are you saying that to hurt me?
It’s not money.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Look at this. We had a graphic artist make
it up – you know, Billy, Five Towns.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: The label for the cosmetics line.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Classy. Sorta – Katmandu…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Kathmandu.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Tis called twice. He wants you to come
by.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again
yesterday, but didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: A lie. I don’t want to go. The suicide and
all. Let’s stay away.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Can’t. He’s the Ecstasy connect. No way I can
fuck this.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: This is business.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Let Robert go.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Tis won’t deal with fags.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Just is – so he’s a bigot? What’s new? So’s
everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I don’t want to go. I got a bad vibe.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: He said you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Why don’t you go? He’s your contact.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: He is –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You giving orders?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, Missy.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Come with me – the two of us.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Okay. You got it. Like old times – Ann and
Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Stop it. You’re breaking my heart.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s going to be strange, not doing this. I
mean I’ve had it, but sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You’re gonna do it, aren’t you? You’re gonna
quit.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I think so. Seal this thing with Tis, turn it –
go with the cosmetics. You gotta take a chance in life. No risk, no
gain. I’ve already got retail connections here, London. It was great at
the beginning, though.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You know, when we first started out of the
place on Greene Street. Before deliveries, when you were still using. It
was open house every night but Sunday. We had everything: uppers,
downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? You
could get in for a gram, stay all night – everybody, music people,
movies, Wall Street, fashion – even politics. I think like five
marriages came out of those parties, babies – really. God. You stayed,
you then Robert – but he… I’da never thought you’d, what is it, twelve
years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using,
unreliable – nice kids. Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty
fingers –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You made me –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: – never washed –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: – khaki pants.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I should write a book someday. Did you know
somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course
– my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think
my life is so glamorous, but they don’t know. I know. Glamorous. It was
for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I gotta stop home a second.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Why? It’s out of the way. They’re expecting
you.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Chill. This is routine.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I want to get my lucky jacket.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That took long enough. What did you do, douche
while you were at it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Ann, you got some mouth on you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You don’t want to know where it’s been.
Cologne?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you
on airplanes. It’s no good for your skin. All chemicals.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Don’t ask why, just promise.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: If anything happens to me – if I should
like, you know, fucking die – write and tell her.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s my sister. Her husband’s in San
Quentin. She worries, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I thought we were going to Tis’?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: We are. He’s here. He can’t very well work out
of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mathis Bruge, please. Tis? Ann. I’m here with
Tour. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Tis there?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Twelve-oh-four.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Ann.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I told you greasy fucks I don’t deal with guns!
I see guns, I walk! How dare you?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss
my fat ass!</p>
<p>****: That’s it! TIS! Shitball! I know you’re fucking there! Let this
be a lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this! Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hold it! Stop right there.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: No! Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was
just trying to make a point – I apologize.</p>
<p>****: Assholes. What a nightmare. We’ll make the deal tomorrow – same
terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, you’re upset. I just need to talk to
Tour a second. About a police matter. Right?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Tour and I need to get our stories straight.
Somebody’s talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a
point, dumb –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: We came together, we’re leaving together.
Johnny, come with me.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: Don’t be stupid. Get out. Leave. I had nothing
to do with Marianne – she jumped: she was there, then she was gone.
Nothing will happen to Tour.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Fire! Fire! Fire!</p>
<p><strong>tis</strong>: I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: she sits quietly. A CORRECTIONS OFFICER
instructs the visitors to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Twenty minutes. You look terrific.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I look respectable. Any news?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Sentencing’s in ten days – supposed to be.
Because of the extenuating circumstances – our cooperation – they say it
won’t be more than five years – maybe seven. With time served, good
behavior, parole, I could be out in two years – maybe. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It feels like forever.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: It’s not so bad. It’s a relief in a way – at
least so far. I’ve been writing, reading.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I love your letters.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think
he thought it would be less work, more money. It’s lucky in a way I got
mixed up in it – now I have to see this thing through. So it’s cosmetics
after all.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Did we ever fuck?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: You know, make love.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: There was that party when everybody was so
stoned, but – oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept
together.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: We were naked, but did we –?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You had a hard-on…</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You tried…</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: I was thinking about it and I realized we
never really did. It’s one of the things I think about. It’s one of the
things I look forward to. I’ve been looking forward.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>letour</strong>: Something can be right in front of you and
you can’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Strange how things work.</p>
