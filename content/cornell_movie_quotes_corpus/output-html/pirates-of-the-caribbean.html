<p><strong>young elizabeth</strong>: Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate’s life for
me Yo, ho, yo, ho, it’s a pirate’s life for me…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: …drink up me hearties, yo, ho…</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these
waters. You want to call ’em down on us?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Mr. Gibbs.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: That will do.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to
sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog– mark my
words.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Consider them marked. On your way.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: ’Aye, Captain. Bad luck to have a woman on
board, too. Even a mini’ture one.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I think it would be rather exciting to
meet a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Think again, Miss Swan. Vile and
dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirates brand, gets what he
deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Captain Norrington… I appreciate your fervor,
but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: My apologies, Governor.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Actually, I find it all fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, father.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I still think it would be exciting to
meet a pirate…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Look! A boy! In the water!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Man overboard!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Boy overboard!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Fetch a hook! Haul him out of there!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: He’s still breathing.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Mary mother of God …</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: An explosion in the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Lot of good it did them… Everyone’s thinking
it! I’m just saying it! Pirates!</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: There is no proof of that. It could have been
an accident. Captain, these men were protection. If there is even the
slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot
abandon them!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Of course not, Governor. Come about and
strike the sails! Unlash the boats! Gunnery crew… jackets off the
cannons! Hope for the best…prepare for the worst. Move the boy aft.
We’ll need the deck clear.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Elizabeth, I want you to accompany the boy.
He’s in your charge now. You’ll watch over him?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: My name is Elizabeth Swann.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Will Turner.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’m watching over you, Will.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Did he speak?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: His name is Will Turner – that’s all I
found out.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you
decent?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes – yes.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Still abed at this hour? It’s a beautiful
day!</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: I have a gift for you.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote
upon his daughter with gifts?</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Although…I did think you could wear it to the
ceremony today.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Ceremony?</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Captain Norrington’s promotion ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Or, rather, Commodore Norrington…a fine
gentleman, don’t you think? He fancies you, you know.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Elizabeth? How’s it coming?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Difficult … to say.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: I’m told that dress is the very latest
fashion in London.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Women in London must have learned to not
breath.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Governor? A caller is here for you.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Ah, Mr. Turner! It’s good to see you
again!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good day, sir. I have your order.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The blade is folded steel. That’s gold
filigree laid into the handle. If I may -</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Impressive. .. very impressive. Commodore
Norrington will be pleased, I’m sure. Do pass my compliments on to your
master.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear
his work is appreciated –</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Elizabeth! You look stunning!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Will! It’s so good to see you!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I dreamt about you last night. Will
reacts with surprise: “Really?</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: About the day we met. Do you
remember?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I could never forget it, Miss Swann.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Will, how many times must I ask you to
call me ‘Elizabeth’?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Well said! There’s a boy who understands
propriety. Now, we must be going.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Good day, Mr. Turner.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good day.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>in the carriage</strong>: Swann glowers at his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit more
decorum in front of Commodore Norrington. After all, it is only</p>
<p><strong>harbormaster</strong>: If you’re out rolling scuppers in this
tub, you’re either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s remarkable how often those two traits
coincide.</p>
<p><strong>harbormaster</strong>: It’s a shilling for the dock space,
and you’re going to have to give me your name.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you say to three shillings, and we
forget the name?</p>
<p><strong>harbormaster</strong>: Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: This dock is off-limits to civilians.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry, I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two
weren’t invited?</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: No … someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This must be some important boat.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: Ship.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ship.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Captain Norrington’s made it his flagship.
He’ll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish
Lake.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: Commodore.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Right. Commodore Norrington.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s a fine goal, I’m sure … But it seems to
me a ship like that – – makes this one here just a wee superfluous.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these
waters, true enough – but there’s no ship that can match the Interceptor
for speed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That so? I’ve heard of one, supposed to be
fast, nigh uncatchable … the Black Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: There’s no real ship as can match the
Interceptor.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: The Black Pearl is a real ship.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: No, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Yes it is. I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: You’ve seen it?</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: You’ve seen the Black Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: You’ve seen a ship with black sails that’s
crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself
spat him back out?</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: … No .</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: But I’ve seen a ship with black sails.</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: Oh, and no ship that’s not crewed by the
damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out
could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn’t possibly be any
ship other than the Black Pearl. Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: … no.</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: Like I said, there’s no real ship as can
match – Hey!</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: Get away from there! You don’t have
permission to be aboard there!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just such a pretty boat.
Ship.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Smith.</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: What’s your business in Port Royal,
‘Mr. Smith’ ?</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: And no lies!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: None? Very well. You’ve rumbled me. I confess:
I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga,
and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: I said, no lies.</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: I think he’s telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: He’s not telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: He may be.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: If he were telling the truth he wouldn’t
have told us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn’t
believe the truth if he told it to you.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: May I have a moment?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: You look lovely. Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I apologize if I seem forward – but I
must speak my mind.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: This promotion confirms that I have
accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career. But it also casts
into sharp relief that which I have not achieved. The thing all men most
require: a marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman,
Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Elizabeth! .</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: The rocks, sir! It’s a miracle she missed
them!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Aren’t you going to save her?</p>
<p><strong>mullr0y</strong>: I can’t swim.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sailors.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t lose these.</p>
<p><strong>fort charles</strong>: The British flag flies, blown from an
offshore breeze. Suddenly the wind dies, and the flag goes limp.</p>
<p><strong>on the docks</strong>: Wood and metal fittings on lines bang
against masts. The wind dies, and there is silence.</p>
<p><strong>on the edge of town</strong>: A CARIBE WOMAN feeds clucking
chickens, frowns when they all suddenly go quiet …</p>
<p><strong>in the village</strong>: A weather vane moves slightly in the
wind. The wind stops, and all is still. And then …</p>
<p><strong>on the docks</strong>: The lines bang against the other sides
of the masts, the wind far stronger now.</p>
<p><strong>fort charles</strong>: the British flag flies in the opposite
direction, snapping in the new onshore breeze.</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: the medallion hangs below Elizabeth’s
unmoving form - - and then Jack is there. He wraps an arm around her and
makes for the surface.</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: Jack realizes that it is Elizabeth’s
heavy velvet dress that is weighing them down. He pulls at the buttons
on the back, and they give way. He skins her out of the dress, and kicks
away from it.</p>
<p><strong>on the surface</strong>: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: Not breathing.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: I never would have thought of that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Clearly, you’ve never been to Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: On your feet.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Elizabeth! Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes – yes, I’m fine – Commodore
Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I believe thanks are in order.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Had a brush-up with the East India
Trading Company, did you … pirate?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette,
fetch some irons.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Well, well… Jack Sparrow, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I don’t see your ship – Captain.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: He said he’d come to commandeer one.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: I told you he was telling the truth. These
are his, sir.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Extra powder, but no additional
shot.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: It doesn’t bear true.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I half-expected it to be made of
wood.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Taking stock: you’ve got a pistol with
only one shot, a compass that doesn’t point north … and no ship. You are
without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah, but you have heard of me.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Carefully, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not,
this man saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: One good deed is not enough to redeem a
man of a lifetime of wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But it seems to be enough to condemn him.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Commodore Norrington … my pistol and belt,
please.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Commodore!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Elizabeth – it is Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miss Swann, if you’ll be so kind?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now, if you’ll be very kind?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You are despicable.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I saved your life; now you’ve saved mine.
We’re square.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Gentleman. .. m’ lady. .. you will always
remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: On his heels! Gillette, bring a squad
down from the fort!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, I’m all right, I’m fine! Go capture
him.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Here, dear … you should wear this.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you, Father … and let that be the
last of your fashion advice, please.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Right where I left you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Not where I left you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re the one they’re hunting. The
pirate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You look familiar … Have I ever threatened you
before?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ve made a point of avoiding familiarity with
pirates.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black
mark on your record. So if you’ll excuse me …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing
blades with a pirate?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You threatened Miss Swann.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Only a little.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know what you’re doing, I’ll give you that
… Excellent form … But how’s your footwork? If I step here -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Very good! And if I step again, you step
again. . .</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ta!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s a good trick. Except, once again, you
are between me and the way out. And now you have no weapon.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who makes all these?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I do. And I practice with them. At least three
hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the
reason you practice three hours a day is you’ve found one – but can’t
get her?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. I practice three hours a day so that when
I meet a pirate … I can kill him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You cheated.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Move away.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. I can not just step aside and let you
escape.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re lucky, boy – this shot’s not meant for
you.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Excellent work, Mister Brown. You’ve
aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Just doing my civic duty.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I believe you will always remember this
as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: That ratter broke my bottle.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Nice and toasty. Thank you,
Estrellia.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in
his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Come here, boy… Want a nice, juicy
bone?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can keep doing that forever, that dog’s
never going to move.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Excuse us if we ain’t resigned ourselves
to the gallows just yet.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Has my daughter given you an answer yet?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: No. She hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Well, she had a taxing day… Ghastly weather
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Bleak. Very bleak.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Cannon fire!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know those guns!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s the Black Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: The Black Pearl? I’ve heard stories …
she’s been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years … and
never leaves any survivors.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There are a lot of stories about the Black
Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Governor! Barricade yourself in my
office! That’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: They’ve flanked us! Men! Swords and
pistols!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Up there!</p>
<p><strong>estrella</strong>: Miss Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>estrella</strong>: Are they come to kidnap you, miss? The
daughter of the governor would be very valuable.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Listen, Estrella – they haven’t seen you.
Hide, and first chance, run for the fort .</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: We know you’re here, poppet. Come out and we
promise we won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: We will find you, poppet … You’ve got
something of ours, and it calls to us!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: The gold calls to us!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Hello, poppet.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Please, no …</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Par. .. Parlay!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay!
According to” the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan
and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: I know the code.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If an adversary demands parley, you can
do them no harm until the parlay is complete.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: It would appear, so do you.</p>
<p><strong>smoldering pirate</strong>: To blazes with the code!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: She wants to be taken to the Captain, and
she’ll go without a fuss.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: We must honor the code.</p>
<p><strong>prisioner</strong>: Praise be!</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: My sympathies, friend - - you’ve no manner
of luck at all!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s all right, doggie … come here,</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s the matter, boy?</p>
<p><strong>twigg</strong>: This isn’t the armory.</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: Well, well… Look what we have here, Twigg.
It’s. Captain Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>twigg</strong>: Huh. Last time I saw you, you were all alone
on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. I’d heard you’d
gotten off, but I didn’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: Did you sprout little wings and
flyaway?</p>
<p><strong>twigg</strong>: His fortunes aren’t improved much.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Worry about your own fortunes. The lowest
circle of hell is reserved for betrayers … and mutineers.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You are cursed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The stories are true.</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: You know nothing of hell.</p>
<p><strong>bosun</strong>: I didn’t know we was taking captives.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: She’s invoked the right of parlay… with
Captain Barbossa.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I am here to –</p>
<p><strong>bosun</strong>: You’ll speak when spoken to!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: And you’ll not lay a hand on those under
the protection of parlay!</p>
<p><strong>bosun</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Captain Barbossa … I have come to
negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: There was a lot of long words in there,
miss, and we’re not but humble pirates. What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I want you to leave. And never come
back.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: I am disinclined to acquiesce to your
request. Means’ No. ’</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’ll drop it!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: My holds are bursting with swag. That bit
of shine matters to me … Why?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Because it’s what you’re searching for.
You’ve been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Did you, now?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Fine. I suppose if this is worthless,
there’s no reason to keep it.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You have a name, missy?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Elizabeth - Turner. I’m a maid in the
governor’s household. Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms
what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange
glances and nods.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You’ve got sand, for a maid.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Of course. I didn’t steal it, if that’s
what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: No, no, nothing like that. Very well. You
hand that over, we’ll put your town to our rudder and ne’er return.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Can I trust you?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: It’s you who invoked the parlay! Believe
me, Miss, you’d best hand it over, now… or these be the last friendly
words you’ll hear!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Our bargain. . ?</p>
<p><strong>bosun</strong>: Still the guns, and stow ’em! Signal the men,
set the flags, and make good to clear port!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Wait! You must return me to shore!
According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: First. Your return to shore was not part
of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I ‘must’ do nothing.
Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate’s code to apply. And
you’re not. And thirdly…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Miss Swann! Elizabeth!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They’ve taken her! They’ve taken
Elizabeth!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: We’re aware of the situation.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We have to hunt them down – and save her!</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Where do you propose we start? If you have
any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! If anyone
does, tell me! Leave, Mr. Turner.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: That Jack Sparrow… he talked about the
Black Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: Mentioned it, is more what he did.</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: Still –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We can ask him where it is – maybe he can lead
us to it!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We could strike a bargain -</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: No. The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell. Ergo, he is not their ally, and
therefore of no value. We will determine their most likely course, and
launch a search mission that sails with the tide.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s not good enough. This is Elizabeth’s
life!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Mr. Turner, this is not the time for
rash actions. Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man
here who loves Elizabeth. Now, go home.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you familiar with that ship? The Black
Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Somewhat.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where does it make berth?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Surely you’ve heard the stories? The Black
Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta… an island that cannot be
found – except by those who already know where it is.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The ship’s real enough. So its anchorage must
be a real place. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why ask me?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Because you’re a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And you want to turn pirate yourself?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Never. They took Miss Swann.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So it is that you found a girl. Well, if
you’re intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair
lady’s heart, you’ll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for
me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I can get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How? The key’s run off.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I helped build these cells. Those are
hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door’ll
lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum. . .</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your name is Turner.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes. Will Turner.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will Turner… I’ll tell you what, Mr. Turner.
I’ve changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of
death, I’ll you to the Black Pearl. Do we have an accord?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Agreed!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Someone will have heard that. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not without my effects.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We need to go!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why are you bothering with that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My business, Will. As for your business -one
question, or there’s no use going. This girl – what does she mean to
you? How far are you willing to go to save her?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’d die for her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah, now there’s a lovely sight!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I knew the Harbormaster wouldn’t report her.
Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there’s no predicting
’em. But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come aboard.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I haven’t set foot off dry land I was twelve,
when the ship I was on exploded. It’s been a sound policy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No worries there. She’s far more likely to rot
out from under us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Besides, we are about to better our prospects
considerably.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’re going to steal a ship? That ship?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Commandeer. We’re going to commandeer a ship.
Nautical term.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s still against the law.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This is either crazy, or brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Remarkable how often those two traits
coincide.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everybody stay calm. We’re taking over the
ship!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aye! Avast!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dead serious.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: You understand this ship cannot be crewed
by only two men. You’ll never make it out of the bay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Sir, I’ll not see any of my men killed or
wounded in this foolish enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat,
so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Agreed. You have the momentary advantage,
sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: As likely as not. Will, short up the anchor,
we’ve got ourselves a ship!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A little help?</p>
<p><strong>murtogg</strong>: I can’t believe he’s doing this.</p>
<p><strong>mullroy</strong>: You didn’t believe he was telling the
truth, either.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Do you have any idea, boy, what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Lookee there, mate! We’re underway!</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Commodore –</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: A moment.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing
your ship!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Rash, Turner, too rash.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Search every cabin, every hold, down to
the bilges!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can you swim? Can. You. Swim?</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Of course, sir. Like a fish. I grew up
summers living in Dover, with my uncle -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship
ready to make way! We’d’ve had a hard time of it by ourselves!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Raise the sails.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: The wind is quarter from astern … by the
time we’re underway, we’ll never catch them.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: We need only to come about, to put them
in range of the long nines.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Hands! Come about! Jackets off the
cannons! We are to fire on our own ship?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Better to see it at the bottom of the
sea than in the hands of a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>steersman</strong>: Captain, there’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>steersman</strong>: He’s disabled the rudder chain, sir.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: So it would seem.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: He’s got to be the best pirate I’ve ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: So it would seem.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: You’ll be dining with the Captain, and he
requests you wear this.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Tell the captain that I am disinclined to
acquiesce to his request.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: He said you say that! He also said if that
be the case, you’ll be dining with the crew, and you’ll be naked.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Maid or not, it fits you.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Now, none of that. Please dig in.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: No need to stand on ceremony, and no call
to impress anyone. You must be hungry.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Try the wine.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: And the apples – one of those next.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s poisoned!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Oh, there would be no sense in killing
you, Miss Turner.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Then why aren’t you eating?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Would that I could.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s a pirate medallion.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: It’s a piece of the treasure of Isla de
Muerta .</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Ah, so you don’t know as much as you
pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a great bloody swath through the
New World, a high priest gave. him all the gold they had, with one
condition: that he spare the people’s lives. Of course, Cortes being
Cortes, he didn’t. He’d’ve made a great pirate, that one.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: So the priest, with his dying breath,
called on the power of the blood of his people, and put on the gold a
curse. If anyone took so much as a single piece, as he was compelled by
greed, by greed he would be consumed.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Within a day of leaving port for Spain,
the treasure ship carrying the gold … something went wrong. The ship run
aground, every man aboard dead, save one. He survived long enough to
hide the gold ashore.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That’s all very interesting, but I hardly
believe in ghost stories any more.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You idiot girl! It’s no make- believe! My
crew and I, we found the gold, and we did more than take one piece, we
took it all. Rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it
away in exchange</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: There is but one way to remove the curse.
All of the scattered pieces of the treasure must be restored in full,
and the blood repaid.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Apple?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: I’m curious – after killing me, what is it
you were planning to do next?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Look! LOOK! The moonlight shows us for
what we really are! We are not among the living and so we cannot die
-</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: – but neither are we dead! We have all the
desires of the living, but cannot satisfy them! Ten years I have been
parched of thirst, and unable to quench it! Ten years, I have been
starving to death – and haven’t died!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: And I have not felt anything for ten years
… Not the wind on my face, nor the spray of the sea … … nor the flesh of
a woman …</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You’d best start believing in ghost
stories, Miss Turner. Because now you’re in one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For a man whose made an industry of avoiding
boats, you’re a quick study.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.
After my mother passed, I came out here … looking for my father.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My father. William Turner?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m not a simpleton. At the jail - - it was
only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. Since that’s
what I wanted, I didn’t press the matter. But now -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew
him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or
‘Bootstrap’ Bill.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: ‘Bootstrap?’</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good man. Good pirate. And clever -“- I never
met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were
puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I swear, you look just like him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s not true that my father was a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Figured you wouldn’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable
man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You think your father is the only man who ever
lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do
another? There’s quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag
to ease the burdens of respectable</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My father did not think of my mother -his
family – as a burden.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure – because he could always go
pirating.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My father – was not – a pirate!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Put it away, Will. It’s not worth getting beat
again.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You didn’t beat me. You ignored the rules of
engagement. In a fair fight, I’d kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then that’s not much incentive for me to fight
fair, is it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: As long as you’re just hanging there, pay
attention. Must, Should, do, don’t, shall, shall not – those are just
suggestions. There are only two absolute rules.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What a man can do. And what a man can I t
do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For instance: you can accept that your father
was a pirate and still a good man… or you can’t. Now me, I can sail this
ship to Tortuga, by myself. . . But I can’t just let you drown.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Tortuga?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh – did I forget to mention that?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just do it quickly.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ve already got my Quartermaster
– there!</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: You stole my boat.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put
together -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Borrowed. Borrowed your boat. Without
permission.</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: That boat is my livelihood!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ll get it back. Or one better.</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Jack! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He knows Gibbs.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed
idiot Mother’s love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he’s
sleeping. It’s bad luck!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.
The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and
the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a
proposition.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye, that’ll about do it.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Blast it, I’m already awake!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I know. That was for the smell.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just the one.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Make it_ast, then. Now, what’s the nature of
this venture of yours?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Oh, there’s a hard tale, Jack. Most of the
decent pirates in town won’t sail with you – seem to think you’re a
jinx.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten
that idea?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m going after the Black Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Say again?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I know where
its going to be, and I’m going to take it.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Jack, it’s a fool’s errand: You’ve heard the
tales they tell about the Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Aye, and that’s why I know where it’s going to
be, and that’s why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a
crew.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: A fool’s errand.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: And you’ve got that, have you?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and
shifts his eyes’ – behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailor
away from the table.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Back there, guarding the door is the son of
old Bootstrap Bill Turner.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Well, lookee there. I’ll allow you may be
onto something, Jack. There’s bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as
you. I’ll find some men.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Kid’s a bit of a stick, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That he is.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Feast your eyes, Cap’n. All of ’em good
sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his salt
–</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: You owe me a boat.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor devil had his
tongue cut out –</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: – so he went and trained the parrot to do the
talking for him, nobody knows how. Nobody knows the parrot’s name,
neither, so we just call it ‘Cotton’s parrot.’</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and
fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost
certain death?</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your
SAILS!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Mostly, that seem to mean ‘yes.’</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Shut up, before you lose them all!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: These are the only ones worth having. And
we’re going to need them-</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: That fool will have us lose the canvas, and
the masts besides!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Werd best drop canvas, sirl</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She can hold a bit longer.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: What’s in your head to put you in such a fine
mood?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re catching up!</p>
<p><strong>twigg</strong>: Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta, off the port
bow!</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: Orders, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Bring her in, not too close. I won’t brave
the reef, not until high tide. We lay anchor before dark.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: … that is, if it first doesn’t sink back
down to hell from where it came.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Jack’s compass, cradled in both hands.
Jack leans over and studies it – almost like he’s praying.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bear three points starboard.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Six points port!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Left handed-ropes are coiled against the sun,
or it’s bad luck! Anty-clockwise.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Now, lad, just because it don’t point north
don’t mean it don’t work. That compass gives bearings to the Isla de
Muerta, wherever it may lie.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Really? So … what’s the story on the
pistol?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: I’ll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an
honest streak in him, and that’s where the whole problem starts. This
was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What? He never told me that.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Ah – he’s learned, then. Plays things more
close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.
Somehow I he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a
crew, promised each man an equal share. So, they’re forty days out, and
the First Mate says, everything’s an equal share, that should mean the
location of the island, too. So Jack gave up the bearings. That night,
there was mutiny.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How did he get off the island?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My body’s still there, rotting away, and I am
but a ghost!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: How did you get off the island?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah, that’s a dark and unpleasant tale, best
left untold.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wait – what about the pistol?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will,
he’s given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or
surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thirst – the
option of that pistol begins to look good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But I survived. And I still have that single
shot. It’s meant for one man. My mutinous first mate -</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Hah! Be mindful of pits and crevasses.
Stay together.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Careful, mate. Fall down there, you’d die
and miss Judgement Day – for not even the Lord himself’ll come look for
you here.</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND
ho!</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: How does he do that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’ll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your
wind, and keep to the weather of the island -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The curse drove you to gather this?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Depends.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: On whether the stories are all true. If they
are, that’s a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop
to an underground lagoon. If not -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – well, too late.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Chalk one up for the stories.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Here we stand before the cursed treasure
of Cortez himself. Won by blood, it demands blood in return.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You know the first thing I’m going to do
after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: What was begun by blood, let blood now
end!</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>deadeye</strong>: I don’t feel no different.</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: How do we tell?</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: You’re not dead.</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: No. He shot me!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You. Maid. Your father. What was his
name?! Was your father William Turner?!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Where’s his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that
medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?!
Where?</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: You brought us the wrong person!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: She had the medallion! She’s the right age.
She said her name was Turner!</p>
<p><strong>twigg</strong>: You brought us here for nothing?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: If any coward here dare challenge me, let
him speak! Any more talk, I’ll chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the
watery depths!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re in league with Barbossa!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I’m – rescuing you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You?!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Miss Swann! We’re here to rescue you! It’s
going badly!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m glad we got here in time.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Truthfully – you were a bit late.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The trick isn’t getting here, it’s getting
away.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll lead them away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go to the opposite end of the island, and
signal the ship. I’ll keep ’em busy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you sure? Jack – this is not something you
have to do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sure. When you’ve led the kind of life I
have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales
a little.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I invoke the right of parlay, according to the
Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and
Bartholomew…</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: I’m inclined to kill you now, Jack
Sparrow, without so much as a word, if you don’t lose that grin from
your face.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The woman’s blood didn’t work, did it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know who’s blood you need, to end the
curse.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Say the name, or I slit your throat.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Now. No, don’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Allow me the humor of listening to your
terms.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Simple. I have something you want more than
anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have
something I want – more than anything.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: The Pearl? Oh, that’s fine. And just how
do you expect this to work?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you
need.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: That’s your offer? You, sailing away nice
and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: I’m supposed to … trust you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m a man of my word.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You see, I’ve got this honest streak in me –
in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there’s the fact that you have
no choice.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: I’ll torture it out of you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You left me on a desert island – what worse
can you do?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Blast you! I’ll throw you in prison.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait as long as you like.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You’re setting me up for a double cross,
you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s say I tell you the wrong person. What
would you do?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Track you down and -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And if I tell you the truth, you become
mortal, and you won’t come near me because you know I’d kill you.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Jack, I don’t trust you, and that’s a
fact. Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: See, that’s where we’re different. I trust you
… to do what it takes to get what you want.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You’re playing this as close to the edge
as any man, I’ll give you that.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Pintel … set sail. If this fool plan is to
work, we’ll need the medallion, and that means catching the ship which
brought ’em here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What – you don’t have the medallion?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: That fool woman took it. You be careful
around her, Jack – she’s pretty enough, she’ll steal your heart – but
pure evil inside.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll watch my back.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow’s quarters, nice
and fine … in the brig. Meaning no disrespect, of course.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Two women on board? A man don’t have to be
superstitious to know that’s trouble.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: … you were in danger … so I took the
medallion. And I’ve kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that
they needed my blood. And it didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why would my father send this to me?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: To keep it away from them? No pirate
would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: If I had known-</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: – then we never would have met.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I can’t believe he would make such a sacrifice
for us.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I guess you can never truly know someone
else’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Shift your heading, steer clear of that
island. Fifteen degrees starboard.</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men
tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: Can we outrun them?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Not a chance. Make for the reef.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: What’s he doing? Is he going to run her
aground?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Drop the forward anchor!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: All hands! Prepare to come about!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying
scoundrel - I’m a little conflicted, here.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Strike your colors, you bloody
cockroaches!</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: Looks like they mean to send us under.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: There – she’s raised the Jolly Roger,</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: It’s a signal. If we resist, it won’t just be
death. There’ll be torture as well.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’re not going to just surrender!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We can at least fight – we might be able to
kill a few-</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Will – it’ll go worse for us – for Elizabeth,
especially – if we fight.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board,
you played me right clever, make pretending and all. I hope your stay
this time is more pleasant. Boys, show her some hospitality!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She goes free!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: What’s in your head, boy?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She. Goes. Free.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You’ve got one shot – and we can’t
die.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You can’t. I can.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap
Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. You need my blood. And on my
word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones’
Locker!</p>
<p><strong>twigg</strong>: It’s true - he’s the spittin’ image of old
Bootstrap. Even talks the same!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Looks like you’re back to having nothing
to offer.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: And hers got Old Bill’s courage. A curse on
him, and you!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Enough of that! Name your terms.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Elizabeth goes free!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: We got that part. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. I f
you agree… then… I will remain with you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Will – you can’t trust him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You must swear by the Holy Bible.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Eh? You have my word, then – on the Good
Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Boatswain! Take your captives belowdecks.
Chain them in the galley, and teach ’em how to row.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Hah. Look there. That’s the very same
island we made Jack governor of on our last trip. When you sail the open
sea as long as I, you learn to trust the signs fate sends your way.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Amen to that…</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Jack, Elizabeth … I’m a man of my word and
you’re to be set free, right quick. Men, break out the plank!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No! You gave your word!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your tongue.
Those as know me know I wouldn’t cross my word, and bring down bad luck
on the ship. I agreed to set them free. I didn’t say when. .. nor
where.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s pure evil to make a Captain walk the
plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of
it.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league
distant. It’s a square deal all around, and you can’t hope for
better.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You’d best take a swim, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The last time you did this, you left me a
pistol, with one shot.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: That’s proper, sir, according to the
code.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: By the Powers, you’re right! Where’s
Jack’s pistol? Who’s got it? Bring it forward!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing
as there are two of us, this time.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Tell you what. I’ll give you one pistol,
and let you be the gentleman, an’ shoot the lady, and starve to death
yourself! That is, presuming you’re not both drownded.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: So how did you get off that island,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can go to your grave not knowing.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: That’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Here – it will go well with your black
heart !</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I will not walk into the ocean. You’ll
have to throw me in!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Have at her, lads!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You went back for that? We need to head
for the reef!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s the second time I’ve had to watch that
man sail away with my ship.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The surf line. Elizabeth’s feet leave
prints in the sand … and then meet up with matching footprints she made
earlier, going in the same direction. She has walked all the way around
the island.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not all that big, is it?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Has it changed since the last time you
were here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The trees are taller.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I hope you have no intention of using
that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this
island – immediately!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What is that? Is there a boat under
there?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What? What’s wrong? How will this help us
get off the island?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It won’t. It won’t, and so we won’t.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: But … you did it before! Last time -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Last time, I was here a grand total of three
days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by,
and I bartered passage off.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But from the looks of this, they’ve long
been’out of business, and so that won’t be happening again. We probably
have your friend Norrington to thank for that.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So that’s it? That’s the secret grand
adventure of the infamous</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Welcome to the Caribbean, love.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You should look at our contretemps this way:
we’ve got shade trees, thank the Lord. We’ve got some food on the trees,
thank the Lord again. And we’ve got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay
alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships,
and our chances are fair.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: A month? Will doesn’t have a month! We’ve
got to do something to help him!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re right. Here’s luck to you, Will
Turner.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t be thinking I’m happy about this,
Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that
which I can do nothing about.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not when you can drink instead, at
least.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And you will call me Miss Swann.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Drink up me hearties, yo ho…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What? What was that? Something funny, Miss
Swann? share. Please,</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Nothing … it’s nothing. Just … I’m
reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none
I’d teach a child. Let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, no … it’s silly. Back in England we
didn’t know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and
daring -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That was before I met one, of course.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, perhaps … with a bit more to drink,
I might …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: More to drink!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we
loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We kidnap and ravage and we don’t give a
hoot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho -</p>
<p><strong>jack/elizabeth</strong>: Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate’s life for
me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I LOVE this song! Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate’s
life for me! We’re beggars and blighters,</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When I get the Black Pearl back, I’m going to
teach it to the whole crew, and we’ll sing it all the time!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’ll be positively the most fearsome
pirates to sail the Spanish Main.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not just the Spanish Main. The whole ocean. ..
the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. That’s what a ship is,
you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That’s what a
ship need_ … but what a ship is – what the Black Pearl really-is … is
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to
be trapped here on this island, all over again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah, well… the company is better than last
time. And the scenery has definitely improved.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ve got a few bottles left … and we’ve yet
to tap the kegs.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: To freedom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: To the Black Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing? You’ve burned our food,
the shade – the rum!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, the rum is gone.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: One, because it is a vile drink that
turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That signal is over a thousand feet high,
which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.
The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me – do you think there
is even a chance they could mass it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You – you burned up the island, for a one-time
chance at being spotted?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Just you wait, Captain. In an hour, maybe
two, keep a ‘weather eye open’ and you’ll be seeing white sails on that
horizon!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Elizabeth, I’m” relieved you’re safe.
Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time.</p>
<p><strong>elizabetii</strong>: Commodore, you can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: You’re speaking up for him again?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He can locate Isla de Muerta – but I
doubt he’ll be willing to help us from the brig.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We had time to get to know each other.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de
Muerta.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No. The pirates have taken Will -</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Your father is frantic with worry. Our
mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do.
Mr. Turner’s fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in
piracy.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Commodore, please!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: By remembering that I serve others, not
only myself.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Commodore, I beg you – please do this …
for me. As a wedding gift.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I am to understand that you will accept
my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not as a condition – a request.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to come
about. He’ll give you our heading.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Congratulations, sir.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my
proposal.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I know now where your heart truly
lies.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And now I know… where yours does, as
well.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: You may seclude yourself in my cabin.
I’m afraid we do not have any ladies’ clothing aboard.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Then I can wear men’s clothing.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: That would hardly be proper.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a
some cabin, 80 I suppose it’s going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles
for the remainder of the voyage!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Murtogg, take our guest below, and find
her some trousers, and a shirt.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: That ain’t going to work. That’s the gun
deck above yea</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What happened to William Turner?</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He
threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but
turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found
Cortes’ treasure, and its peculiar condition. He thought we deserved to
be cursed, for leaving ol’ Jack to the fate we did. That’s why he sent
off a piece of the treasure – to you, as it were: so it would never be
recovered, and so cursed we_ remain.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And then he ran. And he’s hiding out someplace
where you haven’t been able to find him.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: That’s a nice thought, to be sure, and I
wager your da wishes he’d thought it hisself. But, no. See, what he’d
done, _ didn’t sit too well with Captain Barbossa … so he chained a
cannon to his legs and dumped him over.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill, was his
face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of Davy
Jones’ locker. It was only after, we found out we needed his blood to
solve the curse. That’s what you call ironic.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Bring him.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You didn’t tell Commodore Norrington
everything.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nor did you, I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He might delay the rescue … and that
would be too late.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: These men will be facing an enemy that
seemingly cannot be killed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle
will be decidedly brief … and one-sided.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What’s your plan?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Elizabeth – below decks. I will not
compromise your safety..</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my
quarters, and make sure she stays there.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I don’t like the situation, mister
Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a
disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How
about you let me go in alone, and while you’re setting up an ambush,
I’ll trick the pirates out to you.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: You would do that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They left me stranded. Twice. What have you
got to lose?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Nothing I wouldn’t be please to be rid
of.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I knew you’d listen to reason!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That chart I drew up’11 get you past the
reefs. If you’re steersman’s good enough, that is.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I’ll be at the wheel myself.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll slip in, talk them into to come out, and
you’ll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: No reason to fret. It’s just a prick of the
finger and a few drops of blood.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Turner blood doesn’t flow pure in his
veins. Best play it safe, and spill it all.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: I guess there is a reason to fret.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Careful, now. You could fall in and still
be wonder’n when you’ll hit dirt.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You deserve to be cursed – and remain
cursed!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Blast him! A pox on him, and his father,
and the whole damnable line! Fan out! Find him!</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink
UP me hearties yo ho!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you have any idea where you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t talk. These caves magnify sound. Just
follow me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you certain this is the right way?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s the right way.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Thank you, Jack Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You couldn’t have led him back more
directly if you knew exactly where you were going.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You did know where you were going! You did
lead us directly to them! Why?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: What was begun by blood, let blood now
end!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You don’t want to be doing that.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: No, I really think I do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Why don’t I want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless
is lying in wait in the harbor.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: - - and its guns and crew will cut you and
your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Do you believe him?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: No. But him I believe. He is genuinely
angry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ve no hope of surviving Norrington’s
attack … that is, if you’re mortal.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: What’re you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Simple. Don’t kill the boy yet. Wait for a
more opportune moment.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like after you’ve killed… Every… Last … One …
of Norrington’s men.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: I can’t help wondering, Jack, why you’re
being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn’t end 80 well
for you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The situation has changed.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: That so?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Aye. See, after you’re done with the Royal
Navy, you’ll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you’ll
be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course
you’ll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who’s to argue? The
Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the
seas.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give
you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at
tea parties and brothels as ‘Commodore Barbossa.’ Do we have an
accord?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now, you can take care of the Dauntless,
right?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Men! Are you up for it?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Mr. Pintel, select five men to stay here.
Take the rest of the men out … not through the caves.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s … another exit?</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Aye, for us there is.</p>
<p><strong>tall sailor</strong>: Ship rats. Big ones.</p>
<p><strong>short sailor</strong>: Hate those things.</p>
<p><strong>short sailor</strong>: Taste all right, though.</p>
<p><strong>tall sailor</strong>: That they do.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns on
the beach, and set your aim. Wait for my signal, we don’t want to spook
them.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Which would you prefer first, good sir -rum,
or wine?</p>
<p><strong>big-bones</strong>: I believe I’ll have a spot o’ rum, if you
don’t mind, and thank’ee kind sir!</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: All the men in place, sir. Ready to
fire.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Wait for my order – what the blazes is
that?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Men! Take cover!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’ve been planning this from the beginning.
Since you learned my name.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, please – do I really seem that clever?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Use it well.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Confound it, Jack – I was actually
beginning to like you!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Steady, men! Remember – we’re the
Navy!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: What is happening out there?</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: They’re on our side! Take heart, men!</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Just so you know, Jack – I don’t think
you’re that clever. I think you’re a fool. A mortal fool.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Remarkable how often those two traits
coincide.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: You can’t beat me, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, isn’t that interesting.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re so pretty, I just couldn’t resist
stealing one. It’s a curse, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be
two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment
Day?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Or you could surrender.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Or I could chain you to a cannonball and
drop you in the deepest part of the ocean, where you can contemplate
your folly forever.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: Hah. Ten years you carried that pistol,
and you end up wasting your shot.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He didn’t waste it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, you’re the worst pirate I’ve ever heard
of. You’re a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can
It betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The worst. On the other hand, maybe I’m a man
who can’t pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard
who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean – twice!
– and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that’s a great pirate.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re all right!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Miss Swann – are you wearing trousers? And how
did you get off the island?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for
how we got off the island – ah, that’s a grand adventure, but now is not
the time to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: There. And don’t you dare tell me that
wasn’t a proper kiss!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Elizabeth, I think it doesn’t matter- that we
are of a different class -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It doesn’t!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: – but that was not a proper kiss.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This is a proper kiss.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tough luck. I was rooting for you.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: …and though I do say so with regret, the
law is clear. The penalty for piracy is death by hanging.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of
the boy. It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere
desire to do good, at great personal risk. It seems to me, that in the
rare occasion where the right course is committing an act of piracy,
then an act of piracy is the right course! So in my capacity as
Governor, I intend to grant a pardon to –</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Jack and his crew have escaped! There was
no damage to the cell … they must have been set free.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: The Black Pearl!</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I don’t think that will be
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: A day’s head start. That’s all he
gets.</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: Captain Sparrow – the Black Pearl is
yours!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!</p>
<p><strong>anamaria</strong>: Aye, aye, sir!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail - you
and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and
ship-shape!</p>
<p><strong>the end</strong>: FADE OUT and CREDITS ROLL</p>
