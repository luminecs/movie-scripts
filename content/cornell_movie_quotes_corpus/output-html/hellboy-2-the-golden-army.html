<p><strong>manhattan. 10.30 p.m.</strong>: Park Avenue in mid-December.
On the lampposts, Xmas lights sparkle over streets slick with slush and
rain. Limousines line up for a public function.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood’s auction house</strong>: Under black umbrellas,
wealthy men and women exit the limos and enter a stately ten-story
building. On the facade, a sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF
PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE. A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the
corner. His features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the security people
at the door.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: I’ll go up first. You’ll enter from
below- He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin and a
huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right hand is missing
and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A plume of breath escapes from
his brutish mouth.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: And remember Wink-</p>
<p>****: Don’t be shy. He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs
the wall, up, up, like a bat. Five floors up…</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in
granite and has been dated circa 700 B.C. Like the guests, the
AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear. TV MONITORS display the image of
the statue so the bidders can have a closer look.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: We’ll open the bidding at two hundred
thousand dollars. A DISTINGUISHED BUYER raises his hand-</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Two hundred and seventy-five, and… we
have three hundred, thank you Mr. Van Hausen - Three hundred thousand
once- A FEMALE BIDDER raise her hand-</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: And Three hundred and fifty thousand,
thank you Mrs. Bernstein- As the auction carries on, a STEWARD leaves
the room and heads down -</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: What the h- Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY
FIGURE covers the steward’s mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the
steward’s mouth has</p>
<p><strong>vanished!!!</strong>: The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless
man by the lapels, hauling him outside and dangling him over the void.
Far below: a spiked wrought-iron fence.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: A silent human- almost as good as a
dead one…</p>
<p>****: Almost. He releases the STEWARD, who falls-</p>
<p><strong>-down-</strong>: -down- TKKCT!!! Flailing in utter silence.
All the way. Onto the fence. The Figure slips through the window and
moves into the-</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: And now, for our next item. Lot #777.
Two STEWARDS wheel in an oaken box and open it. Nestled in maroon velvet
is an eight-inch, ornately decorated arc of gold.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the
first time in auction. A piece of the Royal Crown of Bethmoora… A
precious artifact dating from the Atrebatean period. Exquisite
workmanship in 24 carat gold. The lights flicker briefly, provoking
MURMURS from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Please- please- ladies and gentlemen…
may I have your attention. As I was saying, observe the fanciful
creatures adorning the outer surface, figures from a lost mythology… The
lights go out completely. From the sudden darkness, the Shadowy Figure
speaks up.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: Lost- ? Not at all. Forgotten by you
perhaps, but very much alive.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy 2 4</strong>: A few emergency lights come on,
revealing The Shadowy Figure, who walks down the aisle to confront the
auctioneer.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Sir, would you please identify yourself?
I see no badge or-</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: Shall we just say that I am the
rightful owner of this piece? He seizes the artifact. The auctioneer
grabs a phone and hits a button.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Security- Call Security- This is an
outrage- An- The SHADOWY FIGURE reaches into his pockets and throws a
handful of seeds at the Auctioneer’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: -Outrage of- KRRRRR-K the seeds sprout
into massive, thick branches and roots and instantly engulfing the
Auctioneer amidst coils of wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and
grow until they crack the ceiling!! Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and
in its place stands a compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from
its branches and crawl around the trunk. CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS
come flying through the side doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!!
The spectators scream. WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on
his back. On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the metal.
People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and disbelief. WINK
shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a CLANG!!!! Inside them, little
clawed THINGS are scrabbling - mewling, fast and hungry!! At the Shadowy
Figure’s signal, the troll opens the cages… and the people’s SCREAMS
redouble.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: May this remind you all why you once
feared the dark… A multitude of eyes glint in the darkness, rows and
rows of tiny teeth shine greedily. They lunge at CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Hey, Fishstick- We gotta talk.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune to
suppress. And then, naturally, they pop up on the net. CAMERA moves in
on Abe’s breathing apparatus. It’s sleek, more modern, fitting snugly to
his gills and neck. His goggles are new, too. He examines a photo of
Hellboy bounding down a city street, brandishing his mighty,
high-caliber Samaritan. He’s looking straight at the camera lens.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, Lord- He’s smiling in this one.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: I know- It’s not just the money. It’s the
provocation. This is asking for trouble. His ego- Manning leans close to
a voice-recognition security mike.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: “Man-ning…” He enunciates each syllable
perfectly, then turns to Abe.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: -is out of control. And I think it’s all
deliberate on his part.</p>
<p>****: He hates me. Layers of steel doors trundle open in
sequence.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: No, he doesn’t. He’s just- enthusiastic. As
they approach HB’s room…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: How are things between him and Liz?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, you know. The usual. Since they moved in
together- Good days and bad. On cue, the concrete wall explodes!’.! A
massive BALL OF FIRE swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it
off its hinges.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Then again, there are the really bad days-
Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion dies away-
Hellboy’s revealed, lying on the floor, his back smoking and in
flames.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, hi Blue- Manning- He puts out a small
flame on his forearm and steps into the room.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy’s voice</strong>: Well- I’m not afraid of you! You
hear?? Abe and Manning peek inside-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Look- I have one rule! One- “Don’t touch my
stuff -” Liz appears, shimmering in a halo of blue flame. HB’s pulls a
few LP albums out of the garbage bin.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You have the same album on CD, LP and an 8
track- An 8 track!!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You can’t listen to Al Green on a CD!! You
just can’t!! Oh, and 8 track was the way to go- one day mankind will
realize its mistake.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What about me? I need some space! Not much, but
just enough to find- to find- my- toothbrush. She flares up, losing
control…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Is that what this is about?? Your
toothbrush’s right there, behind you- There- there- with the cat food!!
Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from a heap of
spilled cat kibble.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Damn it, Red- there’s no room for me here. You
can’t just act like- Suddenly, the alarm SOUNDS. Hellboy is elated.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, heavenly bells are ringing!</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Oh, Jeez- did you see the crowds? He offers
HB a couple of cigars and lights one for him.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: This is midtown Manhattan… Will you promise
to be careful? You’ll use discretion?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Piece of cake. In and out… no one will see
me. You have my word- A sarcastic guffaw from Liz.</p>
<p>****: I can be discreet if I want to be- They exit the truck and
enter the building. Manning sighs.</p>
<p><strong>14 tnt. sales room - night 14</strong>: A BPRD agent , Abe
and Liz move into the big, dark sales room, past a jumble of overturned
chairs. They use plasma-screen night-vision scanners to survey the
devastation.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No one here. No survivors. No bodies.</p>
<p><strong>15 tnt. corridor - same 15</strong>: Two agents lead the way
down the adjacent hallway. Hellboy follows, a few feet behind. HB trains
his flashlight on a fallen display case. Broken glass glitters.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Same story here, babe-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Don’t call me babe-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I said “Abe”- I’m sorry- wrong channel-
Hellboy falls back to talk privately on the intercom.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Liz- UM-?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p>****: When we get home… I’m gonna clean the place up; okay? Even the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: That’s not the problem and you know it.</p>
<p>****: What? You want to get rid of the cats? You can’t mean that-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No. That’s not the problem either-</p>
<p>****: Then, what–?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Not now, for God’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Red- I’m afraid I do detect some activity- As
the agent and Liz inspect the other iron cages, he extends his webbed
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What kind of creature?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: There’s more than one-? He hears a
scratching noise.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: More- Many more-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: How many- ten-?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: No. Maybe a hundred- or two-</p>
<p><strong>mppf-</strong>: As HB nears a wall, it bulges and splits
open!! The ceiling cracks, too. He hurriedly loads a pair of
lever-action</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: They’re all around us- Sounds of MOVEMENT from
burrowing, unseen creatures-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What are they???</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Uh- If I’m right, we should leave now and ask
for backup.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: The situation is completely under control.
Earlier tonight, customs agents discovered a few illegally imported
items. This caused a minor confrontation. The reporters go wild with
questions.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Federal agents have now taken over the
premises. We ask that you all step back- Manning basks in the flashbulb
glow and acknowledges a pretty young REPORTER.</p>
<p>****: Yes, Debra-?</p>
<p><strong>20 tnt. corridor - night 20</strong>: Plaster spills from
widening cracks in the wall. Hellboy shoots, blowing open a massive
hole. He peeks inside- Small bodies burrow away like moles.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What are they-? Abe?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Ah, I knew it.</p>
<p>****: They’re vicious and cruel and- The floor ripples with
activity.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Have you noticed the floor??</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Uh- thick rug, deep pile, light brown-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Red- there is no rug- Hellboy lifts his foot,
realizing he’s been walking on an inch-thick layer of- ahem- poo.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Aw, crap-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Precisely…</p>
<p>****: These things have a very active metabolism. They, um- excrete
as soon as they eat and then need to eat some more. There are no corpses
’cause there are no</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Spit it out, brother blue. What are
they?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Alright, but-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Damn it Abe, just tell us!</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Okay, then- They’re- um- tooth fairies.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Abe, c’mon- cut the crap. She checks her boots,
sticky with poo-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Third century, the Teutoburg forest. Famished.
They feed on calcium-</p>
<p>****: And they do go for the teeth first. How do you think they got
that name “Tooth Fairies”?? Liz senses movement in the darkness. She
holds out her hand and starts a small fire on her palm. She pans it like
a torch, firelight sweeping the darkness-</p>
<p><strong>agent marble</strong>: Hey, this guy is cute -i. He reaches
out to touch it.</p>
<p><strong>agent marble</strong>: Are you scared, buddy? Across the room
Hellboy sees the Agent nearing the Fairy.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No, don’t- The thing SNARLS, leaps and
sinks its tiny teeth into MARBLE’s finger. Then it dives under MARBLE’s
shirt and goes to work. MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of
creatures emerge from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble’s
clothing. Gasping, he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig in..
ribs crack… blood spurts. The agent falls.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, my-</p>
<p><strong>liz!!</strong>: In reply, he hears a faint scream. He bats at
the things with the SHOTGUN, wading further into the room.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Liz!! Where are you - ?! He sees a horde of
little beasts gnawing at the metal bars of a cage… .Liz cowering inside.
Hellboy just has time to look deep into her eyes. A quick moment of
silent communion.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Do it, Liz, do it!!! And Liz obeys. Closing
her eyes she-</p>
<p>****: The fire’s not my enemy. It is part of me- -gets covered by a
gentle film of blue flame.</p>
<p><strong>uh-oh-</strong>: He takes refuge as-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It is mine- -the gentle flame blooms into a
cloud of fire. Liz goes supernova. BAMMM!!!</p>
<p>****: Evidently we have a- gas pocket- somewhere in- The reporters
stampede towards the explosion, leaving Manning alone and fuming.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Hey guys, hey guys, come back!!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Red, Red, this way- Hellboy kicks the critters
away, shooting again and again.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No- I’ll deal with them- NOW. He dumps his
backpack and pulls out a belt full of VULCAN 66 grenades. Holds it
high.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Vulcan 66, boys! Come and get ’em- Liz and
Abe take cover on the stairs. They see Hellboy luring the tooth fairies
toward the windows overlooking the street.</p>
<p>****: No, Red- Not there! Move away from the-
K-B00000MMMMMM`IN!!!!!!!!! A massive explosion-</p>
<p><strong>29 tnt / ext - auction house 29</strong>: Like a cannonball,
HB flies out the upper floor window. A ball of flame, he arcs downward,
covered in fighting, writhing fairies. Below, the onlookers scatter as
the massive Red Giant lands in their midst, cracking the pavement.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: HB?? HB?? Are you alright??</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Gee whiz, Manning-</p>
<p>****: I guess we’re out now.</p>
<p><strong>32 credits 32</strong>: Behind the CREDITS are caballistic
engravings suggesting the power, size and weapons of a mystic,
mechanical GOLDEN ARMY.</p>
<p><strong>west side railyards. midnight</strong>: Demolition has begun
on abandoned factories and rail sheds around an old ROUNDHOUSE. A sign
reads: COMING NEXT SUMMER,</p>
<p><strong>three points shopping mall.</strong>: CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to a
guard shack.</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: Check it out. That guy’s make-up is so
fake. I mean, come on, solid red- Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: And what’s with his forehead? Is that
goggles? He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
standing by the gates.</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: Hey, we got us a wino. He grabs his
nightstick and steps outside.</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: Hey- buddy- get the- The THE SHADOWY FIGURE
whirls and drops his coat. He unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the
air around the guard. The guard’s shadow in the background is cut into
three parts and collapses.</p>
<p><strong>bammkm ! ! ! !</strong>: THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his
sword over the crumpled remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching
can be heard. WINK emerges from behind the shack.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 19</strong>: Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE
vaults the chainlink fence and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes
the fence and follows him through.</p>
<p><strong>chamberlain</strong>: Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
follow me, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>chamberlain</strong>: I beg you, your majesty. Before
entering the chamber you surrender your sword.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I will not.</p>
<p><strong>chamberlain</strong>: Then, I regret to say, you may not see
your father. It is the protocol, sire. For peasant and prince alike.
Please- for the last time- surrender your sword. A tense beat and then
the Prince relents. The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him
down-</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
weapon. He will wait here- WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted
through a huge, rusting iron door.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>sister-</strong>: The KING gestures for him to rise.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Why have you done this?? His voice trembles
with anger.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Why? ! The Prince looks at him, defiant.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I have returned from exile to set us free.
All of us, Father- And to reclaim what has been taken from our people.
The land and the freedom that is rightfully ours.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: No- You have broken a truce that has lasted
for centuries.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can you
abide it? How- ? They have no respect for themselves, their Gods or the
earth-</p>
<p>****: And they scorn us- every time they raise a dead, cold building,
destroy a forest, or take more land- The PRINCESS then steps
forward.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: What they do is in their nature. We must
honor our side of the agreement-</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Honor-?</p>
<p>****: Look at this place. Is this where you hold court??</p>
<p>****: Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their filth, in their
rubble??? Picking at scraps from their table??? Where is the honor in
that??</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: And what would your solution be-? War?
Why?</p>
<p>****: It may just be that our days are ended…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: It may be- but we will not go quiet. We will
not fade like this. Better to burn than fade away… And for this… Prince
Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of the clans.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: .we’ll need the help of the Good… the Bad…
and the Worst- He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds
it high. The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the companion
piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: No- you cannot be that mad-</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Yes. I am.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: This is the path you wish to take? Knowing the
cost?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Yes, Father- it is. The King takes the
Princess’ hand and mournfully lowers his head.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
choice. Death. His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.</p>
<p>****: I agree. Death it is- And the guards turn toward the king and
stab him. The Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to flee, but
are kept at bay by the other guards.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
that have already seen the light- Seen the future… The PRAETORIAN GUARDS
cover his back as he leans forward to his Father”s corpse and snatches
the medallion.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: As for you- You may join us in our quest or
die now- His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces seamlessly into
an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: All of those in favor, make it known.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 23</strong>: All of the family heads sheepishly bow
their heads, then kneel.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Good- I see the council is as brave as it’s
always been…</p>
<p>****: And now, my sister- The Prince looks around and sees that his
sister is gone. He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the
door.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Find her- Find her- His minions surge into
the tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>40 tnt. tunnel maze - night 40</strong>: Clutching the
medallion on her chest , the Princess runs down a tunnel. A CROWD
gathers behind her, chasing her as she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down a chute. She
lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No- no- you fools-</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Yrdrig!! YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a
tank, jumps out from an alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them
ferocious. In seconds, he’s upon the TROLLS. Each of his many mouths
tears into green flesh, lifting and shaking the helpless monsters like
rag dolls. The Princess slips through a secret door.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy on tv</strong>: Yes- yes- I’d say I am that strong-
I’ve fought many creatures over the years but none as strong as me- He
winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 25</strong>: Hellboy plunks himself down next to
her, popping a can of beer.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I think I did good. And I looked good,
don’t you think, Liz? Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote
controls.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Look- there’s Manning… He raises the volume as
Manning is shown, surrounded by microphones.</p>
<p><strong>manning on tv</strong>: Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
somewhere in-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it. The door
opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box overflowing with
mail.</p>
<p><strong>please-</strong>: Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV’s.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you
hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun. Only Liz-</p>
<p>****: Only Liz handled herself with any dignity.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No one asked me anything. Manning pulls a
fistful of mail out and tosses it on a table.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Don’t bother starting a fan club. It’s
trending five to one against us.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Against?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Polls- protests- hate mail- Liz grabs a few
letters and scans them.</p>
<p>****: “Unwelcome species… mongrelizing… lower orders… ungodly
freaks…” She glares at Hellboy.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Ungodly freaks-? Us?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: You really did it this time- I’m under
review. But so are you- As of today, there’s a new team leader.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: New - ? What?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Yes- You heard me. A new team leader. We’re
to meet him at the conference room at 0900- Now.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What’s the matter, Manning?? Don’t you
trust me anymore?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Oh- I never did- But after last night,
Washington wants a new public face for the BPRD-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What about me? What’s wrong with my
face???</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now
you’ve ruined it all-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: But, who-? Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: How would I know? Evidently, he’s quite the
big shot- His name is Johann Kraus-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Akkk- Kraus??? He’s German-</p>
<p>****: -a physical medium, head of the European branch of the
BPRD-</p>
<p>****: You know I have a problem with Germans-</p>
<p>****: -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult Practice from the University
of Munich and a very eloquent speaker-</p>
<p>****: -Germans make me nervous-</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: I guess they need a nice open face- A face
people can trust. Finally, next to steel cage, they meet-</p>
<p><strong>johann kraus</strong>: about 6’ tall, dressed in a canvas
containment suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick
latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his head…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: . Oh, my God-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 28</strong>: .is a translucent glass bubble, full
of gas! He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the Fairy
Cages. Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Johann Kraus, at your service. His unearthly
voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing. Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers
as Kraus’ fishbowl head turns toward them.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That’s an open face for you…</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Poor things, bought and sold on the black
market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages. Let’s see what they can
remember-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die-
-but maybe I can be of help- Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an
amulet.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Oh, no, no- No amulets are required. He
adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the
lock.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Exactly. A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out
from his fingertips, slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter
the- -“Dead” Fairy.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I can briefly take control of entities, both
mechanical and organic and reactivate their neural system- The “dead”
Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two more do the same from
another pen.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: You scare him- The fairy blabbers furiously
while glaring at HB.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of
my tail- Yes, you-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Rough translation: He says you are rude,
brutish and not too bright-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Touche. More high-pitched jabbering… Johann
replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Enough. it seems our little friend here
remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise in the last place where his
cage was traded: market sounds-</p>
<p>****: Troll language-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: The troll market- ?</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Exactly, Miss Sherman. The Fairy starts
babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and weak.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Jeez- your buddy there doesn’t look too
good.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I’m losing my grip on its limbic system- He
feels nauseous. I’m afraid he’s about to die-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Wow- You have that effect on me too. The
Fairy’s cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses. Ectoplasm escapes
its body and regroups at Johan’s fingertips.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: How can we find the Troll market??? Its
location has been a source of speculation for centuries</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges- And
Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist- places it under Washington
Bridge</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: We’ve looked there before– Staked it out for
weeks-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Yes, but this time I have asked for a very
special piece of equipment- He moves in to a large crate marked “Lot
336”</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: “336” The schufftein glasses??</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we have
this clue- He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: In my mind we have enough to go by- Any
questions?? Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises
his hand-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Yes- what is it?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: If you’re really German- how come you don’t
have a funny accent?</p>
<p>****: Get ready. We are on the move.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What a moron!! “We are on the move” He
thinks he’s so hot!! We’ve been looking for that place for years and
we’ve never found it- You said so- Abe pulls out TWO headsets of
COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of copper and glass, full of buzzing and
whirring pieces. He tries it on.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Get used to it. He might be here for good-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: For good?!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: He has a nice voice.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Yes, very commanding, very soothing.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I think he’s a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I like him.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Well, then you’re a jerk, too. “The brains
of the operation-” give me a break!</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: They head towards the garbage truck.
Manning, Abe and are waiting there.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I think you feel threatened… Hellboy stays
behind- thinking- thinking real hard.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Ha! Me? Threatened?? Glaring, at Liz:</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: By whom? By him??</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Not just him- this whole thing you did. The TV-
the reporters-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I did that?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes, Red- absolutely. ’Cause you did it without
thinking- You just wanted to be in the public’s eye- well- you’re there-
but so are we.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey- We got some hate mail.</p>
<p>****: We’ll deal with it. Together.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 33</strong>: He comes closer to her.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Something else bothering you-? Liz nods
quietly.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: So- Tell me about it-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I will, but not now- I’m sorry if- I-</p>
<p>****: I don’t like being watched. I never have. I feel like a freak
only if someone’s watching me. Suddenly: Angry YELLS… then fists
pounding the walls and fenders. The doors open and they are inundated by
reporters and TV CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally,
hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan, UK,
Germany…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: May I suggest that tonight you refrain from
signing autographs.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It’s the garbage truck. It makes the wrong
statement. About who we are.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: You think that’s what this is about?
Transportation???</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: C’mon- show us your powers-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh- No, no, no, it’s not a parlor trick.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: What are you, a mermaid??</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, goodness, no- I-</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: You say you can read things- things
about people- so read me- c’mon- read me- The crowd of reporters and
onlookers laughs and applauds.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Very well, if you insist. You… keep… a large,
battery-operated vibrating egg by your bedside… A shrieking CAMERA CREW
runs up loaded with video equipment.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA
test?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It’s “Hellboy” not “Demon-man”- One of the
projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy gazes back at them-
seething.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Let me take care of this. Johann bravely
confronts the news teams and the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann
Kraus and I beg you to allow us- -Please, we need space to work-
please-</p>
<p><strong>we-</strong>: The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He
signals for silence.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: In due time- very soon- we will provide all
the answers you require, all the whos, whys and wherefors- But for now-
An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Great P.R… He gets ready to pummel the
crowd. Liz stops him.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Shh! Give him a chance…</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: -it’s been a long… long time… for many
decades really, that the BPRD has served you- all of you… in silence. We
have waged an unknown war - but a very real one. Heroes have died
unrewarded and unrecognized so that you might go about your daily life.
To work, to marry, to bid your children goodnight. Little by little, the
crowd grows quiet.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: In exchange, we have been consigned to the
lies and racist innuendo of the tabloids. And there we have lived
without complaint - until now.</p>
<p><strong>54 montage</strong>: Johann’s speech is replayed in broadcast
TV VANS, HOMES, PUBS and BARS all over the world to a fascinated human
population. All colors and creeds.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: But perhaps soon- after learning of our
hardships and sacrifices, you may decide that our humble lives may, in
some way, have a value… and a meaning-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I pray that you will allow us to defend your
good fortune- to guarantee the blessing that is a peaceful night’s
sleep. A night free from monsters and nightmares. And if so- If so- then
all we ask in return… from you… is a little respect and the chance,
remote as it may be, to prove ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in
this- God’s Earth.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: This is sooo corny- A moment of silence
ensues– Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds- Liz
applauds, Abe applauds. Hellboy is agog!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What-?? What-??</p>
<p>****: He has a nice voice. All business now, Johann steps over to the
group.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Come on. We have work to do-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Nothing yet, Sparky, over-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I read you, Red. Keep looking- Manning is
bored, looks at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Looking at what, for goodness sake-? What
do these things do-? Liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses
and prisms. Both Abe and Johan wear similar gear.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of
Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical sets with the intent of
photographing fairies in England…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Let’s get out of here- We’re never going to
find it-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy’s voice</strong>: Hey- Sparky, I think we got one.
Manning studies the image on the monitor: a bag lady pushing a shopping
cart full of cats-</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: That? Oh, please, she looks as sweet as she
can-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Red, turn on the “antiglamour” filter… Fairy
folk use a spell called “glamour” to seem human and nice-</p>
<p>****: These lenses allow you to see their real appearance…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 38</strong>: ,,f 58 EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT
- NIGHT 58 Bellboy turns a few knobs on the goggles, then raises
them.</p>
<p><strong>59 pov goggles.</strong>: As a series filters enter the
visual field, the bag lady transforms into an ugly, muscle-bound
troll.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Oh, dear Lord.</p>
<p>****: What about the cats?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: She eats them.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: “She??” That’s a “she”?????</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: We’re moving in, Sparky-</p>
<p><strong>61 bowling alley / back alley/ under the bridge 61</strong>:
HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service</p>
<p>****: Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Bowling balls- they give me trouble.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: How about a beer, then? Now that we’re
“out”- Whaddya say, Mein Herr?</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Sorry. I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>johann’</strong>: Adjust the prisms to “2” Abe moves his
glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own- unsuccessfully. Now the WHOLE ROOM
transforms under the new optical elements: Its geometry remains somewhat
unchanged, but instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large,
mossy rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree trunks and
stone columns are visible…</p>
<p><strong>there-</strong>: Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty
mechanical lock.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What the heck is that?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: A locking mechanism-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Mmh- I’ll take care of it- He clenches his
stone fist, rears back…</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: No- You destroy it. We’ll never get in- He
adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the
lock.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Johann’s s ecto-tendrils enter the-</p>
<p><strong>64 mechanism of the lock</strong>: -filling it, making a few
complex gears turn and move-</p>
<p><strong>65 the lock</strong>: Opens and the floor drops away,
revealing a stone staircase. Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils
and closes off the valves.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.</p>
<p><strong>67 market stall</strong>: The woman inspects a pile of
ancient bric-a-brac at a market stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly
revealing her face. It’s the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings,
her beauty is transcendent.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 41</strong>: Abe is thunderstruck. As she turns to
leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her bandaged arm: a bracelet
adorned with the seal’s coat of arms!</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Brother Red!!</p>
<p>****: Not now, Abe. As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe
hurries after her.</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Never seen anything like it. No one
sells `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe. Behind him, there’s a
faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and gnarly ogre, his naked chest
crisscrossed with scars, his feet encased in iron shoes. Growling, it
bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hiya, Chuck-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: What about this?? Do you recognize this
seal?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 42</strong>: The shop owner’s face suddenly grows
pale.</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: You’d better go. Now.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Please. We’ll make it worth your while. The
shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps forward, ROARING.
Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: He’s not friendly- Hellboy huffs and
walks up to the creature.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Well, neither am I- BAMMMM!!!!! With a
single uppercut, he sends it flying toward the ceiling, shoeless. The
shop keeper watches in awe until it lands, about thirty feet away in the
middle of the dogfight. The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures
attack the thing with blind instinct. Hellboy grabs the shop owner by
the lapels and pulls him close. The shop owner’s head rockets back and
forth like a boxer’s speed bag as HB “gently” slaps him around. Teeth
fly everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Feeling more chatty now??</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: It’s rumors! … just- No- don’t hit me,
all right? There’s talk of a revolt- a revolt against the human world-
Hellboy releases him, then looks around.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Where the hell is Abe?? He pushes his belt
locator-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 43</strong>: 1.,,,d 71 INT. TROLL MARKET ALLEY MAZE
- NIGHT 71 The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe
stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates to purchase a
silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a safety holding case. The
SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands him a gold
bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to her. He extracts the
cylinder from its holding case and hands it to her. A red locator light
flashes on Abe’s utility belt.</p>
<p>****: Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I’m following a lead, Red. Keep your locator -.
A large TROLL cuts him off-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Excuse me- What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p>****: Are you in trouble? Talk to me, Abe. Another TROLL comes up
behind Abe.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I don’t think you- The TROLL opens a small
wooden box and extracts a nasty looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, my- The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug
- like a bullet - into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug
lands on Abe’s chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He
groans.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Abe? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 44</strong>: Abe tears it loose and crushes it
underfoot. But his vision blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face
first, onto the cobblestones.</p>
<p>****: Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit -</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: If you are looking for your weapons, my
guards took them. Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few
feet away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in fine silk
robes. She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large, featherless
REPTILE/BIRDS.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure
you…</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Why were you following me? Abe is ashamed
to realize the real answer. He’s utterly beguiled by her.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Are you seeking to join my brother?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Your brother-??</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: In his revolt against the humans?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely
mistaken… He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere,
barking and growling.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Then answer me truthfully- Why were you
following me?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: My name is Abe Sapien -</p>
<p>****: There is no such name!</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I beg
you. I am an agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. If
we can assist you-</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Give me your hand. Abe complies, thrilled
as she runs her fingers over his palm. The Princess’ face brightens. She
smiles and gestures for the YRDRIG to yield.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Down Yrdrig - he’s a friend. The YRDRIG
jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all three tongues.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Yrdrig’s really just a puppy. The drooling
beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw.</p>
<p>****: Nice puppy…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and
gives him playful shake.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave
our guest alone- The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig! As the animal skulks
away, she helps Abe up-</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: My name is Princess Nuala.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Your highness, the honor is all mine.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: May I apologize, Mr. Sapien, for the
manner in which we brought you here… couldn’t be too sure. She offers
him the locator belt.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy,</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: And under diplomatic immunity - may I seek
asylum??</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: We would be… honored, I’m sure. But, may I ask:
from whom do you seek asylum? Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door
flies off its hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile
fallen guards outside.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Red, no! I’m all right! The Princess shrinks
back, but Abe motions for calm.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Gentlemen! Some respect, please! The Princess
looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards. The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz
around HB, who swats them like mosquitoes.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: And that was my royal guard.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Red, apologize at once! We are in the presence
of… royalty! Hellboy’s never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a
schoolboy.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: You’re vouching for her, I take it. Mr
Sapien?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, most definitely. She’s from an ancient,
noble line -</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: - of warriors. The Children of the Earth.
I’m sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a fierce bloodline, we cannot take
your claim of allegiance at face value. He produces the ANCIENT
SEAL.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Human side, two nights ago- The Princess
studies their faces.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: In ancient times a seal like this was
delivered to the enemy as a declaration of war. A signal from the
underground realm to the entire world. It prefaced the awakening of the
Golden Army- Johann sits down heavily.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I feared as much.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What-? What-? A goblin army-? Johann shakes
his glass head, overcome with worry.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There has
been nothing to substantiate such a</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Not a tale- At the dawn of time… Even
before the great flood, man and the Children of the Earth shared this
planet… But as man in his greed expanded his dominion, there ensued a
bitter war…</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: In those days, my people were led by my
Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of Elfland. KING BALOR fights
valiantly at the side of his son, the tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE
NUADA.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: The bloodshed went on year after year.
Many lives were lost. An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun
sinks below the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: It was then that the King ordered the
Sigri to build him a new, invincible army.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: This was an army that would not eat, drink
or grow tired. A heartless, ruthless force made of the purest metal,
mined from the depths of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: The Sigri worked until the winter moon was
high in the sky - The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved
segments of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN
directly over the King’s head.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: I am King Balor, leader of the Golden Army. Is
there anyone here who disputes my right??? Silence. Prince NUADA kneels
next to his father. The Goblin crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In
response- TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing
him.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: But this army knew no bounds, had no
remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in blind battle with man, woman or
child. The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through armor
as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise. The army marches
ever onward, like a grinding machine devouring tender flesh. At length,
there is no sign of life in the human camp.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: And as the king gazed upon the earth awash
in blood and at the impassive metal faces of the army he had created,
his heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at too high a price. This war
should never have been waged. The King surveys the carnage. The
mechanical soldiers stand in symmetrical ranks awaiting further
instructions.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
men would keep to their cities and we children of the Earth would dwell
within the forests. This pact, he declared, would be honored by our sons
and the sons of their sons until the end of time. Listening to his
father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: But my brother did not believe in the
promises of men. He marched off into exile, vowing to return if the Sons
of the Earth ever needed him. Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying
sunset.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: And the golden army was ordered to lie
dormant, locked inside the earth itself - and there it is to this day,
waiting for the wearer of the crown to command it again.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Where is that crown??</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: My father had it destroyed. Cut into three
pieces. One for mankind… She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which
dangles from a chain around her neck.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: .Two for the sons of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: So, you do need our help..?</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: I’m afraid it’s the other way around. She
holds the CYLINDER she purchased.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: The location of the Golden Army is
contained within this cylinder– She opens it and produces a parchment
hidden inside. She extends it: the map just shows three coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Just a global chart, Edo - that’s the old name
for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here-</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: But nothing else- She rolls back the map
into the cylinder.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: So far, this is a family matter. To
intervene will bring nothing but trouble.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Good, I like trouble.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: No- not that way. Too risky- They’re lost
in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: There. Stairs to the street…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hold! The Prince appears at the top of the
stairs, dressed in black. He’s surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping
to the rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can you
recognize a traitor? She’s here to betray her own! He casts a disdainful
look at Hellboy.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I’m here to recruit all of you against the
humans. Make your decision now. Those who join me will be rewarded. The
rest… will be killed. A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the
sound of CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
unclenching his fists and stretching his neck. He starts up the stairs,
but a couple of the GUARDS leap down to block his path.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I’m gonna put this as delicately as I
can.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Look out, Manny! Strike city..! CRASH!
Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting the clawing monsters
right behind him! As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures
pour out into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way free,
only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK. Abe, shielding the
Princess, demonstrates the way of the water, a fluid martial arts
display. He ducks and parries the blows, leaping like Nureyev. Abe
scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at the Prince’s
guards. He manages to knock a couple off their feet. As they get back
up, he uses the available bowling pins as clubs. The screaming PATRONS
rush for the doors.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Help me…! Please, somebody..!</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: Oh, my God!! Oh, my- Roll! Roll on
this!</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: It’s not what you think -!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: He’s lost his mind! He’s worse than any of
them..! CUT BACK to Hellboy, revealing that the old lady is actually</p>
<p><strong>wink.</strong>: Liz runs over with a prism from the
SCHUFFTEIN GOGGLES and sticks it in front of the camera lens, revealing
the truth. The reporter checks his monitor.</p>
<p><strong>86 street fight 86</strong>: ALL the BPRD team, including
Liz, is swept up in this fight. The denizens of the troll market
overturn parked cars and knock down lamp posts, ROARING with
excitement.</p>
<p>****: The fire is not my enemy– it is a part of me– Liz yells out a
warning… and then throws a barrage of flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like
THINGS shrivel and burn. Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until
only his legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT - he
brings it down on the head of the nearest creature! WINK and HB duke it
out for a few beats and then HB finally vanquishes the Troll, Ripping
his Iron Mace off and throwing it away. As the other monsters retreat…
.the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical GRENADE.
Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over to the BPRD truck.
The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse, screaming,
renewing the panic.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I will find you, young daemon - - and you,
too, my sister. Meanwhile, here’s a taste of what lies in store.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 55</strong>: He throws the grenade. Hellboy dives,
just in time to catch it. He’s about to throw it down a sewer, when he
listens to its clockwork innards then: PING!!!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It’s a dud, your royal assness - ! The
Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: How do you like that? Just when I was
loosening up. Then… CLACKK!!!. Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it
opens up like a beans. flower… and spews out a handful of Brightly
colored</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Pick them up!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Abe. relax- It’s jumping beans… Abe is
scrambling to retrieve them.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Do as I say! With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a
few.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: How many do you have?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Three, how about you?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Three! There’s always seven! Find the last
one!!!</p>
<p><strong>to</strong>: The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops
closer edge…</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Quick, it’s going for water! Hellboy reaches
for it… but it’s too late. The thing hops into the manhole and lands
somewhere below with a SPLASH.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, my God, evacuate the area!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Abe, please, get a grip. A RUMBLE from
below their feet. WHAMMMM! A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement,
overturning cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping
up through the Bridge overpass!! Picking up speed, the tree branches
soar up, up, up… into the moonlit clouds. Hellboy approaches the
massive, trunk, gazing up in fascination. Birds and creatures emerge
from the inside and flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a
moment Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Whoa. Just like the story books. Manning
and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING climbs on Liz’s
shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her “ala”
SNOW WHITE. A small crowd starts wandering into this idyllic
scenario.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: This is so beautiful-</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: So- perfect- so peaceful-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey!!! He spots. the prince, at the base of
the tree. Knocking on it-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh-
Jeez did you have to do that?? Liz starts pulling Manning away and
yelling at the crowd-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Back- Go back- right now!!!</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: What? What? What is he doing-?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: He’s knocking on wood- summoning an</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: An elem-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: A forest spirit that lives in that tree. He’s
releasing it-</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Oh, and is it that bad?? KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!!
The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under some enormous force. Huge LEAVES
tumble to the street. Even the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a
huge shape descends. BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled,
dormant</p>
<p><strong>elemental.</strong>: Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE
ELEMENTAL steps out of the tree and stares at Hellboy. Uttering a weird,
guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight, turning his
baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks back, her pet Yrdrig rushes
at the thing, snarling. In a single leap, it sinks its teeth into the
Elemental’s heel.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Good dog. Now, Woody… You want to fight
someone, you fight with me. Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as
in Bruce Lee. The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his
limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: This may not be the best place for you, your
majesty. With your permission… He offers the Princess his arm. She takes
it and allows Abe to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental
smashes the ground where they had been standing! Every time the
ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and branches. The roots
connecting to its feet and leading to the original tree trunk, like an
umbilical cord. Johann sees this-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I have a plan- He looks at Abe-</p>
<p><strong>87 standing at the garbage truck 87</strong>: -as the fishman
helps the Princess up into the rear of the BPRD garbage truck. Up front,
behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder? The
Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him, barking in
frustration. Hellboy’s RADIO crackles:</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: So, lead him to the bridge. Hellboy looks
over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn Bridge in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That’s nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: You’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What’s at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz? Hello???
No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing neon sign
reading “Hotel”. The Elemental smashes the letters “tel”… so Hellboy
climbs the “0” to the roof.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Johann - they’re almost here. Johann moves
among massive construction machinery. He stops at a stack of heavy
SPOOLS OF CABLE. Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Yes. I had the very same idea… He gets behind
the levers and handles of a complex machine which holds a half mile of
steel cable.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: .but how do you operate this??</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: If you’ll permit me… Johann opens his
fingers, and plunges both arms deep into the mechanism! Instantly, the
diesel engine STARTS UP.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Stand back, Abe. A hydraulic strut lifts the
spool, then pitches it through the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable.
It splashes down near the far shore of the East River.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the other
side. Quickly, Abe!</p>
<p><strong>94 in the water 94</strong>: Abe races down a pier and dives
smartly into the dark water. Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like
toward the Manhattan shore.</p>
<p><strong>95 brooklyn bridge - docks 95</strong>: Hellboy makes it to
the bridge… as, behind him, the Elemental wades into the river, pushing
aside boats and barges.</p>
<p><strong>96 in the river</strong>: Abe makes it to the other side,
surfacing with the cable, towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast! The cable
is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I need more!</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: No more available! The Elemental’s feet
stomp through the river; he stumbles as he encounters the submerged
cable.</p>
<p><strong>97 underwater</strong>: Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged
down, down down… past rusting cars, oil drums… and a couple of rotting
CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement! Suddenly, Abe’s head strikes a
sunken truck, knocking him unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.</p>
<p><strong>98 at the bridge</strong>: As Hellboy climbs one of the
bridge towers, he hears someone calling out from above:</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Haven’t you managed to kill it yet? You, who
were so eager for a fight? The Prince is standing on top of the tower.
He points at Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Over here, dear friend… SNATCH! The
Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy wriggles in the massive
wooden finger-like appendages.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 62</strong>: The Prince walks to the edge of the
tower, near a steel spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: This might be a good chance for you to come
to your senses. Help us.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I’ve been all through this! The answer’s
still no! Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable, bringing
it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a steel snake! The cable
forms a huge loop, splashing down near the Elemental and tightening
around his ankles. The cable</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i He points at
the roots trailing into the river. Liz concentrates and a bolt of fierce
white-hot energy pours out of her hands, burning the roots at the
Elemental’s feet. Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of
the river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he tosses
Hellboy high into the air. On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay
and swings back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
Elemental’s back, right behind his head.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Nap time, Big guy- He raises his stone fist
and hits him straight in the back of the neck. The cable tenses- -The
Elemental pitches forward- The Prince looks up to see the Elemental
falling right at him; his mouth opens as if to scream… The Elemental
goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop the bridge… exactly where
the Prince had been standing. Putting an end, it seems, to both of
them.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 63</strong>: The Creature dies, but even as it
does, its branches embrace the steel structure and grow, Ultimately,
blocks and blocks of the city are now covered in trees and grass and
mossy leaves… A strangely beatific and precious change. Liz runs up,
looking out at the river as Abe emerges, bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz
and Johann embrace firmly, laughing and happy to be together. Abe eyes
the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at him… Hellboy meanwhile
observes the group from a distance, jealous, alone.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: You’ll permit a small criticism? You take
too much time to aim, to think. Nein. Just point- like afinger- as if
you wish for something.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, I wish for something. Johann brings his
target close: a beautiful, tight cluster of shots, dead center.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Speed is of the essence. You must work on
it. I’m willing to spend some - Johann reaches for his loader,
accidentally knocks Heliboy’s onto the floor.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey, watch it! You’re winding me up, I
don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: On the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You keep wiping that thing like she’s gonna
care.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: She- Who-??</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You know who- She-</p>
<p>****: She’s not gonna care.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: You think I’m after Liz, don’t you? Well,
I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p>****: Not good enough for you? Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist
and comes up behind Johann.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Well- From now on, you don’t come near her.
You don’t talk to her-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: You forget. I’m part of the team now, such
interactions are inev-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Well- you better start making them
“evitable”-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: That’s not a word-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Yes, it is-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: No, it isn’t- Hellboy raises his stone
fist.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Now it is-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That’s how
you win an argument.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I try.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Well, you’re big, I’ll give you that
much-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: “Give me???”- You don’t give me sh-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: -and you’re strong- but you’re slow.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Slo-??</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Very- slow- I’ve seen your fighting style.
Very slow- WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive
fist. To his surprise, the Johann’s glass ball cranium shatters!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Slow enough for ya-?? With a loud HISSS,
Johann’s odd suit sags to the floor!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Ow- Johann… buddy. Sorry- I- I- got carried
away… Johann? You still hear me? An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from
the suit and penetrates the closest locker.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It was an accident, okay? I’ll get you some
help-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 66</strong>: With a CLANG! – the bank of lockers
comes to life! Metal doors smack Hellboy’s head repeatedly, like a
pinball machine! his face imprinted in the metal.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: See? Speed is the key. The vaporous form of
Johann’s body emerges from the lockers and wanders away. The locker room
doors open and close as he goes by. Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and
sits.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Chicken shit!</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: “I sometimes have a queer feeling -
especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
frame.”</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I love this part. Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: “I am afraid that cord of communion will
be snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding
inwardly.” She closes the book, looking troubled.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I was
born. It would have been a great privilege to have known her…</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: This “Jane Eyre”… I understand it’s only a
story, but such a tie that binds, it exists between me and my brother. I
assure you: my brother, he’s not dead-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: How can you know? We all saw-</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: We are twins. Even now, I can sense his
presence. This has been our way since we were young children, in
Renvyle-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Renvyle, Ireland- The ancient isles-</p>
<p>****: A magical place in the West. A different time. Long gone. Now,
he’s near and he’s looking for me. I can feel and even understand his.
hatred for mankind.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Men… usually mean well, I believe that. But
they need our help and patience.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: You were very brave, vouching for me. How
do you know I’m not the enemy, bringing me here?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: It’s as you were saying, I suppose. From
intuition, feeling. I’ve never met anyone like you… but that’s my
instinct. They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles
swirl out of Abe’s gills.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: He caught me off-guard- but I’ll get him
next time. He’s examining a few letters, contract forms, etc.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: There shouldn’t be a “next time” we’re all part
of the same team.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: We are- he’s not- The guy’s an egomaniac.
You can see right through him.</p>
<p>****: That’s a joke, Liz. Liz remains silent.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series,
based on me? And this: Product endorsement - breakfast of demons. And a
videogame!!! As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the
volume up.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It always gets
me- Red- There’s something I need to-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No, wait. Look that’s us- Jay is showing
some footage from the giant incident.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: So- this “Hellboy” what is he?? Is he really
on our side?? I mean, he’s red, has a tail and shaves his horns- horns,
Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a good sign.</p>
<p>****: Ha- He’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Maybe we should have him come over and talk to
us a little, uh? Whaddayathink?? The crowd roars.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That’s a great idea, don’t you think??</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No, I don’t-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Did you know that during the commercial
breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the guest can’t talk to Jay… keeps
the conversation fresh.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: How do you know these things?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I read it in TV Guide.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You’re really liking this, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: We should do this-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It’s a bad idea. All of it- Do you really need
everybody to like you?? What’s in it for you?? Are we not enough??? She
leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted in a ballerina
costume is jumping around with a red ball balanced on its nose. Hellboy
chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Are you alright-? Liz nods weakly.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: May I be of assistance??</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: He’s a big brute, isn’t he?? Liz
chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: But he has a good heart. I know it. He means
well.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I think I may have made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: In what way, Mein Frau??</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Just a mistake- nothing important.</p>
<p>****: But sometimes being with him is not easy-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: It never is. I know. Lis looks at him with
renewed interest.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I was married once. A long, long time ago…
And only after I lost her- I realized that my life would never be quite
the same- And my loss lead me to become what I am today… Johann’s human
face materializes inside his glass helmet.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I- I tried constantly to make contact with
her-</p>
<p><strong>104 flashback - circa 2001</strong>: Johann’s mouth opens and
out of it emerges a large tendril of ectoplasm. His neck engorges and
the substance continues to flow freely out of his mouth and
fingertips–</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: It was only there- in the Ethereal plane
that I ever gazed upon her again… CAMERA close in on several ceremonial
candles burning in the room. Their flame illuminating the eerie
scene.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 71</strong>: Out of the mouths of the other guests,
emerge other, equally large ectoplasmic shapes. They cross to-</p>
<p><strong>105 the ethereal plane 105</strong>: Once there- they reform
into humanoid shapes, vaguely reminiscent of their mortal bodies. JOHANN
floats freely, approaching another humanoid form in the void: That of a
woman, his wife.</p>
<p><strong>johann’s voice</strong>: But it was there, while he was
partially on the ethereal plane, that disaster</p>
<p><strong>struck-</strong>: He is about to embrace his wife’s form when
a horrible rumble occurs and the void bursts in flames, destroying and
distorting everything around him- His wife’s shape screams and
evaporates.</p>
<p><strong>johann’s voice</strong>: All the seance attendees were
incinerated. The only survivor -and only to some extent- was me- Why?
I’ll never</p>
<p><strong>know–</strong>: The form moves towards its body and attempts
to climb back and reanimate it, but the CHARRED CORPSE is barely amble
to amble a few steps forward before collapsing into ash and bone… The
shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost- Then, Professor TREVOR
BROOM wanders into the scene and approaches the form-</p>
<p><strong>johann’s voice</strong>: It was then that Professor Broom and
the B.P.R.D. devised a containment suit for me. A new body-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 72</strong>: CAMERA pulls back to reveal-</p>
<p><strong>107 balcony bprd - night 107</strong>: Johann, back in the
balcony, talking to Liz.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I owe Professor Broom everything that I’ve
become. He brought me back to life- He grows silent for a brief
moment.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: But I’ve never been able to see her again.
My reach became limited- My loss, infinite… Liz puts her hand on his
shoulder. Johann takes it…</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Loss- the very threat of it makes us
vulnerable… makes us care- You can see that, don’t you?? Without her I
became but an empty shell… Liz leans her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Don’t give up on him. Not yet. Liz
chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No. Not yet. CAMERA discovers HELLBOY, watching
them from behind a glass door, a six-pack in his hand. He steps
away.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Ah, hello Red. You’re up late.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Liz and I- we had a fight-</p>
<p><strong>oh-</strong>: Hellboy eyes the CD player.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Did I hear Barry Manilow just now?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no- It was er- urm-
Vivaldi. Il cimento dell’armonia I believe I particularly admire the
passage… Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe’s CD player. The music
stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What’s happening to you??</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Ooh- Ooh-</p>
<p>****: All my life I thought I was alone, a made- up name and a random
pasted on a cylinder. But then I saw her- She’s like me. A creature from
another world… Alone… Brother Red- I think I’m in love.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You say that like it’s a good thing. What
track?</p>
<p>****: Track eight-</p>
<p>****: Oh, God- you’re disgusting-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I know-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: “Can’t smile without you”</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I’d cry, but I don’t have the glands for
it..</p>
<p>****: What am I going to do, Red???? Hellboy sighs and pops a beer,
presses play and sighs heavily, looks around-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I miss him- Father- don’t you??</p>
<p>****: Everyday.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: He would tell what to do- He would tell what’s
right- what’s wrong-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: He did that for all of us… The opening
strings of “Can’t Smile Without You.”</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: You know? I- I never much appreciated Manilow’s
artistry that much- until now- Now it seems to be a grand poet and
speaks directly to my innermost feelings.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Jeez- You need to get out more- The two of
them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the syrupy music. Then,
slowly, the two of them start singing: low at first and then at the top
of their voices, moved and teary-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: This is a whole new ballgame and I want you
to take my lead.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I find these leather outfits very</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Maybe so, maybe so- but they look- hip.</p>
<p>****: When it comes to dealing with reporters or the public, I set
the tone. You all know the old saying: the perception is the
reality.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we can
ditch the garbage truck, right?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Wait, Red, the lab’s in it-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Screw the lab. I want new wheels.</p>
<p>****: You got ’em- The round a corner and enter -</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: A gift from General Motors. One for each of
you. Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy’s with scenes of Dante’s
inferno, Liz’s with flames and Abe’s with an underwater vista.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: This is more like it!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’m not driving that- Abe has opened the hood
on his Hummer.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The sheer
waste of precious fossil fuels…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: An American custom, it’s called product
placement! What’s the harm?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Every agent on the field is on the case.
They will solve it– Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a
flourish.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: There you go, pal. “To Jason, best wishes,
Hellboy.”</p>
<p><strong>fan</strong>: How am I supposed to read that?</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: You don’t like it?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 77</strong>: Irritated, he scowls at the fan.
Manning takes him by the elbow and leads him away.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That turns up on e-Bay, I’m gonna find you,
“Jason”…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Can you do anything about this… uh… -double
chin?</p>
<p><strong>makeup girl</strong>: No, you’re not being made up.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>makeup girl</strong>: They said, you’re too normal. You don’t
need anything.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: But- Believe me- I’m not normal at all…</p>
<p><strong>makeup girl 2</strong>: So, what color is that- green?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Carribbean Blue, actually. CAMERA MOVES to the
next makeup chair, where the very sexy Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches
Hellboy’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>makeup girl 3</strong>: Are these really scars?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Well, yeah. Each one tells a story- His
grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly gets up and
goes to them.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That about you, glass-man? A few squirts of
Windex?</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I’m not going on. And if I may- a word
of</p>
<p><strong>advice-</strong>: -it’s not a good idea to hint that you two
have… a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Thanks a bunch. I’ll decide that.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: You don’t know how people may react.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It’s a love story. They’ll lap it up.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I know you don’t like me, but trust me on
this one.</p>
<p>****: I knew your father- he was a friend- Hellboy blinks, taking the
information in.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn’t
have approved of your behaviour. A P.A. opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: You’re on-!</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I’ll be watching from the truck lab, where I
belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen minutes… He walks away.</p>
<p><strong>sign: patrovick station, moscow, 22.00 hours.</strong>: A
busy Moscow Subway station, not very crowded at this time of night.
Sleepy patrons await the arrival of the subway.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 79</strong>: One of them, a puppet vendor,
showcases his product. He manipulates a wooden marionette: A KNIGHT in
SHINING ARMOR. In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train
ROAR!!! The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves to
the edge of the platform alongside other passengers. The lights grow in
intensity and the ROAR becomes deafening. But something’s wrong, really,
wrong-</p>
<p><strong>puppeteer</strong>: Hooy na ny! The lights are in reality,
the eyes of a giant dragon and it roars into the platfrom, demolishing
pillars, crushing people and eating the puppeteer in a matter of second.
Pandemonium ensues.</p>
<p><strong>map: “moscow”</strong>: But Johann and the other agents are
too absorbed watching the Leno show on the bank of monitors.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we saw some
extraordinary things on TV. And tonight you’re in for more.</p>
<p><strong>118 tv show</strong>: Jay Leno grins and pulls his microphone
close.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Please extend a warm, warm welcome to Hellboy,
Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, and Special Agent Tom Manning. Uproarious
applause as the BPRD team comes out and make their way to the couch.</p>
<p><strong>lend</strong>: Wow, So - He’s pointing at Manning.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: .what planet are you from?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Washington, D.C., Jay. It’s hot and
inhospitable to human life.</p>
<p><strong>lend</strong>: Funny. Why are you just “Liz” and not Fire
Girl?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I was born in Milwaukee, so it was just plain
old Liz ever since first grade.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey, we do call her Sparky now and then. A
chuckle from the crowd. Hellboy smiles in satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>lend</strong>: And you, Abe. Is it uncomfortable at night
with that toilet seat around your neck? The Princess smiles as the
camera singles out Abe for a closeup.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Actually, Mr. Leno, my lungs are more like
gills. I need to convert the air’s nitrogen into oxygen, otherwise I’d
suffocate in five minutes.</p>
<p>****: Gotcha. We call that stand-up comedy.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: So, Hellboy: what’s your favorite food?
Devil’s food cake? Do you have a last name? More laughter at HB. Liz
mortified. She touches HB’s hand to restrain him. Cameras zoom in on
this.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Whoa. What’s that- Are you two an item?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Uh… I-</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Care to comment on that? Sounds like you’re
contemplating marriage!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You know, Jay, we are- together. We are. Rumble
of consternation from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Uh oh. Manning, I think your polls just
tanked. He turns to see the map- lit like a christmas tree.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Mein Gott-</p>
<p><strong>121 tv show</strong>: Leno smiles at the audience, which is
buzzing.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Folks, this is modern America. A guy in Rhode
Island married his motorcycle! What’s a little inter-species romance in
this day and age?</p>
<p><strong>liz:</strong>: Scattered BOOING from the back row. Jay turns
back to</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Okay, here’s what we’ve really been wondering:
Is he just like every guy? In every respect? I mean, he looks like a
guy…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 82</strong>: LENO and if so, are you using any
protection? A layer of asbestos might be in order, don’t you think? Liz
tenses up in silence. Holds tight to HB’s hand. Hellboy is ready to
explode.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: As a matter of fact, Jay- Before she can
finish, the production assistant runs out and hands a NOTE to Leno, who
scans it and grows serious:</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: We we’re getting pre-empted, ladies and
gentlemen. Please, bare with us. We’ll be right back- CAMERA PUSHES IN
on one of the MONITORS:</p>
<p><strong>announcer 1</strong>: This is a news alert. Tokyo is under
assault - repeat - this city has been attacked. Monstrous beings,
defying description, have waded into the Ginza- The jumpy, handheld
images are full of digital interference. The spectral BEASTS drag down
power lines and hurl cars.</p>
<p><strong>announcer i</strong>: - where police are helpless and
hospitals overwhelmed. One moment, please. Moscow… come in, Moscow…</p>
<p><strong>announcer 2</strong>: This is CNN in Moscow, where a Dragon
has laid claim to Red Square. Yes- a DRAGON.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 83</strong>: The DRAGON heads towards the TV
REPORTER and screeching, it raises its PAW.</p>
<p><strong>announcer 2</strong>: Oh, my God… CAMERA goes down, then the
picture winks out. Black screen. The HISS of static… PAN off the monitor
to Jay Leno, who sits in stunned silence, like everyone else. Finally,
he looks over at Hellboy.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Friends of yours?</p>
<p>****: No -!</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: Then, may I ask what you’re doing here?
Shouldn’t you be out protecting humanity instead of hooking up with our
women? At last, Hellboy explodes. Bellowing, he rips up the desk and
throws it through the backdrop!</p>
<p><strong>124 tnt. bprd - same</strong>: The Princess snaps off the TV,
looking worried. Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold
piece hanging from a chain around her neck. She closes her eyes and
shudders - trouble is near. The Yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers.</p>
<p><strong>126 tnt. library – continuous 126</strong>: A VIDEO
surveillance camera in the BPRD library records the Princess as she
crosses to Abe’s tank.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy 2 84</strong>: She hides the gold segment within the
pages of “Jane Eyre.” At that moment, the Yrdrig GROWLS -</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Shhh, it’s all right - BOOM-! A jolt
shakes the room. A-moment later, a wall collapses as warty, heavily
muscled ARMS and FINGERS tear at the masonry! in seconds, a squad of
TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK leers at the Princess. From her
waistband, she produces a long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly.
Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging. The Yrdrig shakes
himself into action and springs. With a SNARL, it attaches its several
jaws onto the nearest trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the
spiral staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice:</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hold. The Prince steps into the room,
carrying a long spear. The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to
kill him.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Come-! The trolls release the Yrdrig and
bound over to the Prince. The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by
the neck and brutally twists -! The animal’s three mouths yelp and
cough, fighting for air. - the It thrashes pathetically until, suddenly,
it’s over beast is dead.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Where is your sense of shame? You mingle
with… the liars?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 85</strong>: - a couple of dead AGENTS sprawled on
the loading dock.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: What in God’s name- ? Hellboy, Abe, Liz and
Johann race past him, disappearing into the building. The alarm bells
are deafening.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Princess! Without thinking, he darts forward.
Instantly, one of the trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his
chest-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Abe! No, get back!! Abe regains his balance
and tries again, his eyes glued to the desperate features of the
beautiful young woman. Hellboy manages to restrain him.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Mr. Sapien, don’t! He’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I’ll kill you all, if that’s what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No. Why don’t you just start with me?
Hellboy strolls up to the Prince.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You challenge-me?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You bet your ass I do-</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Your weapon of choice?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Five-fingered Mary. In the background,
Manning arrives, wide-eyed. Just in time to see the Prince hand off his
captive to one of the trolls. He drops back, flips his spear to
horizontal and waits for Hellboy’s attack.</p>
<p><strong>130 fight</strong>: Hellboy feints left, goes right and whips
around, swinging his tail at the Prince. The Prince leaps and jabs with
the spear, poking a hole in Hellboy’s coat. The surrounding crowd backs
away as the combatants circle each other. The Prince is nimble. The
Prince is quick. He thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy
into a display case full of antique weapons. The glass breaks and a
number of swords and axes fall to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Arm yourself! Use the flail!.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Not my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl.
He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to his knees; as
he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal combination. In the arms of the
troll, the Princess’ head rockets back and forth, as if struck. A moan
of pain escapes from her lips.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: H.B., no! Stop - you mustn’t harm him! As the
Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe, momentarily distracted-
Then-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 87</strong>: Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the
Prince’s SPEAR TIP is half-buried in his chest…! The Prince sneers and
gives the spear a savage yank, breaking off the blade! Hellboy’s eyes
roll upward; Liz SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he
collapses. The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans. His
eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy’s side.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: If you want to see her again, you’ll give me
what’s rightfully mine. Many people died for that crown. Bring it to me.
He and his trolls escape into the night.</p>
<p><strong>hb.</strong>: Liz is near panic.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Abe, stop studying! Pull the friggin’ thing
out, why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Liz, I’m sorry. It’s a magical alloy. Every
time I touch it, it moves closer to his heart.</p>
<p>****: Come here, I’ll show you… Liz backs away, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No! I don’t want to see it! We’ve got to do
something!</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I cannot reverse the magic- we have to look for
the Prince or somebody that can help Red.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Go after that son-of-a-bitch and get him to
reverse the spell!!</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: He’ll demand the gold piece-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: So? We find it! We give it to him-!! Manning
exchanges a worried look with a couple of his agents in the b.g.</p>
<p><strong>agent agate</strong>: A lupgarou loose in Picadilly, a Winged
creature nesting in a skyscraper- We have a situation in almost every
point of the map. Johann looks back at a map with LED indicators
signaling each crisis in the globe. They keep turning on a dozen a
second.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: The Rebellion’s spreading too fast- The only
way to stop it is to stop the Prince.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Any luck? Liz has come in behind him. Abe
quickly palms the precious thing in his webbed hand.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: No. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: No -?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No. Forget the gold piece. Let’s us just find
this royal asshole.</p>
<p>****: Fire and water, me and you, Abe. We’ll kick his ass. Abe looks
supremely troubled.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Abe, let’s do this for Red! Abe nods, unable to
find a good answer. He manages to tuck the gold piece into his belt.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: The map contained within the cylinder seems
useless-</p>
<p>****: Now the case itself proves very useful- He moistens the holding
cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat and imprints the surface pattern on
the paper map. Glyphs and coordinates become visible. A silhouette of a
twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her
brother were born there. They hold it sacred.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Even if you’re right, we sit tight and
locate the gold piece, make sure he never ever gets his hands on it. If
there’s any truth to this legend, the fate of the world depends on
it.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What about Red?? Don’t you care about him??? A
moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is
right: we can’t take the chance. Liz glares at him.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I see. Red was right about you. Welcome to the
team, Johann. And goodbye. She leaves the room.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Don’t worry, Sparky- It’s all going to
be</p>
<p><strong>alright-</strong>: Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks
at him, teary-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: We’ll make it alright. Screw Manning- You are
right, Liz- We should just do this together: the three of us. Liz
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Engine, starting- refer to NA-7488-BD… Liz
climbs in behind him.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: We stay here much longer, we’re gonna get
caught…</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Just a few more minutes. Here’s an easy way to
remember that “port” means “left.” They each have four- A NOISE from the
door: it’s Johann.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Good evening, friends.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Don’t try to stop us, Johann.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: On the contrary. I’ve been giving it some
thought, and we should be able to save Hellboy. After all, the Prince
lacks the gold crown. Without it, his army poses no threat. None at all.
Abe is very quiet.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Its useless- I- I- can’t- I can’t pilot this
thing… Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the
controls…</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I’ll give it a try- Abe smiles at the sound
of the engines starting up.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Sir - you’d better come, fast -</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Got it - ow! He burns his fingers on the
coffee as he hurries after the agents.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Not ALL of them, it’s not possible!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Isn’t that Johann at the controls?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 93</strong>: Sure enough, they get a glimpse of the
transparent head through the cockpit window. Abe’s there, too. He raises
a webbed hand to wave goodbye. The plane taxis outside onto the
runway…</p>
<p><strong>143 underground 143</strong>: The Prince pulls the Princess
through fractured, roaring tunnels. Here and there, the walls are
pierced, allowing light and ocean waves to enter. Rounding a few
corners, the Prince stops near a wall decorated with a large, elaborate
FRESCO. It shows a stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive
renderings of trolls, faeries and ogres.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Maybe this will help you remember who we
are, who you are… What our destiny is- The Prince pushes his sister
through a low doorway, out onto</p>
<p><strong>144 ledge 144</strong>: -overlooking a vast cavern, big as a
stadium, lit by a thousand torches. The mechanical ARMY stands knee-deep
in heaving seawater and foam.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: They - they - will be mine to command,
whether you like it or not. Only after our victory will you appreciate
my sacrifice… and yours.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 94</strong>: Massive granite mountains encircle an
impossibly green valley.</p>
<p><strong>146 tnt. bprd plane cockpit - day 146</strong>: Early
sunlight washes over Hellboy’s body, who weakly groans in Liz’s
arms.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Where are we, Liz..?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Near the ocean, Red.We’regonna make you well
here.</p>
<p><strong>148 sign:reynville,ireland. 148</strong>: The back doors of
the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: This should be the portal. By all rights-
Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Abe, bring the mapcase over here. He’s found
a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest branch joins the trunk.
Abe slips the map back into its crystal cylinder and holds it alongside:
it looks to be a perfect fit.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes! Try it, Abe-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Before you do anything… remember what we’re
in for. A world unlike anything we’ve ever known. Dangerous,
deceptive…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You’re wasting time! Abe inserts and twists the
cylinder. The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground,
bending them into a swaying arch.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Dangerous, deceptive… and hard to leave.
They walk under the tree roots, into…</p>
<p><strong>150 fairy world</strong>: A transformed landscape. A
perpetual nightland- Still overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing
with pale colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours. The men start down
the hill, into a valley bordered by a rugged coastline.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Renvyle is over there. They glance up and down
the beach, looking for a boat. Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air. A
GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the shallows directly
in front of them. By his side, sitting atop of a tree: A SATYR and a
CROW observe the group.</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you be
seeking safe passage to Renvyle?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes! Can you help us?</p>
<p>****: Careful, Liz.</p>
<p><strong>satyr</strong>: I’m sure you can come to an understanding!
The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the rocks. He’s
standing in the stern of a sturdy little coracle. Its wooden hull is
painted in Celtic patterns.</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: Room enough for all of you! Even your weary
friend.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: What will it cost, boatman? The Goblin
smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of triangular teeth.</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer. Abe,
Johann and Liz confer among themselves:</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>crow</strong>: He won’t want money.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: I have a… belt!</p>
<p><strong>of</strong>: Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it
in front the creature’s bat-like face.</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: I have no use for such a thing. Liz shows
him her binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Here… is a wonderful set of eyes, magic eyes
that will bring the world-</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: I already have binoculars! No, I see
something special. He points toward Hellboy’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>satyr</strong>: Under his bandage - ! Quick as a squirrel,
the creature hops to Hellboy’s side and brings out a KNIFE! SWISH! In
one sweep of the blade, he reveals HB’s terrible wound, and the speartip
protruding from it.</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: That! That - in exchange for your
crossing!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Don’t you touch it - ! She rushes to Hellboy’s
side, pushing the Goblin back, ready for a fight. The Goblin shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: Is it so precious to you? Let me pull it
out.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: You mustn’t. One touch can kill him. The
Goblin’s eyes grow wide with understanding.</p>
<p><strong>goblin</strong>: Ah. I see. We must go to the Angel of</p>
<p><strong>crow</strong>: He’ll know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 98</strong>: Strange BIRDS hang upside down form
the Cave’s roof. A MASSIVE CHIMNEY has been carved out of the cave’s
rock at the other end. A Black, ancient figure is hunched there, warming
its skeletal hands by the fire. A raspy voice utters something in an
ancient language. The Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who
collapses on the floor. In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near
the crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR BLACK WINGS
and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale, eyeless face.</p>
<p><strong>angel of death</strong>: So. This one… The boy- I remember
him well! Anung-un-Rama!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, my God. She knows - ?!</p>
<p><strong>angel of death</strong>: I helped bring him into this world -
in my fashion. It pulls a set of a glowing, red-hot TONGS out of the
fire. It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in Hellboy’s
flesh.</p>
<p><strong>angel of death</strong>: I warn you: it is his destiny to
rule over the destruction of the Earth. Not now, not tomorrow - but some
day. You are sure you want him to live?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes, I say yes-! Abe and Johann exchange a
silent, worried look.</p>
<p><strong>angel of death</strong>: Very well, then- but let it be said:
The day will come when you will pay the price fire girl: This will bring
you and the world much sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: And I’ll deal with it when that time comes. Now
save him. The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody point from
his chest.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 99</strong>: The ANGEL OF DEATH holds up the
speartip and looks at it with distaste.</p>
<p><strong>angel of death</strong>: Harmless now. See - ? Hellboy’s eyes
flutter open.</p>
<p><strong>angel of death</strong>: Sleep now, child. Your strength, it
will return. A guttural HISS from the corner: the Goblin is jumping up
and down, pointing at the speartip.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Our ferry captain - he wants his
payment…</p>
<p><strong>angel of death</strong>: Ach, outside with you! She tosses
the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up and bounds out the door.
instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around him,
chattering in excitement over the latest prize. She gazes down at
Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on her. He smiles wanly.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I almost lost you- Hellboy smiles and grabs her
hand-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I thought you were mad at me.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Well, no one can stay mad forever.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I’m sorry for all the attention, I thought
it would be good for us.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: We’re never going to make them all happy, Red.
What we have is ours and no one</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: I can turn my back on the world. I don’t
care anymore I don’t- as long as you stay with me- as long as you think
I’m still a good man.</p>
<p>****: Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I??</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes you are. You are the best man I’ve ever
met.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You still seem sad. Is there anything you
want to tell me-??</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes, there is-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I’m
ready.</p>
<p>****: Is it about Johann-</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No- no- what are you talking about?? Before she
can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice and fresh rags.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Abe and I have found the entrance to the
Golden Army’s resting place- Liz come with us- You should stay behind
and get some rest-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: And call you in the morning, right?? Like
Hell I will. I’m keeping an eye on you,</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: There. Abe points at the violent sea
below-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: The only way in- I’m afraid we’ll have to jump
in- Can you make it-? Hellboy nods.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Strange. If this is the entrance-</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I know- Why isn’t there more security?? With a
ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around Bellboy’s neck!
The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles around
Hellboy’s neck. The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK’s
MACE destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects twice
with Hellboy’s head. But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the
chain in two and twirling the mace like a boleador.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 102</strong>: He hits Wink again and again-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!! Hellboy grips
the chain, pulls the creature close, then, like a weightlifter, raises
him high overhead. With a mighty GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard.
WINK hits the jagged rocks once- twice- thrice-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Ouch- ouch- ouch- We better go swimming
before any more ugly fellas show up- He stares down into the swirling
waters and discreetly takes his hand to his bandaged side: He’s
bleeding. The wound has re-opened.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Red, are you-?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Don’t say a word, Blue- Let’s move on-</p>
<p><strong>156 underwater</strong>: Johann plunges in from above, his
body quickly tumbled by the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy
are in the water, too. Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness
of the cave entrance.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Hang on, people. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>158 underwater</strong>: Johann dives down to find a rusting,
iron LOCK six feet under the surface. He tries to turn the control
wheel, but can’t make it budge.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy 2 103</strong>: Seconds later, Hellboy is at his
side, gripping the wheel in his huge hands. Using all his strength,
Hellboy finally manages to turn it. His bandage, however, floats free…
and his wound opens up, emitting a plume of blood. Lungs bursting, he
shoots to the surface. Johann stays behind and swings open the lock,
revealing…</p>
<p><strong>159 a stairwell 159</strong>: .carved from the living rock,
leading upward into the depths of the cliff.</p>
<p><strong>160 stairs - later 160</strong>: The trio cautiously climbs
the stairs, finding their way with light sticks. Hellboy stops to lean
against the wall. He dabs at his chest with a rag.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hold up. We need to rest.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Says who? I’m fine, I tell ya. He lurches
forward, pushing past the others, fighting off his pain.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: This was a mistake. He’s -</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Mein Gott– The stairs lead to-</p>
<p><strong>162 among the soldiers 162</strong>: Hellboy leads the way
down a row of gleaming statues, pausing to gaze up at the blank face of
one of the infantrymen.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey, amigo. You got some gum? Two rows
away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that terminates the arms of
each soldier.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Most ingenious. A versatile, highly mobile
killing machine.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Make that machines, Johann. I see more than
one. Hellboy taps on a soldier’s mechanical chest, which booms faintly,
sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Wow. You hear that? Listen - He thumps it,
harder. The mechanical thing rocks backwards…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Uh oh. CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the
soldier behind it! Then,</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Whoops. The sound dwindles, then builds
again as ANOTHER LINE of falling soldiers bears down on them!! Liz
screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash past them until
- - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the head of
the column.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: As a boy, they say I enjoyed toy soldiers.
So do you, I see. He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to
kick aside some of the weapons.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You’re bleeding. Most unfortunate. Hellboy
wipes at his oozing chest wound.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Yeah. Now it’s your turn.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Do you envy these contraptions? They never
bleed. They feel nothing. Not even the zest of combat. The Prince
circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: These fighting men are the very model of
patience… merely awaiting word from their lawful commander.</p>
<p><strong>as</strong>: From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold
segments. he fits them together…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You have the remaining piece, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: We do not -</p>
<p>****: Then you are most foolish. He gestures to some troll GUARDS
near a tunnel entrance. They lead the Princess out in chains.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You came here expecting what? Mercy?</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: The death you would unleash will never
happen! What you need is far from here and will stay out of your reach
forever.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 106</strong>: A VOICE reaches their ears from the
tunnel entrance behind them.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Stop - I have it. Abe, dripping wet, stands
there, the last gold segment in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>****: Here… For her… Take it…</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Oh, my God. What has he done? Keeping his
eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece to the Prince. Hellboy
steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Abe -</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: You cannot fight him- not without hurting
her…</p>
<p>****: What would you do if it was Liz?? CLICK! The Prince fits the
gold parts together and places the resulting crown on his head!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I am Prince Nuada and I command my army to
life once more. Does anyone dispute my right? With the deep sound of
gears, ratchets and springs, the army comes to life. Up comes the lances
and shields.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Kill them. Abe is now aghast, seeing the
Prince drag his sister back.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: That was your price!! A ransom, you said - paid
in good faith!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 107</strong>: ABE Why, he lied to us!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we need
to talk. The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: He - he’s a cad! Can you imagine, a highborn
heir to the throne, last in a noble line of-</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Not now, Abe, okay? The first phalanx of
golden soldiers is upon them, their terrifying weapons slashing in
unison. Hellboy brings out his huge gun and starts firing as Johann
grabs a torch and swings it like a club. A couple of the mechanical
soldiers go down, only to pop back onto their feet, new weapons
blossoming on their arms.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Let me - Liz summons up a white-hot burst of
electrical fire in each hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing
EXPLOSION at the oncoming fighters. The shock wave rolls through the
enemy ranks, flattening scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team
regains hope… but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming, marching
on and over their scorched comrades. Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and
rushes forward, giving it his best. His wound is running with fresh
blood. He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against his
ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy groans and keeps
fighting, to absolutely no effect. At length, the mechanical arms throw
Hellboy against the wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Invincibility!? So - the only one thing may
stop them - Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 108</strong>: Instantly, the thing whirls on its
companions and starts chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly
about as Johann rips into the enemy!! But again, fresh metal soldiers
fill in for the fallen. As the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann’s
mechanical shell is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
dismember it like marauding insects! As the parts drop to the floor,
twitching and useless, Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Ach. They are too many. Anyone have another
idea? Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
command this army! With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a
halt! All the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
ledge with his sister.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: No= please- no- Hellboy moves away from
him.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: A challenge must be answered! Raise your
sword!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are no
one.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the Fallen
one- He has the right! Her eyes lock with Abe’s: there’s no other way.
The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks up his
sword.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Very well. May his fate show you the cost of
pride and blindness. As the hall rings with their first blows of their
swords-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Hellboy’s too weak- Summoning up his last
ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to drive the Prince back into the
center of the arena, where they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the
golden army. Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep parrying off
his enemy. Hellboy’s sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond. The Prince is
ready to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No!! NO! ! A sudden movement at the ledge,
where the Princess steps forward and… Using her concealed DAGGER, she
STABS HERSELF in the right arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the
dagger. Instantly, the Prince drops his arm… his hands come away red
with blood. He looks over at his sister. They share a hard look of
mutual understanding. Love and hatred. Hellboy raises, through supreme
effort, bleeding. He quickly raises his sword. The fight resumes, but
this time, HB has the advantage. He fights bravely and after parrying
fiercely with the Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his
chest.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I- have- won-</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No. You have not-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 110</strong>: He impales himself on HELLBOY’s
sword. The blade goes through his abdomen and protrudes on the other
side. Hellboy pulls it out, but it’s too late. Both the Prince and the
Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.</p>
<p><strong>no-</strong>: Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his
arms, blinking in despair. The pale young creature is now a ghostly
white. She lifts her eyes to Abe’s, caressing his thin, scaly face.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: We’ll find each other again, somewhere.
And she dies in his arms. In the center of the arena:</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You… think you’re any different from me? The
humans - they will tire of you. They will disappoint you. And in the
end, they will betray you. You… are living a lie. Your time will come
again. May you make a better choice. Then, he, too, is dead. Both him
and his sister turn to fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the
ashes from Abe’s hands… Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the
Prince’s head. Looks at it carefully, as if considering the
possibilities. Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
segement… . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a heap
of scrap metal! Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown
and another massive division of the army tumbles into junk! HB is about
the tear up the last segment of the crown, when it explodes in his
hands! WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates. Hellboy confronts the
Prince’s frightened troll guards:</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
in the shadows - where you belong. As the ogres slink back into the
tunnels, Liz looks at Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince’s
last words.</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Any last minute requests?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Do it, please. I - I’m ready for the real world
now. Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch… and the
BPRD team walks through.</p>
<p>****: Whoa! Where’d you come from? We were just-</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
that Manning.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy 2 112</strong>: Abe steps past Hellboy and removes
his gunbelt and equipment pack.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you, too. For
all you’ve done for us over the years. He gives his stuff to the
astonished agent.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: What? What, exactly is this?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I quit. Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out
the Samaritan and shrugs off his pack, too.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Come on. You’re resigning?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Looks that way, doesn’t it? Hellboy starts
to leave, but spins around and takes his gun back.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I think I’ll keep this. He finally meets
Liz’s gaze. She crosses to him and takes him by the arm. She walks off
with Hellboy and Abe, clinging tightly to the big, red daemon.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Liz – not you, too!? They can’t do this.
Stop them, Johann-</p>
<p><strong>johann</strong>: Manning, you’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What you said before - about us living</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I mean it! `Course, I’m thinking USA… but,
hey - you decide.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Let’s find a place in the country. Clean air -
green hills - fresh milk from the farm.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Milk? Yech.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: A yard… With lots of room to grow in.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Grow? who gonna grow- ?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Our baby, that’s who!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Our b-? On Hellboy’s immense grin: FREEZE
FRAME. Roll CREDITS. At the end of the credits-</p>
