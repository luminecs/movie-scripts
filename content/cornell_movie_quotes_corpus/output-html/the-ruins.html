<h1 id="the-ruins">the-ruins</h1>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We should play War. It’s more fun. Jeff takes
a card from his hand, lays it down on the table.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s not even a game.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Sure it is. I’ll teach you. She starts-to
fold her hand,’but Jeff shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know how to play. I mean it’s just
chance–there’s no skill involved.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: But I keep losing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: ’Cause you’re not concentrating.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I wouldn’t have to concentrate if we played
War.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Exactly. So where’s the fun?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’d win sometimes. It’s not fun if we both
can’t win.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But it’s not winning if it’s just chance.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Of course it is. If we flipped a coin, and I
called heads, and it–</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fuck..;this.. shit.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Maybe you should just be honest, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why would they hire you if you haven’t read the
books?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I said I had.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So maybe you should..</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The Canterbury Tales? You ever look at that
shit?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ve read it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fuck off. It’s not even English. Jeff watches
Stacy take another card; she examines it, sets it on the discard pile.
Then, RECITING:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo, and
we been pilgrymes, passing to and fro. Deeth is an ende of every worldly
soore.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m fine. I’ve got a base.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’re burning. I can see it. She finally
opens her eyes, lifts her head, peers at her shoulders. She presses at
the pink skin.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: I’m just flushed. It’s too hot. Stacy leans
forward, picks a second card off the deck. Jeff is focused on Amy; he
doesn’t notice.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’re hot because you’re burning.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s only been– Stacy interrupts, speaking in a
slightly SINGSONG fashion:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So there was this king, who lived in a
castle. Amy turns, gives her a pained look.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But what he really wanted was a beach
house.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stop it. Both of you. Right now. They ignore
her, ping-ponging quickly back and forth:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So he decided to move.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But the Queen didn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So he left by himself.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But he got lonely. Amy covers her ears with
her hands, blocking out their voices, but then inmiediately reaches to
feel for her earrings: one of them is missing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So he bought a dog.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But it had fleas.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I lost my earring.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So he gave it a bath.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But the dog caught. cold. Amy sits up,
glancing about. Stacy and Eric keep going:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So he gave it some medicine.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But it was the wrong kind.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So the dog died. Amy rises, steps toward the
pool. Jeff lays down his cards, joins her beside the water. They both
peer into it.</p>
<p><strong>mathias’s pov - the pool</strong>: Eric and Stacy have risen
to join Jeff and Amy; they’re all peering into the water. Amy holds her
remaining earring out to Eric and Stacy, showing them what it looks
like.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene - mathias</strong>: He stands there,
hesitating. Then he starts forward.</p>
<p><strong>mathias’s pov - through the mask - underwater - day</strong>:
We glide just above the pool’s pale blue bottom. A silver earring comes
into view. Mathias’s hand reaches for it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thank you so much. .Mathias nods. He starts to
turn, as if to swim off, but Jeff stops him:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait. . .want a beer? He waves toward their
chairs, the cooler beside them.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We went sailing yesterday. Out toward Cozumel?
And there were these seven foot fish, these huge–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nurse sharks.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Like thirty of them. A whole, you know,
flock.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: School.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The water was, I don’t know, ten feet deep?
And they were lying on the bottom, just waiting for somebody to come
swimming by–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They’re not dangerous. Eric turns, stares at
Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You said they’re sharks.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But they’re not dangerous. They eat lobsters.
Sea urchins. That sort of thing. Eric considers this, frowning. Then he
takes a sip of beer. He shrugs, turns back toward Mathias.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I wouldn’t be snorkeling on my own.’ That’s
all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: I wasn’t on my own. I was with my brother.
Jeff glances around the pool.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s here? Mathias shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: He met a girl. They went away.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: To?</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: It’s a complicated story. They watch him,
waiting for more, but nothing comes. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You should hang with us, then. If you’re on
your own. Right? Everyone nods, smiling. Eric reaches into the cooler,
pulls out another beer, holds it toward Mathias.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Dance. Eric smiles, as if the idea of Jeff
dancing were absurd.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Jeff doesn’t dance, Amy–he has no rhythm. Of
all his many gifts, rhythm is not one.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s not true. He played the trombone in high
school. He won a prize. Eric seems startled by this, amused.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Seriously? Amy nods. She drains her beer,
tosses the cup aside.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff’s won prizes for everything. His Mom has a
whole room built just for them. Trophies and ribbons and plaques. He’s a
very accomplished young man.</p>
<p>****: You?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t dance on sand. Stacy makes a SNORTING
sound.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Or grass. Or cement. Or carpet.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I dance on teak.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Teak?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s a type of wood. Very rare. Find me a teak
floor and I’ll be a dancing fool. Amy shifts toward Mathias, holds out
her hand. He stares at it, then glances at Jeff. Before he can speak,
Stacy pushes herself to her feet; she’s almost as wobbly as Amy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’ll dance.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m gonna head back. Eric gives him a look of
disappointment,</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re kidding. Jeff seems STARTLED by
this:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How long is med school? Four years? Jeff nods.
ERIC And then you got, whaddya call it, residency? Another nod. Eric
turns toward Mathias. ERIC He’s gonna be grinding away all that time.
Sleepless. Fucking miserable. And know what? He’s gonna look back on
this night, us right here, and he’s gonna say to himself, shit, I wish
I’d–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Gone to bed earlier. Eric stares at him; this
wasn’t the direction he was heading. JEFF If I’m gonna be so short on
sleep, I should get as.much as I can now, don’t you think? He stands up,
brushes the sand from his shorts. Eric shrugs, lifts his cup toward
him.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: All work and no play–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. With
that, Jeff nods good night to them, then starts off toward the hotel.
Eric and Mathias turn back toward the bonfire. They sit in silence,
watching the girls dance. After a moment, Amy staggers away from the
other dancers, toward a group of young men, drinking together in the
shadows. She reaches down, pulls one of them to his feet, starts to drag
him back toward the bonfire. The young man is tall, with long blond
hair. He LAUGHS, tries to free himself, but Amy is insistent; she keeps
pulling at him, and finally he surrenders. They begin to dance. Stacy is
dancing on her own, eyes shut, oblivious. Mathias glances toward Eric.
Eric shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Amy drifts sometimes, when she drinks.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Drifts?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Like a boat–she bumps into other boats. They
continue to watch. Amy and her partner’s dancing is becoming steadily
more intimate, the gap between their bodies narrowing, then disappearing
altogether. Finally, Eric pushes himself to his feet.’ ERIC Come on.
Let’s save everyone some grief. He starts. forward, followed by Mathias.
They join Stacy and Amy, and Eric subtly interrupts Amy’s pas de deux.
The blond- haired young man disengages, drifts back toward his
friends.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’re up early. Mathias lifts his head: Jeff
is standing there in his sweaty shirt, smiling down at him.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: I have to catch a bus.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: To? Mathias slides the sheet of paper toward
him. Jeff bends to look. There’s a paragraph in German scrawled above a
hand- drawn map, with four place names: Cancun, Valladolid, Tizimin,
Coba. A large X has been drawn to the west of Coba.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: The girl my brother met was on her way to
this place, to work. It’s a dig–an archaeological dig. And he went with
her. He left the map, saying I could come, too, if I got bored on my
own. A beat; he watches Jeff examine the map. Then: MATHIAS Our flight
leaves the day after tomorrow. I can wait and hope he returns in time..
Or I can go get him. It’s a question of trusting him to do the right
thing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Henrich doesn’t think things through. He
runs at them. He’s…</p>
<p>****: There’s a word in English, but I can’t remember it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: impetuous?</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: So I have to be–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Responsible.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: All our lives, the same story. Jeff.slides
the map back toward him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s what? One of those pyramids?</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: An old mining camp.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: De oro? 0 plata? Mathias just stares at him.
JEFF You don’t speak Spanish? Mathias shakes his head. JEFF So how will
you find this place?</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Follow the m ap. Jeff frowns down at the
map for a long beat. It seems as if he’s going to question the
feasibility of this, but. then he disengages instead, wiping at the
sweat on his face.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, good luck.</p>
<p><strong>jeff’s pov - through the window</strong>: The waiter refills
Mathias’s glass. Mathias smiles, nods.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jeff hesitates, wavering. Then he
pushes open the door again, steps outside. We watch–</p>
<p><strong>through the window</strong>: –as he approaches Mathias.
There’s the sound of someone RETCHING, COUGHING. This carries over
into:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You okay? Amy doesn’t answer. She COUGHS,
spits. JEFF You don’t have to come, you know.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t look fine.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thank you. That’s very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll be back by nightfall. You can just– Amy
is raising the brush to her mouth, but she stops, gives Jeff a look in
the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You don’t want me to come?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s not what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So what’re you saying?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’re hungover, under slept,</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m not sunburned. Jeff stares at her, the deep
red of her face. Then he shrugs, steps out of the tub, the towel around
his waist.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: .All right. My mistake. Amy bends over the
sink, starts to brush her teeth.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Pants. Amy stops, the shorts around her
ankles.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ll get too sweaty.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s gonna be mosquitoes. He picks up a
knapsack, steps to the mini-fridge, opens its door. Amy stares down at
the khakis for a beat, then drops back onto the bed. She lies there,
looking up at the ceiling, her shorts still caught around her
ankles.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We don’t even know this guy. Jeff slides two
bottles of iced tea into the knapsack. There’s a plastic shopping bag
beside the fridge, and he starts to dig through it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I just don’t see why we have to go with
him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: If you and I were traveling together,
somewhere you didn’t speak the language, and I’d vanished somehow,
wouldn’t you want someone to help find me?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why would you vanish? Jeff turns, looks at her:
this isn’t the point.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Aren’t you getting bored? Honestly. The beach,
the pool, the beach, the pool. This’ll be fun. An adventure. Jeff pulls
two protein bars from the bag, a box of raisins, a plastic bag full of
grapes; he drops them into the knapsack. JEFF You said you wanted to
go;hiking, didn’t you? See the ruins. Amy is silent, unmoving, clearly
not swayed.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why do you keep saying that?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s like you’d rather I didn’t– A KNOCKING at
the door, and she falls silent. Jeff rises, zipping shut the knapsack.
He steps to the door, opens it. Stacy and Eric are in the hall.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ready? The both answer at the same time:</p>
<p><strong>jeff amy</strong>: Amy’s having second thoughts. Jeff doesn’t
want me to go. Stacy and Eric are silent; neither wants to get involved
in this. A beat, then Jeff SIGHS, glances at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now or never, Any. .We’re gonna miss the bus.
Amy gives a loud GROAN, sits up, reaches for her khakis.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Now what? Mathias has his brother’s note. He
holds it out, pointing, and they gather around him to look.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: We take a cab. To here. WE SEE the map:
there’s a line drawn from Cancun to Coba, where another, shorter line
moves westward. Mathias’s finger moves along this shorter line, toward
the X on the map.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Eighteen kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: How many miles is that? They all glance at
Jeff. He shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Eleven. A little more.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Then there’ll be a path. Which we hike–four
kilometers. The others look to Jeff again. He slings his pack.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Two and a half miles.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: I don’t see any cabs. The bus eases into
motion, CRUNCHING across the gravel, pulling out onto the road. Behind
it, a yellow pickup truck is revealed. “TAXI” is hand-painted in black
on its side. They start toward the truck. Its DRIVER is Mayan: short and
heavy-set, with thick glasses. His eyes are shut; he’s dozing behind the
wheel. The truck’s engine.is running, the windows shut tight against the
heat. Jeff TAPS the window, and there’s a burst of movement from the
truck’s rear, as a dog springs up, BARKING and GROWLING. They all leap
back, the girls SHRIEKING. The dog is a mutt–small, but muscular. He’s
attached to a cinder block by a short chain, which he throws himself
against, slobbering, snapping at the air. They all stare at the dog; the
girls LAUGH nervously, clutching each other. The driver has roused
himself; he leans forward, rolls down his window, stares out at
them.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hola. The man gives him a somber nod; the dog
keeps BARKING. Jeff takes the map from Mathias, then steps warily
forward. JEFF Habla ingles usted? The man half-nods, half-shrugs. JEFF
How much to drive us to here? He offers the map to the driver, who
reaches to take it. The man frowns at it. Then, in HEAVILY ACCENTED
ENGLISH:</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Why you go this place? Jeff struggles for a
simple way to explain their mission. in the back of the truck, the dog
continues its frantic BARRING.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There are these ruins. This old mining
camp?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Fifteen dollar, I take you ruins.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: To here? Jeff points at the map. The driver
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This place no good. He holds the map back
out toward Jeff. Jeff takes it, gives the man a puzzled look.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No good?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: No good you go. Fifteen dollar I take you
good place. You like, I promise. Jeff glances toward the others, as if
for help. They all just stand there, watching. The dog won’t stop
BARRING. DRIVER I take you pyramid. Huy grande. Everyone happy. He
smiles at Jeff; his teeth are large and thick-looking,. and black along
the gums. Jeff pulls out his wallet. He removes a ten and a five, then
points at the map.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How about we pay you fifteen dollars to go
here? He holds the money out. The man doesn’t even look at it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I tell you no good. Still you go? His smile
has disappeared; he seems angry suddenly, as if Jeff has somehow
insulted him. Jeff hesitates, glancing toward the others again. Then, in
a CONCILIATORY TONE:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’re looking for his brother. Su hermano?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: El dinero. Jeff gives him the money. Then
the driver SLAPS the side of the truck, gestures for them to climb into
the back.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Gracias, senor! The driver doesn’t even look
at him; he just pulls out onto the road, heading back in the direction
from which they came. There are mosquitoes; Stacy starts to slap at
herself. Jeff unslings his pack, pulls out a can of insect repellent.
JEFF Here. He begins to spray her, then Eric. Amy is peering off after
the truck. They can still hear the dog’s BARKING, but very faintly now.
Jeff finishes with Eric, starts in on Mathias.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How do we get back? She points back down the
road, toward the vanished truck. Jeff pauses in his spraying, considers
for a moment. Then:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The guidebook said you can always flag down a
passing bus. So I–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There aren’t going to be any buses on that
road. Jeff nods; this seems obvious. He resumes spraying Mathias. Eric
and Stacy stand there, watching. AMY A bus couldn’t even fit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It also said you can hitch–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: See any cars pass, Jeff? Jeff doesn’t answer.
He steps toward her, starts to spray her, too. She holds out her arms.
AMY The whole time we were driving, you see even one?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Eric has his phone. Can’t we just call
someone?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He’s not gonna get a signal. Not way out here.
They all turn to watch as Eric reaches into. his pack, pulls out his
cell phone, flips it open. He stares at it for a beat, then shakes his
head, snaps it shut. Jeff finishes spraying Amy, starts in on
himself.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They must-have a way to get supplies in.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The archaeologists. They must have a truck. Or
access to a truck. When we find Mathias’s brother, we can just ask them
to take us all back to Coba. Right? Mathias seems startled by the
question.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: I guess …I mean, I– He shrugs; he has no
idea. Amy is still focused on Jeff:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We’re stranded, aren’t we? That’s, like, a
twenty mile walk we’re gonna have to do. Through the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What? Jeff finishes with the insect repellent,
crouches to slide the can back into his pack.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s eleven miles.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There’s no way that was eleven miles.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Let’s just find this place, okay? Then we can
figure out how to get back. Amy is silent. Jeff turns to the others.
JEFF Ready? Mathias and Eric nod, and the boys start down the path. Amy
stands there, watching them go. Stacy steps toward her.’</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Just go with it, honey. You’ll see–it’ll all
work out. She hooks arms with her, pulls her into motion.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So-there was this girl who bought a piano.
Amy gives a loud MOAN.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But she didn’t know how to play.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So she signed up for lessons.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But she couldn’t afford them. Stacy reaches,
taps Mathias’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You can play, too. If you want.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But was fired for being late. Amy takes off
her hat, wipes the sweat from her face.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s annoying.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So she became a prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s tedious and boring. And once they start,
it’s impossible to get them to stop.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But she fell in love with her first client.
Amy puts her hat back on. She looks hot, sweaty, tired.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How much farther? Mathias peers down at his
brother’s note. Stacy and Eric continue with their game.</p>
<p><strong>mathias stacy</strong>: We cross a stream. Then So she asked
him to marry there’ll be a path, branching her. off to our left. If we
see a village, we’ve gone too far. AMY ERIC A village? But he was
already married.</p>
<p><strong>mathias stacy</strong>: A Mayan village. So she begged him to
get a divorce. AMY ERIC Will they have air But he was in love with his
conditioning? wife.</p>
<p><strong>mathias stacy</strong>: It just says there’s a So she decided
to kill her. village. AMY I think we should go see it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I think we should— Jeff stops suddenly,
pointing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The stream. Thirty feet in front of them, the
trail dips toward a small stream, studded with boulders. It resumes on
the far bank, rising gradually uphill in a long straightaway. The stream
is slow moving, the water dark brown. Eric SNIFFS the air.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fucking smells.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They must use it as a latrine.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The village. The Mayans. They start toward it,
gingerly, the girls covering their noses. Jeff crosses the stream,
hopping from boulder to boulder, and the others follow. Stacy almost
falls in; she only catches her balance at the final instant, YELPING.
Jeff is already starting up the trail, searching for the turnoff.
There’s no sign of it; the dense foliage extends unbroken as far as the
eye can see. He turns to Mathias. JEFF How far past the stream?.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Right after, it says.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look. Up the trail, sixty feet away, stand two
small Mayan boys; they seem to have materialized out of the air. They’re
ten years old, shirtless, scrawny, dark-haired. one of them is holding a
bicycle by its handlebars; it doesn’t have a seat. AMY Maybe they can
guide us. Stacy smiles toward the boys; she waves, CALLS OUT:</p>
<p><strong>holal</strong>: The boys just stand there, staring at them,
silent, their expressions wary, even frightened. One of them leans to
whisper something to the other, who nods.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Why don’t we– He stops, noticing Mathias. The
German is staring toward the edge of the trail, where a large bush sits.
one of its fronds is very slowly dropping toward them, pulling itself
free of the soil. Mathias steps forward, tugs at a second frond, which
slips easily from the dirt. He tosses it aside, reaches for another
frond: this, too, slips free. Someone has pushed them into the earth,
arranging them to look like a bush. Mathias pulls a fourth frond free,
then a fifth, and an opening is revealed in the brush, a narrow path
winding its way off through the trees. They stand there a beat, staring
at it. Then there’s a SQUEAKING SOUND, and they all turn.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - up the trail</strong>: one of the boys is
hurriedly pedaling off, bent low over the bicycle’s handlebars. His
companion remains behind, staring toward us with a look of obvious
anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Amy turns to Jeff; so do the
others.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why was it covered? Jeff lifts his hands: how
should he know?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Maybe it’s not the right path. NO one speaks.
They keep staring from the boy to the newly revealed path, trying to
make sense of it. WE can still HEAR the squeaking of the bicycle,
growing steadily fainter.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s on the map.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s a hand-drawn map, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: And it was hidden. Why would it be hidden?
Jeff steps forward, shields his eyes, tries to peer into the dimness of
the narrow path. Then he glances back toward the little boy, who
continues to stand there, watching them.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Maybe the archaeologists don’t want people to
find the mine.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Because? Jeff has to think. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Maybe they’ve dug up something valuable.
Emeralds or something. Or silver. Whatever they were mining in the first
place. And they don’t want anyone to come rob them. So they’ve asked the
Mayans to help keep people away. He falls into silence, staring at the
boy. No one appears very convinced by his theory, not even Jeff. He
shrugs. JEFF How much farther is it? Mathias takes the map from his
pocket again, glances at it.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Not far.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Be silly to stop now, don’t you think? No one
answers; no one moves.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: This just feels weird, Jeff. Jeff SIGHS,
fighting to suppress his impatience with her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So we what? Turn around? Walk all the way back
to Coba? Silence. They all turn to stare back down the trail, then
toward the Mayan boy, who’s still watching them. Stacy SLAPS a mosquito,
leaving a bloody smear on her bare arm. Jeff lifts his hand, gestures at
the path.leading into the trees. JEFF Come on. We’re almost there. The
others glance at one another, waiting for someone to argue; no one does.
Finally, Mathias steps forward, slipping through the narrow opening.
Eric follows him, and then, with just the slightest hesitation, so do
Amy and Stacy. Jeff throws one last glance toward the boy–who’s still
standing there, sixty feet away, watching with his anxious
expression–and then he, too, vanishes into the trees.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Maybe the ruins are sacred. You know? And they
don’t want people digging them up. He glances about, off into the trees,
a little spooked. ERIC We could be walking through some sort of ancient
graveyard right now. And they’ve–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s a mine. An old mining camp.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s nothing sacred about it. Eric
considers this as they walk. The others are also quiet: too hot to
speak. The sunlight falls through the trees in thin, shifting columns,
hazed with mosquitoes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Maybe it leads to a marijuana field, then.
Maybe the village is growing pot, and that boy rode off to get them, and
they’re gonna come with guns and–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Eric.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shut up, okay? Eric falls silent. They follow
the path as it curves first right, then left, moving gradually uphill
all the while, and suddenly there’s sunlight in front of them, bright
and intense: a clearing. They hesitate at its edge, staring.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: And the mosquitoes are gone. You realize
that? They’ve stopped biting. She smiles at the others, delighted by
this development. Amy removes the cap from her camera, starts to take
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - through the viewfinder</strong>: WE HEAR a click
as she takes each photo, and the image freezes for an instant. There’s
the hillside, covered in its vine, its red flowers: CLICK. There’s Eric
pulling the water bottle from his pack: CLICK. There’s Stacy smiling at
us, waving: CLICK. There’s Mathias shading his eyes, peering up the
hill.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Smile, Mathias.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Is that a tent? He points.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Amy lowers her camera, turns to
look.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - up the hill</strong>: An orange square of fabric
is just visible, at the very top of the hill, billowing, sail-like, in
the breeze. From this distance, with the rise of the hill partly
blocking the view, its hard to tell what it is.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: They all stand there, peering up the
hill. Faintly, but growing steadily louder, a THUDDING noise comes from
the jungle. The five of them turn, heads cocked, listening.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: A horse. It’s true: HOOFBEATS are approaching
at a gallop. Instinctively, Jeff and the others back a handful of steps
toward the hill. A long. beat, then a horseman bursts into the clearing,
rearing to a halt. Amy lifts her camera.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - through the viewfinder</strong>: A bald Mayan man
is on the horse; he’s broad-shouldered, short, in his early forties,
dressed in a white shirt and pants. The horse rears a second time, and
the image FREEZES for an instant, with a CLICK, as Amy snaps another
picture.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The bald man SHOUTS at them in
UNSUBTITLED MAYAN. His horse is lathered, SNORTING, rolling its eyes. It
rears yet again, and the man half-falls, half-jumps to-the ground. Jeff
and the others back a few more steps into the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - through the viewfinder</strong>: The bald man is
still holding the reins; the horse is backing away from him, jerking its
head, trying to break free, pulling him, step-by-step, back toward the
trail. CLICK.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The man can’t gain control of the
horse. Finally, he drops the reins, and the horse gallops into the
jungle, CRASHING through the trees, its hoofbeats gradually diminishing.
The man turns toward them, starts YELLING in MAYAN again, pointing back
down the trail. Sweat shines on his forehead. There’s a gun on his belt,
a black pistol in a brown holster. Stacy is clutching Eric’s arm,
looking frightened.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Maybe he wants money? A toll or something? The
Mayan continues SHOUTING, waving his arm. Jeff reaches into his pocket,
pulls out his wallet, removes a twenty.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Dinero? The man ignores the proffered bill,
makes a shooing motion, waving them from the clearing. Mathias turns
toward the hill, cups his hands around his mouth, SHOUTS:</p>
<p><strong>henrichi</strong>: There’s no response, just the orange
fabric gently billowing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why don’t you hike up, see if you can find
him? We’ll try to sort this out. Mathias nods, starts across the
clearing. The bald man SHOUTS at him in Mayan, and then, when Mathias
doesn’t stop, pulls his pistol from its holster, FIRES into the sky.
Everyone flinches, half-ducking. Stacy SCREAMS. Mathias goes still. The
man waves at him, YELLING in Mayan, and Mathias comes back, his hands
raised, to join the others. HOOFBEATS are approaching from the jungle
again. They come closer and closer, and suddenly two more horsemen burst
into the clearing. They’re younger than the bald mans in their twenties,
dark-haired, muscular. One has a mustache. Their mounts are white-eyed,
SNORTING, rearing, just like the bald man’s. The two men jump to the
ground, dropping their reins, and the horses immediately turn and gallop
back into the jungle. Amy lifts her camera again.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - through the viewfinder</strong>: The young men
have bows slung across their chest, and quivers of thin, fragile-looking
arrows. They question the bald man in MAYAN, very rapidly. He’s still
aiming his pistol at Mathias. A CLICK, and the image freezes for an
instant.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: As they continue to interrogate the
bald man in MAYAN, the young men unsling their bows, each of them
nocking an arrow. Reflexively, Jeff and the others retreat another
handful of steps into the clearing. Mathias still has his hands
raised.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait. Wait and see. Amy is a bit farther into
the clearing than Jeff and the others. She keeps swinging her camera
from them to the Mayans, trying to capture the whole scene in one shot.
She’s too close, though,-and she retreats another handful of steps.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - through the viewfinder</strong>: Still backing up
toward the hill; all of them but Stacy and Eric are in the frame now.
The bald Mayan is still answering the young men’s questions. He turns
toward us suddenly, points his pistol directly at us,.starts to
SHOUT.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jeff and the others turn, too,
staring at Amy in surprise. She’s nearly at the far edge of the
clearing, peering through her camera; she retreats another step. The
young Mayans raise their bows, drawing them; the bald man keeps
YELLING.</p>
<p><strong>amy–</strong>: She takes another step; she’s right up against
the vines.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - through the viewfinder</strong>: Stacy is in the
frame now. We retreat one more step, and so is Eric, and the Mayans with
their raised weapons, the bald man still SHOUTING: everything FREEZES on
the CLICK.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Amy lowers her camera. The Mayan with
the mustache turns to the other two, points toward her feet, SPEARING
URGENTLY. The bald Mayan slowly lowers his pistol, looking dismayed. Amy
glances down.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - her feet</strong>: She’s stepped out of the
clearing, into the flowering vine.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Both of the younger Mayans are
speaking now, their voices RISING. The bald Mayan is shaking his head,
protesting, but they talk right over him. Amy steps clear of the vine,
starts back toward Jeff, and the younger Mayans draw their bows taut
again, aiming at her chest. She freezes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff—</strong>: Jeff lifts his hand, without looking, his
eyes on the Mayans.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t move. The bald man continues to frown
and shake his head. He points to Amy, then the others; he waves toward
the jungle. But the young men are implacable–they keep arguing,
gesturing–and finally the bald man gives in, falls SILENT. A beat, then
the bald man raises his pistol, aims it at Jeff’s chest. He makes a
shooing motion with his other hand, but now it’s toward Amy, and the
hill beyond her. He begins to SHOUT; the other men do, too. Then the
bald man FIRES a bullet into the dirt at Jeff’s feet. Everyone jumps,
starts to retreat. The men with the bows are swinging them back and
forth, herding them toward the hill. When Jeff and the others reach Amy,
the bald man points toward the trail, waves them up it. He watches–his
expression looking stricken, close to tears–as the five of them
obediently begin to climb the vine-covered hill.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Check your phone, Eric. Eric pulls out his
phone, flips it open, stares at it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Nothing.. He snaps it shut. They stand there:
sweating, scared looking. Mathias cups his hands to his mouth again,
SHOUTS:</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Henrich…I They all peer up the hill,
waiting for a response.</p>
<p><strong>eric’s pov – up the hill</strong>: It is a tent: bright
orange, looking a bit worse for wear. The vine is growing up its
aluminum poles as if on a trellis. .The tent faces away from us; its
doorway is hidden. There’s no sign or sound of any people.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Eric turns, glances back down the
hill, shielding his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There’s another one. He points toward the
clearing below them.</p>
<p><strong>eric’s pov the clearing</strong>: A fourth man has arrived,
on a bicycle. He’s dressed in white, like the others, with a straw hat
on his head. A beat, then two more Mayans appear, also on bicycles. They
all have bows slung over their shoulders. The bald man addresses these
newcomers. He waves in either direction, and the other men start off
along the clearing, two one way, three the other, leaving him alone at
the base of the hill. A beat, then a little boy appears from the
jungle–the one who’d watched them discover the camouflaged path. He and
the bald man stand there, peering up at us.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Eric turns to the others,
EXCITED:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Let’s run back down. Quick. While there’s just
him and the kid. We can rush them.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: He’s got a gun, Eric. This silences
Eric–silences all of them. Mathias turns, SHOUTS toward the tent
again.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Henrich…1 There’s no answer. They wait
another beat, then Jeff waves them back into motion.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello…? SILENCE. The vine covers everything
but the trail and the clearing. We glimpse more rubble beneath its
greenery: time- worn stelae, a low stone wall. In some places the vine
folds back upon itself, forming waist- high mounds, tangled knoll-like
profusions of green. And everywhere, hanging off it, are those bright
red flowers. Mathias moves toward the orange tent, and Jeff follows him.
They UNZIP its flap, stoop to peer inside.</p>
<p><strong>jeff’s pov - inside-the orange tent</strong>: The vine has
taken root in here, too, growing on some things, leaving others
untouched. There are three sleeping bags unrolled on the floor. An oil
lamp. Two backpacks. A roll of duct tape. A bottle of tequila. A metal
canteen.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jeff and Mathias ZIP the flap back
shut. Eric, Stacy and Amy are fifteen feet away, watching.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What’s inside?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nothing. Some camping supplies. Mathias starts
across the clearing toward the blue tent, followed by Jeff and the
others. He UNZIPS its flap, sticks his head inside. Jeff leans to look,
too.</p>
<p><strong>jeff’s pov - inside the blue tent</strong>: The same thing:
sleeping bags, backpacks, camping supplies. The vine is growing on some
things, but not on.others.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Ten yards beyond the tent, there’s a
hole cut into the dirt. Stacy, Amy, and Eric have gathered at its edge;
Jeff and Mathias join them. The hole is rectangular–ten feet by six
feet–and very deep; we can’t see its bottom. A windlass has been
constructed beside the hole, a horizontal barrel with a hand crank
welded to its base. Rope is coiled around the barrel. From there, it
passes over a small wheel, which hangs from a sawhorse straddling the
hole’s mouth. Then it drops straight into the earth.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The mine? Jeff nods. A draft is rising from the
hole, and it lifts off Amy’s hat. She tries to catch it, but fumbles:
the hat falls away from her. They all watch it vanish into the dark.
Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, almost absentmindedly: a
nervous gesture. There’s still no signal. He closes it, turns to survey
the clearing, the empty tents.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Now what? Jeff shrugs, waves past the shaft.
The clearing ends just a few yards from them;</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Keep going, I guess. Saying this, he slings
his pack onto his shoulder. Then he starts forward, the others falling
in behind him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff’s pov - the bottom of the hill</strong>: It looks as if
the jungle has been chopped down all the way around the base of the
hill, isolating it in a ring of barren soil. One of the Mayans has made
his way along this cleared ground to the base of the trail. He’s staring
up at them.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fuck. The man slides his bow off his shoulder,
nocks an arrow. He shakes his head at them, CALLS OUT in MAYAN, waves
them away.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The five of them stand there, staring
down at the man.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What do we do? Jeff shrugs, starts forward
again.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll see. The others hesitate, and then, one
after another, resume their downward march.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So. Her skin is slick with sweat, and she’s
winded from the hike down. A third Mayan comes jogging toward them. He
stops beside the other two, draws his bow.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We should rush them. All at once.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Shut Up, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Or go make shields. If we had some shields, we
could– He falls silent as another Mayan comes running toward them. along
the clearing. This one is bearded, heavier than the others. And he’s
carrying a rifle.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: Oh my god. Jeff is staring at the little
isolated island of vines, ten feet in front of them–peering intently at
it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Let’s go back up. Jeff takes a step forward
into the clearing–slowly, warily. STACY I wanna go back. Jeff takes
another step, edging toward the mound, his eyes on the Mayans, their
raised weapons. They just watch him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff–</strong>: He ignores her, takes a third step, then a
forth, which brings him to the mound of vines. He crouches, reaches into
the tendrils, parting them. He grasps a stalk, tugs, pulls it free. WE
SEE a tennis shoe, a sock, a man’s shin.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Easy. All right? Easy and slow. We’ll stand up
and we’ll walk away. We’ll walk back up the hill. The young man’s
T-shirt is stiff with dried blood. There are. three slender arrows
impaled in his chest.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: It’s my brother.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: They killed him. Jeff nods, his hand still
on Mathias’s.shoulder; he squeezes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Shh. Not here. Up the hill, okay? Mathias is
struggling to control his breathing; the MOANS keep coming. Finally, he
manages a nod, and they both stand up. Stacy and Amy are holding hands,
looking stricken. Stacy has started to CRY. Eric has his arm around her.
The Mayans keep their weapons raised. They watch in silence as Jeff and
the others turn to start back up the hill.</p>
<p><strong>jeff’s pov - the bottom of the bill</strong>: More Mayans are
appearing from the jungle. They’re all armed. The bald man sends them
out along the clearing, some in one direction, some ’the other.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jeff and Mathias stand there,
grim-faced, watching. Mathias lifts his hands, stares at them. They’ve
turned a deep, raw- meat red, as if scarred. He flexes his fingers,
wincing.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We can sneak past once the sun…-’ sets, I bet.
You know? Just reep by them in the dark? Stacy and Amy hardly seem to
hear him; they look dazed, distraught. Eric passes the bottle to Stacy.
A beat, then: ERIC And then there’s the girl.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The girl?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The one his brother met. What happened to her?
Amy and Stacy are silent. Stacy lifts the water bottle to her lips, but
immediately lowers it, and starts to CRY again. Amy takes her hand. Eric
watches them, silent. Then: ERIC And the archaeologists. You think–
Stacy’s crying deepens toward a SOB. Amy gives Eric a look.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stop it, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Just stop, okay? Stop talking. Stacy struggles
to collect herself, breathing deep. She wipes at her face. Amy keeps
stroking her hand. Jeff and Mathias are approaching across the hilltop.
Mathias holding his burned-looking hands out in front of him. He 9 a nd
Jeff crouch beside the others.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What happened? Jeff takes the bottle from
Stacy. He pours a tiny bit of water on Mathias’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s something in the plants. The sap–it
burned his skin. Mathias rubs at his hands with his shirt, grimacing.
Amy reaches to take the water back from Jeff. She starts to lift the
bottle to her mouth, but..Teff leans forward, grabs it. JEFF Don’t. We
need to save it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But I’m thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We all are.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So let’s drink. Jeff shakes his head, capping
the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We don’t have that much. We need to ration it.
We’ll have to figure out a way to catch the rain. Everyone but Amy peers
up at the sky: it’s a perfect, cloudless blue. Amy remains focused on
Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m hungover. I’m sunburned. I lost my hat. I
need some water.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why do you get to decide? Jeff stares at her,
considering this. Then he shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fine. Let’s vote. But first you should
understand that each of us is gonna need half a gallon of water a day,
at a minimum, to survive here. That’s two and a half gallons total,
every day. And right now, until it rains, we don’t have it. Okay? Not
even one day’s worth. Now who wants to give Amy more water? A long
moment of silence. No one can meet Amy’s eyes. Finally, VERY
QUIETLY:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Maybe we should just wait, honey.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: Till? Everyone looks toward Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Another hour or so. Then we’ll all have a sip.
Okay? Amy can see that she has no choice. She gives a grudging nod, and
Jeff slides the bottle into his knapsack. JEFF We have to get organized.
Now. While we’re still fresh. We’ll have to stay out of the sun, spend
as much time as possible in the tents. We’ll have to–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Can’t we sneak away when it gets dark? Eric
said we–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They keep coming. More and more of them.
They’re all armed, and the bald one sends them out along the clearing.
They’re surrounding us. Amy, Stacy and Eric struggle to absorb this.
Finally:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Why don’t they just kill us?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s got something to do with the hill, I
think. Once you step on it, you’re not allowed off. Something like that.
They won’t step on it themselves, but now that we’re here, they won’t
let us leave. So we have to figure out a way to survive till someone
comes and finds-us.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Who? Jeff lifts one hand, palm-up, half a
shrug.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: People’ll start to worry when we don’t return
home. Right? And</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We’re not supposed to leave till Friday. Jeff
nods. AMY And they’ll have to come searching. Again, he nods. AMY So
you’re talking–what, a week?</p>
<p><strong>.jeff</strong>: Something like that. Amy looks appalled; her
voice JUMPS:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We can’t live here for a week, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: If we try to leave, they’ll shoot us. That’s
the one thing we know for certain. An electronic CHIRPING comes from the
shaft: it sounds like a cell phone ringing. Mathias turns his head,
listening. No one else notices it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But what will we eat? How will we– The RINGING
comes again, silencing her. She glances toward the shaft, not quite
believing what she’s hearing. It comes a THIRD TIME, and they all stand
up, step to the hole, peer into its darkness. The RINGING comes yet
again.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: A cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It can’t be–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s a cell phone, Amy. Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>.amy</strong>: But there’s no signal out here. Eric can’t get
a signal. Reflexively, Eric pulls out his phone, checks again: nothing.
There’s another RING.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It could be a different network. Something
local.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Way down in that hole? How could it pick it up?
Still another RING.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What else can it be?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s a lamp in the orange tent. See if you
can find some matches, too. Amy hurries off toward the orange tent,
vanishing inside. There’s a final RING, and then SILENCE again. Mathias
is knotting the rope tightly around his chest. Amy returns, carrying an
oil lamp, a box of matches. Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light
the lamp. Then he rises, turns toward Mathias, looks at him closely.
JEFF You sure? Mathias nods, takes the lamp, steps to the edge of the
hole. Jeff and Eric move to the windlass; they position themselves at
the hand crank, leaning into it, so the rope goes taut. Mathias girds
himself, steps out over the hole. He dangles there for a moment, hanging
beneath the sawhorse, the windlass GROANING on its mount. Then Jeff and
Eric begin to reverse the crank, letting the rope slowly spool out.
Stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft, peering into it, watching as
Mathias begins his descent–ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet down, and
still only darkness beneath him, with no sign of the shaft’s bottom. The
windlass CREAKS as it turns; Jeff and Eric strain against it, sweating,
muscles taut. Amy has turned from the shaft, is watching: the rope as it
slowly unspools from the barrel.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff. He turns to look, and she points at the
rope, where it comes off the windlass and angles up toward the little
wheel hanging from the sawhorse.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Pull him up ! Eric hasn’t grasped what’s
happening. He hesitates. JEFF</p>
<p><strong>nowt</strong>: Amy jumps forward to help, all three of them
pushing at the crank, getting in each other’s way, the windlass CREAKING
as it begins to turn again, slowly reclaiming the rope. Stacy remains
beside the shaft, peering anxiously into it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy’s pov - the shaft</strong>: Mathias is twenty-five feet
beneath us, just beginning to bump his way upward, swaying back and
forth. He stares up at us, CONFUSED:</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: What is it? The rope beneath the sawhorse
is being visibly eaten away, its hemp unraveling.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Stacy turns toward the others,
pointing, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>it’s–</strong>: The rope SWAPS. Jeff, Eric and Amy fall
forward, the windlass spinning wildly behind them, free’of its weight. A
long beat, then there’s a distant, hollow-sounding THUMP, followed
instantly by the POP of the lamp shattering. Stacy leans to peer into
the shaft, her hand over her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>stacy’s pov - the shaft</strong>: Darkness. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Mathias…? Her voice ECHOES back at us.
There’s no response.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jeff, Eric, and Amy join Stacy at the
edge of the shaft, all of them staring down into the darkness, looking
horrified.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Is he– There’s a GROAN from below, very faint,
almost inaudible.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s moaning. They listen for a beat, but
there’s only silence. JEFF I heard him moan. The others don’t seem so
certain; Jeff turns to the girls. JEFF One of you will have to go.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Go? Jeff nods, waving into the shaft.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Down. We’ll clear the vine off the rope. And
you can–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why can’t you? Or Eric?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We have to work the crank. You won’t be strong
enough.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can do it.</p>
<p>****: You sure? Stacy nods, but she doesn’t look sure. She’s hugging
herself; it seems as if she might start trembling. Before anyone can
speak, that GROANING comes from the shaft again, louder this time,
unmistakable. Jeff cups his hands, SHOUTS:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Mathias…? More SILENCE. Jeff turns to the
girls. JEFF See if you can find a knife. And another lamp.’ He waves
them toward the tents; then he and Eric begin to unspool the rope from
the windlass, laying it out across the clearing in long, looping
circles.</p>
<p><strong>cu - oil lamp</strong>: The SCRATCH of a match being lit:
Amy’s hand comes into frame, lifts the lamp’s glass chimney, fires the
wick.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just help him into the sling. Then we’ll pull
him up. The chimney is carefully replaced, as WE PULL BACK TO
REVEAL:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Once we get him out, we’ll drop the rope back
down and pull you up, too. Amy offers Stacy the lamp. Stacy is scared,
yet struggling not to show it. Her hands are trembling, and the lamp
rattles as she takes it. The boys are stepping toward the windlass; Eric
stops, glances back at her.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You okay? Stacy nods, but without much
conviction. Eric steps toward her, gives her a tight hug. He holds her
eyes for a moment, kisses her. Then he joins Jeff at the hand crank.
They lean against it, and the rope goes taut. Stacy steps out into the
open air over the shaft, the lamp in her right hand. With her left hand,
she lunges, grabs at the sawhorse, clings tightly to it. Jeff glances
toward her from the hand crank.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ready? She nods, but doesn’t relinquish her
grip on the sawhorse. JEFF You have to let go, Stacy. For a moment, it
doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to, but then–with a visible act of
will–she does, and they slowly. begin to let the rope out, dropping her
into the shaft.</p>
<p><strong>on stacy - in the sling</strong>: She grips the sling with
one hand, the lamp with the other. Wooden supports have been hammered
into the walls of the shaft, buttressing the dirt. The vine clings to
them, its leaves and flowers paler than on the hillside above. Stacy
begins to swing, pendulum-like, as she descends. She tries
unsuccessfully to steady herself, then glances up.</p>
<p><strong>stacy’s pov - above her</strong>: We’re steadily dropping:
thirty feet down, then forty. Amy is at the edge of the shaft, peering
in at us. She waves.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Stacy smiles up at her. She starts to
wave back, but is too scared to let go of the sling. She glances
down.</p>
<p><strong>stacy’s pov - beneath her</strong>: The light is swaying back
and forth with Stacy, and it causes the shadows beneath us to jump and
lurch. There’s still no sign of the bottom; the windlass continues to
CREAK. A beat, and then, very faintly, Mathias’s dim shape starts to
emerge: his white tennis shoes, his pale blue T-shirt. The lamp picks up
bits of broken glass around his body.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Stacy lifts the lamp, peering
downward, struggling to see more clearly, and the sling suddenly jerks
to a halt, making her SQUAWK. She looks up.</p>
<p><strong>stacy’s pov - above her</strong>: The CREAKING has stopped.
We’re swinging slowly back and forth. WE SEE Amy peering down toward us:
a long way up, almost seventy feet. A beat, then Jeff appears, too.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stacy? His voice has an ECHO to it.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene - stacy</strong>: Her face is slick with sweat;
it shines-in the lamp light.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff .</strong>: It’s the end of the rope.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m not at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can you see him? Stacy looks down again,
holding up the lamp, peering toward Mathias’s motionless body. She lifts
her head.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Is he conscious?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can’t tell. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How far are you above him? Stacy glances down
once more, trying to quess,the distance.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Fifteen feet? He’s just lying there. She
lifts her head again, peers upward.</p>
<p><strong>stacy’s pov - above her</strong>: The top of the shaft is
empty. Very faintly, WE HEAR Jeff and the others talking, just their
voices, not their words.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Jeff … ? Jeff’s head reappears.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We have to figure out a way to lengthen the
rope. We’re gonna pull you up. He pulls his head away.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene - stacy</strong>: She’s staring upward.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Wait! The rope has almost stopped its
swaying.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I want to stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You can’t. We have to–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’ll jump. Jeff glances at the others. Eric
shakes his head. Jeff CALLS down to her:.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We might not be able to make it longer. You’ll
be trapped.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What about him? We can’t just leave him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll pull you up. Then we’ll see. He starts
toward the windlass again.</p>
<p><strong>on stacy - in the sling</strong>: The rope jerks, and she
begins to rise. She kicks her legs, lifts her left arm over head,
wrenches it free of the sling, so that only her right arm remains
hooked. She switches the lamp from her right hand to her left, then
slips completely free of,the sling, the lamp fluttering out as she
drops.</p>
<p><strong>the bottom of the shaft</strong>: Almost totally dark, just a
faint fall of light from above. Mathias is a dim shape on the floor of
the shaft. Stacy lands beside him–heavily, awkwardly–the glass from his
shattered lamp CRUNCHING beneath her.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m sorry. Oh, God. I’m so sorry. She pulls
herself into a crouch, staring down at him through the dimness, his
SHRIEK fading to a steady MOANING.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stacy…? Stacy’s voice rises toward them,
sounding. very FAR AWAY:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I didn’t want him to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What happened to the lamp?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It blew out. Jeff turns from the shaft, picks
up the box of matches. He yanks off his shirt, ties the box inside it,
then steps back to the edge of the hole. He CALLS down to Stacy:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m dropping the matches. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Okay. Jeff holds the knotted bundle over the
shaft, lets it go. It falls into the darkness. A long beat, and then,
very softly, WE HEAR the thump as it lands. STACY Got it. The three of
them stare into the hole, waiting for the light.</p>
<p><strong>the bottom of the shaft</strong>: There’s the RASP of a
match, its flickering flame, then the stronger illumination of the lamp
as Stacy lights its wick. Mathias lies on his back before her, silent
now, motionless, his eyes shut. Stacy bends toward him, WHISPERS:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Mathias…? He doesn’t respond; it’s hard to
tell if he’s conscious. Stacy lifts the lamp, peers about the shaft. The
vine has taken root even at this depth, its flowers and leaves pale to
the point of translucence. Beyond Mathias, there’s an opening in the
dirt wall, another shaft cutting perpendicularly into the earth. Its
roof is supported by a stone archway, intricately carved. Stacy rises,
as if to investigate, but then winces, nearly falls. She peers down at
her right leg. A large piece of glass is imbedded there, just beneath
her knee. it’s the size of a playing card, gently concave,’dark with her
blood. She reaches and, grimacing, pulls it from her body.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We need fifteen feet. Twenty to be safe. No
one speaks. The windlass turns with that steady CREAKING, but it’s
higher-pitched now, with no weight on the rope. JEFF Come on. Think. How
can we–</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The clothes? From the backpacks? We could knot
them together?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Would they hold? Eric frowns, uncertain. Jeff
finishes with the rope, stands there, catching his breath. Stacy’s,voice
rises toward them from the shaft:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I cut my knee. Eric hurries to the shaft,
followed by Jeff and Amy. They peer over its edge, toward Stacy, so far
beneath them, in her flickering circle of lamp light.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Bad?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: My shoe’s full of blood.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Put pressure on it. Use my shirt. They all
stare down at her, waiting.</p>
<p><strong>toe bottom of the shaft</strong>: Stacy is crouched beside
Mathias, pressing Jeff’s T-shirt to her wound. Her khakis and tennis
shoe are dark with blood; there’s a lot of it. She isn’t watching
Mathias; he startles her when he opens his eyes and speaks:</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: My…legs… His voice is faint and RASPY; we
can hear his pain in it. Stacy leans toward him, tries to smile
reassuringly.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Can’t… move …my…legs… Stacy turns to look:
his legs are lying at an odd angle, as if he were a doll that had been
carelessly tossed there.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What about the tents? We could take one down,
cut the nylon into strips. Eric and Amy glance toward the tents,
debating.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Would it be strong enough?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: we can braid them–three strips for each
section. Then knot the sections together, for strength. Before either of
them can respond, Stacy’s voice emerges from the shaft, sounding
SCARED:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I think he broke his back. They fall silent,
staring down at her. STACY He can’t move his legs. And it smells.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Smells?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Like he lost his bowels. His bladder.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh no. Please no. Jeff turns to her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How can we make a backboard? Amy starts to
shake her head, looking horrified.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, Jeff. No way. We can’t move him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: One of the frames from the backpacks? And the
tent poles. There’s tape in the orange tent. He doesn’t wait for a
response; he leans over the shaft,</p>
<p><strong>shouts:</strong>: JEFF We have to builda backboard, Stacy. It
might take a while.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Okay. Amy is shaking her head, growing
FRANTIC:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We’ll make it worse. Well jostle him, and
he’ll– Jeff turns toward her, with a hint of EXASPERATION:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We can’t just leave him down there. You know
that, don’t you? She starts to back away, toward the edge of the
clearing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: we have to tell them.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The Mayans. We have to tell them what’s
happened. Jeff gives her an incredulous look. She keeps retreating;
she’s almost at the path. AMY They can send for help.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They’re not gonna—</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We have to may. We have to– She spins, starts
off at a run, vanishing down the trail. Jeff calls after her,
SHOUTING:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy! But she’s gone. Jeff turns to Eric. JEFF
Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>the mayans’ pov - up the hill</strong>: Amy is sprinting
toward us down the trail. Jeff is ten yards behind her, also
running.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The three Mayans nock arrows. Two
other men step forward to join them. One has a bow; the other is the
bald Mayan, with the pistol. He unholsters it, and–as Amy reaches the
bottom of the trail–raises it, aiming at her chest. Amy stops just short
of the clearing: sweating, breathless, scared-looking. She lifts her
hands, palms-up, beseeching.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Help us. Please. Someone’s been hurt. He– Jeff
comes to a halt, five feet behind her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They can’t understand you. She turns, her
voice quickened with PANIC:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Say it in Spanish. Tell them he–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They don’t speak Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Try it. You have to try.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They killed Henrich. Why would- Amy tries to
tug free, but he won’t let her. She starts to SHOUT at the Mayans:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Help usi We need help! The Mayans just stare at
her, their weapons raised, their faces expressionless. one of them is
much younger than the others, almost a boy. He says something in MAYAN
to the bald man, and the bald man shakes his head. Amy begins to CRY.
Jeff pulls at her elbow.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We have to get back. Amy turns toward him, her
face smeared with tears.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I didn’t want to come. I told you we shouldn’t.
I said– Jeff tightens his grip on her arm, gives her a little shake, as
if to wake her up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Listen to me. Mathias needs our help. Right
now. He–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We shouldn’t even be here. Why did you say we’d
come? You have to do something. You have to! It’s your fault. It’s all
your– Jeff shakes her again, more roughly, his voice like a slap:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: YD-q stepped onto the hill. Amy stares at him,
startled into silence. JEFF They wouldn’t have forced us up it if you
hadn’t. He holds her eyes, making sure she understands. Then: JEFF Now
let’s go, okay? He starts to pull her back toward the trail. She allows
herself to be led; she’s begun to CRY again:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I didn’t know. I just– She’s growing
increasingly upset, almost SOBBING. She tries to turn back toward the
Mayans again, but Jeff won’t let her. AMY They have to help us.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They’re not going to.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They have to. She wrenches herself free,
stumbles, falls into the vines beside the trail. Jeff reaches for her,
but she kicks away from him, grabbing at the vines, scrambling to her
feet. As she rises, she yanks up a tendril, a clot of earth hanging from
its roots. She SCREAMS, spinning toward the clearing— AMY</p>
<p><strong>why won’t you fucking help us?</strong>: –and throws the
tendril at the Mayans. They scramble backward, with surprising panic,
SHOUTING. The youngest of them is too slow: the length of vine hits him
in the leg. He stares down at the tendril in shock. The others back
hurriedly away from him. Two of them continue to point their weapons at
Amy, but the bald man and one of the other bowmen are aiming at the
young Mayan now. There’s SHOUTING from the tree line. The entire
campsite is on its feet; a woman begins to SCREAM.</p>
<p><strong>ay.</strong>: She turns, finally. She looks horrified,
stupefied; her hands are burned a deep red from the vine’s sap. Jeff
waves her up the hill. She stares at him for another beat, and then,
without a word, starts to climb the trail. Jeff hesitates, watching the
Mayans: the bloodied corpse, the raised weapons, the KEENING woman. Then
he, too, turns and hurries off up the trail.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Maybe we could use it as a weapon, you know?
Wrap it around some stones or something. And throw them, like grenades.
I mean, if they’re that scared of it– Jeff tears off a piece of tape
with his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They have guns, Eric. And bows. What do you
think they’ll do if we start throwing the vine at them? Eric is silenced
by this. He cuts another long strip of nylon, passes it to Amy. But he
can’t seem to stop himself from talking:</p>
<p><strong>eric.</strong>: So you figure it’s, what? Sacred or
something? Like, you touch it and you have to die? Amy begins to cry
suddenly–a SOB, quickly suppressed. Jeff and Eric both turn to look at
her. The vine’s sap has scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows.
She wipes her eyes, takes a deep breath, shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m okay. But she doesn’t look it. Jeff removes
his hat, holds it out. Amy just stares at it; he nods for her to take
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Come on. You’re burning. She reaches for the
hat, puts it on, then wipes at her eyes again. Jeff leans forward,
touches her. JEFF We’re gonna get through this. All right? We’ll pull
them up. And then …I don’t know–we’ll figure things out. it has to rain
at some point. And maybe we can snare some birds. Or–</p>
<p><strong>the bottom of the shaft</strong>: The oil lamp has begun to
smoke, adding a haze to the light. Stacy is beside Mathias, holding his
hand. She’s still pressing Jeff’s shirt to her wound. The RING sounds
again. Mathias turns his head, peers toward the shaft cut into the dirt
wall to his left: that’s where it’s coming from. Stacy reaches to pick
up the lamp, rises to her feet. Another RING. Jeff SHOUTS down from
above:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stacy…? Stacy ignores him; she limps around
Mathias, starts toward the opening. She hesitates at the mouth of the
shaft, lifting her lamp to see better. There’s another RING.</p>
<p><strong>-stacy’s pov – into the shaft</strong>: The lamp’s light
doesn’t penetrate very far, but WE can SEE that the vine has taken root
here with great avidity: it grows thickly on the walls, floor and roof.
There’s a steady draft coming toward us, and the plant shifts in it,
RUSTLING.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Stacy stands there, looking scared.
There’s another RING.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can you see it? Stacy lifts her head,
SHOUTS:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No. She keeps peering into the shadows, not
moving. The ringing falls SILENT. Stacy turns, hobbles back toward
Mathias, and the light shudders, dims for a moment. She squints at it:
the oil is nearly gone. She SHOUTS up to the others: STACY The lamp’s
almost out of oil.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Then blow it out.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Blow it out?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll need it when we come down. To get him on
the backboard. Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias, sets the lamp
down before her, stares at it. She clearly doesn’t want to blow it out.
Mathias watches her, silent. JEFF All right? Stacy leans forward, lifts
the lamp’s glass chimney, blows out the flame, dropping the shaft into
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>the bottom of the shaft</strong>: Mathias and Stacy are two
dim shapes in the darkness. The windlass begins its CREAKING. A long
beat, and then:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stacy?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy -</strong>: Light the lamp! Stacy shifts; once again,
there’s the RASP of a match, then the stronger illumination of the lamp
as she lights its wick. Mathias’s eyes are shut; there’s a deep
RAGGEDNESS to his breathing. Stacy looks upward.</p>
<p><strong>stacy’s pov - above her</strong>: The backboard is dropping
toward us. Above it, the light is already fading from the sky.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Stacy rises to her feet, lifting the
lamp.</p>
<p><strong>on amy - crouching on the backboard</strong>: She’s dropping
slowly down the shaft, clenching the nylon braids, her eyes tightly
shut: terrified. The backboard sways, pendulum-like, as it descends,
almost touching the vine-covered walls.</p>
<p><strong>the bottom of the shaft</strong>: When the backboard comes
within reach, Stacy grabs it, pulling it to the-right, so that it will
come to rest at Mathias’s side. But then, with three feet still to go,
it jerks to a halt, almost toppling Amy from her perch. A beat, and
Jeff’s voice comes toward them from above:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Have you reached them?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Almost. A few more feet.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How many? Amy leans, peers down at Mathias’s
broken body.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t know. Three?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: we’re out of rope. Can you still do it? Amy
looks at Stacy; neither speaks. Finally, QUIETLY:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We’ll have to send it back up, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: If he twists–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s only a few feet. /“- Once more, Amy is
silent. Stacy lifts the lamp, examining it, the diminishing pool of oil.
STACY We have to decide. The light’s not going to last. Jeff’s voice
comes toward them from above again:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy…? They both look up; the sky has grown too
dark to see him. Amy hesitates one beat more, then YELLS:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We’re gonna try itt She climbs off the
backboard, crouches beside Mathias. Stacy sets down the lamp. AMY
Mathias…? She touches his shoulder, and he opens his eyes, stares at
her. He looks haggard, ashen.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: If you lift from his feet, he’ll bend at the
waist.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: But if I lift at his hips, won’t he arch his
back? They both stare down at Mathis, imagining these two different
scenarios. Amy glances toward the lamp, its dwindling oil.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: His knees. Stacy crouches by Mathias’s knees, a
little off balance, favoring her wounded leg. Amy bends, sliding her
hands under his shoulders. Mathias GROANS, and Stacy starts to pull
away, but Amy shakes her head. AMY Quickly. On three. They count
together:</p>
<p><strong>stacy and amy</strong>: One … two.-,.three. They lift, and
Mathias immediately starts to SCREAM. His body sags at the waist; he
begins to thrash his arms. Stacy starts to set him down, but Amy shakes
her head, SHOUTS:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>the bottom of the shaft - night</strong>: Mathias has fallen
silent. He lies on the backboard, eyes clenched, sweat beading his
forehead. Stacy is trying not to cry. She watches Amy buckle the two
belts together, then drape them over Mathias’s chest, knot them tight.
Amy strips off her own belt, gestures for Stacy to do the same. She
buckles these together, too.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I have to pee. She limps toward the wall,
lowers her pants, gingerly crouches. She stares toward the other shaft
as she pees: its stone archway, the shifting shadows, the vine rustling
softly in the steady draught. Amy binds Mathias at his thighs. She
WHISPERS to him:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You okay? She waits, but he doesn’t respond.
His eyes remain shut. Stacy rises, buttoning her pants, limps back
toward Amy. She’s on the edge of tears, is working hard to fight them
off. Amy lifts her head, SHOUTS up to Jeff: AMY Pull him up!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shouldn’t we carry him into the tent first?
Jeff pulls free the first belt, shifts to the second one.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Because?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s gonna keep leaking urine.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But we can’t just leave him out in the
open.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll rig a shelter. With what’s left of the
blue tent. Jeff pulls the second belt free. Mathias’s eyes remain shut.
JEFF One of us should stay on watch while the others sleep. Two hour
shifts. He reaches for his knapsack, unzips it. He pulls out a liter
bottle of water. JEFF .Once it’s light, we’ll figure out how much water
we have, and how to ration it. Food, too. For now, I think we should
each just take a single swig. He uncaps the bottle, hands it to Amy. He
watches her drink from it. When she’s done, she passes it to Stacy. JEFF
Eric and I’ll build the shelter,. then I’ll take the first shift. You
two should try to sleep. Stacy takes her single sip, passes the bottle
to Eric.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Amy? what?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We shouldn’t have lifted him, should we? Amy
reaches, pats Stacy’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: He’s never gonna walk again.. He’s–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Don’t, Stacy. Don’t talk. It’ll only make
things worse. Stacy falls silent. AMY Just go to sleep, okay? Let’s try
to go to sleep. Stacy lies down next to Amy, in her-underwear and
T-shirt. They huddle close together in the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We have to keep him clean. He slices the
jeans, from ankle to hip, first one leg, then the other, struggling not
to jostle Mathias’s body. JEFF That’s how it’ll happen, I think. if it
does.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: If what does? Jeff slides the soiled strips
of-denim out from under Mathias’s body, tosses them aside. He LOWERS his
voice:.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: If he dies here. infection. Blood
poisoning–something like that. Eric seems startled by this.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You think he’s gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: His back is broken. Who knows what else. Eric
is silent, motionless, the tape in his hand. Mathias’s BREATHING seems
to be getting steadily worse. Jeff bends to cut off his boxers, first
one leg, then the other. He tosses the soiled fabric aside. JEFF We
should go back down in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Down?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Into the shaft. Try to find the phone
again.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There’s no oil for the lamp. Jeff waves toward
the orange tent.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s tequila. We could pour it on some of
the clothes, tie them around one of these poles, make a torch. A
sleeping bag is lying in the clearing among the strips of nylon and
aluminum poles. Jeff steps over to pick it up. JEFF Without the phone,
he’s dead. If we have to wait for someone to come searching… He shakes
his head. Then he leans forward and carefully drapes the sleeping bag
across Mathias’s broken body.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The same.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tired. Thirsty. Hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Once the others are up, we’ll have some water.
His face is stubbled, sweat-stained. He looks ragged; they both do. He
steps to the opposite side of the clearing, unzips, begins to urinate,
with his back to Amy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff’s pov - across the hilltop</strong>: The vine covers
everything, tangled and matted, with those odd, knoll-like growths
scattered among it. The nearest-is thirty feet away. its leaves are
swaying slightly in a faint breeze, and WE SEE a flash of yellowish
white beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jeff finishes, shakes, zips, then
steps out into the vine, wading toward the tiny mound. Amy remains
beside the backboard; she watches him crouch, part the tendrils,
stare.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: What is it? Jeff gestures for her to approach.
When she reaches him, he leans forward, pulls aside the vines. WE SEE a
man’s skull, a loose tumble of bones. Amy INHALES sharply,
recoiling.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Bodies. All of them. He waves across the
hilltop, at the other mounds: there are more than a dozen. Amy takes
them in. The light is gaining strength, the green leaves seeming to
shine in it, the red flowers to glow. Jeff’s face assumes a puzzled
expression. JEFF Where are the birds?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Birds?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: it’s dawn–there should be birds. They both
stare off across the hillside: so quiet, so still.</p>
<p>****: What…? The vine has grown dramatically during the night,
reaching out from the pile of supplies at the rear of the tent to spread
across Stacy’s right leg, almost to her waist. She sits up, tries to
push it off her.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh my god… The vine is clinging to her; she
has to tear it, the sap shining slickly on her hands, visibly beginning
to burn the skin. She yanks at the tendrils, tossing them aside. STACY
Help me. Eric sits up, still only half-awake. He just stares. STACY .
It’s inside me… It’s true: one of the tendrils has pushed its way into
the wound on her leg, widening it, thrusting itself a full three inches
into her body, like a thick finger. STACY Oh, Jesus–it’s fucking inside
me. She tries to pull the tendril out, but she’s too panicky, too quick,
and the vine breaks, leaving a piece of itself snagged under her skin.
Stacy starts to SCREAM: STACY Get the knifes Eric is too shocked to
stir. He’s staring down at her leg, at the bulge beneath her skin: it
looks as if it’s moving.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Get the knife! Jeff bends, scoops up the
knife, starts toward the tent. He waves toward Mathias.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stay with him. Then he ducks in through the
tent’s flap.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The vine. It’s inside her. Stacy points to her
wound, SOBBING now:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Cut it out. You gotta cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The blade’s dirty. We should– Stacy starts
shaking her head, FRANTIC:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s moving! Can’t you see? Jeff stares at
the bulge, hesitating. Then it moves, unquestionably: contracting and
expanding, like a worm. Stacy SHRIEKS: STACY Jeff! Be gives in,
crouching over her leg.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s gonna hurt.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Please. Hurry. He leans forward, slices into
the skin above the bulge. Stacy CRIES OUT, starts to jerk away, but Jeff
presses down on her leg, holding her still. He reaches into her wound
with his finger, digs out the piece of vine, tosses it aside.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Get me a shirt or something. He gestures
toward the backpacks, and Eric unzips one of them, starts to dig through
it.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Something’s… wrong… His voice is
thick-sounding, very faint. Amy tries to soothe him; she puts her hand
on his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s okay. It’s just–</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: my-legs…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I know. You’re hurt. But we’re., gonna get
you–</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Show …me… He’s struggling to rise,
straining upward. Amy tries to stop him, pressing down on his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shh. But he fights her; he won’t be
quieted:</p>
<p><strong>mathias.</strong>: Show-me… So she leans, lifts the sleeping
bag off him. His lower legs are completely covered by the flowering
vine, from the knees down. Amy and Mathias both stare in surprise. Then
Amy reaches, starts to yank the tendrils free.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can still feel it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I got it out.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can feel it moving.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s just your body. Your muscle
twitching.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s on our clothes. Stacy and Jeff both
glance at him. There’s a faint, almost fungus-like green growing on his
shirt, an infantile version of the vine covering the hillside all around
them. It’s on all of them: their shirts, their pants, their shoes.
Before any of them can respond to this development, Amy starts to CALL
from the clearing, sounding SCARED:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff…? They all turn toward the flap. Mathias
begins to SCREAM. Amy’s voice JUMPS in volume: AMY of .I Jeff rises,
moves toward the flap.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They must’ve dug it up.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: Who? He arranges the rest of the food in a
second pile: a bag of pretzels, a can of nuts, two protein bars, a box
of raisins.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The miners. He puts the liquids in a third
pile: three bottles of water, two of iced tea, a can of Coke. That’s all
there is. JEFF And then the Mayans cleared the jungle around the hill, I
guess. To keep it quarantined. That’s why they won’t let us leave, don’t
you think? They’re afraid we’ll spread it? The others are silent. Jeff
reaches for the tuna fish sandwich. He carefully unwraps it. JEFF Or
else…I don’t know. Maybe it’s something religious? And we’re some sort
of sacrifice? He glances at the others, but once again no one responds.
They all look dazed: knocked back into themselves. Jeff picks up the
knife, wipes it on his jeans. JEFF They must’ve done the same thing with
the archaeologists. And Henrich. Trapped them here. Like us. He cuts the
sandwich into four equal sections. JEFF And then somehow it killed them
off. All of them. one by one. This is too much for Eric; he.leaps up,
looking panicky.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We have to find the phone. We have to go back
down and– Jeff makes a calming motion.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll eat first. Drink some water. We have to
stay calm. Not rush at things. He holds out one of the tiny squares of
sandwich. Eric hesitates, then accepts it, dropping back into a crouch.
Jeff hands Amy her square.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What about Mathias? She nods toward him, and
they all turn to look. From his knees down, Mathias’s legs are nothing
but bone, tendon, and ropy clots of blackened blood. His face looks
gray. His eyes are shut, and his breathing sounds terribly RAGGED.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He wouldn’t be able to stomach it. Jeff offers
Stacy her ration. She takes it, but almost absentmindedly. She seems
distracted; she keeps prodding at her wound with her fingertip. JEFF
Stop it, Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s still in there. I can feel it. She keeps
probing. Jeff shakes his head, a little it’ ATIENT:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I told you. I got it out. Jeff pops his square
of sandwich into his mouth; Eric and Amy eat theirs, too. Stacy’s ration
remains in her hand; she seems to have forgotten it. She’s sunburned,
sweat-stained, glassy-eyed. Eric leans toward her, looking worried.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Eat, Stacy. You have to eat. She places the
tiny sandwich into her mouth, chews, swallows, staring at her wound the
whole time. Then:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: See? How puffy it is?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’s just swelling. It’s natural. Right?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s what happens when you get hurt. Jeff
picks up one of the water bottles, twists off its-cap. He offers the
bottle to Stacy. JEFF one swallow apiece. The bottle makes its way
around their little circle. When it returns to Jeff, he takes his sip,
caps the bottle. Eric is watching Stacy, her anxious probing; he looks
increasingly distressed by it. He jumps up again.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The phone. Let’s find the phone. Jeff doesn’t
move. Stacy’s bloodied khakis. are lying in the dirt beside him, and he
reaches for them, starts to cut off their legs with the knife, just
above the knee.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We need to take care of Mathias, first. He
won’t last much longer like that. Amy looks appalled; she makes a
shushing motion.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: Shh. They all glance toward Mathias again. He
lies there, eyes shut, breathing in and out with that fluid-filled RASP.
He seems to be unconscious, but Jeff still LOWERS his voice:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We have to cut them off.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Cut what off?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: His legs. He’s finished with Stacy’s khakis;
they’ve been transformed into a pair of shorts. He tosses them toward
her. Eric and Amy are staring at him, shocked into silence. Then:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’ll die if we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Without anaesthesia?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There won’t be any pain. He has no feeling
beneath his waist.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He’ll lose too much blood.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The tourniquets are already in place. We’ll
cut below them.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: With what? Jeff holds up the knife. Eric
SCOFFS at the idea: ERIC That wouldn’t do a thing. You’d need a bone
saw.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We could break the bones. Then cut. Amy is
shaking her head; she looks mortified.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, Jeff. No way.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What about infection? Cutting into him with a
dirty knife?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll sterilize it. Build a fire. Heat the
blade in the flames. It’ll cauterize as it cuts.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Or save him. One or the other. We can’t
just–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Cut me first. Right here. Stacy has stood up,
pulled on the shorts Jeff has fashioned for her. She’s bent over,
pointing at a spot on her leg, a few inches below the last incision.
STACY Sterilize the knife and– Eric steps toward her, tries to soothe
her.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There’s nothing there, Stacy. It’s</p>
<p><strong>just–</strong>: She hardly seems to hear him. She’s
frightened, growing a little wild with it. Her voice comes FAST AND
HIGH:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s moving. I can feel it moving.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re imagining it. You’re scared, and
you–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I gotta get out of here. I gotta get to a
hospital. I gotta– Eric takes her hand, squeezing it. Stacy blinks at
him, close to tears.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You have to calm down. Can you do that? Can
you try to calm down? Stacy pulls free of him, drops into a crouch,
hugging her knees to her chest, her eyes shut.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: See if there’s a signal.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Your phone. Check your phone. Eric doesn’t
move: he knows there’s no point. STACY Check it. Eric SIGHS, steps to
his pack, crouches to remove his phone. He flips it open, holds it out
to Stacy. She stares down at it: there’s no signal. Eric drops it back
into his pack. Then he turns to Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We go back down. We find the other phone. We
call for help. That’s how we get out of here. That’s how we save
him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’11 take too long.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: One call, Jeff. They’ll be here by
sundown.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And Mathias will already be dying. You
understand? There’s no flesh covering his bones. They’re– Mathias’s
voice interrupts him, from the backboard. Very HOARSE, barely
audible:</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Do…it… They all turn, stare toward him. His
eyes are open. MATHIAS Please… Cut… them… off… He slowly, painfully,
extends his left hand toward them, a beseeching gesture.</p>
<p><strong>cu - small pile of clothes</strong>: A pair of shorts, a
woman’s blouse, two black socks.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ll have to break the bones first. An amber
liquid is being poured onto the clothes, very slowly. WE PULL BACK TO
REVEAL:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: With the stone. Then I’ll use the knife to
cut. A large stone sits beside the pile of clothes, shaped like an ax
head. There’s the knife, too, and the metal canteen from the orange
tent. JEFF We’ll heat the canteen, and cauterize the wounds with it. To
stop the bleeding. Eric strikes a match: the clothes catch instantly,
burning with a low blue flame. He sets the knife in the fire, then the
stone, and splashes more tequila on them. The girls stand in the center
of the clearing, watching. JEFF You shouldn’t be able to feel a thing.
But you can bite this if you want. Just in case. He holds up one of the
belts. Mathias hesitates, then opens his mouth, and Jeff sets it
carefully inside. Mathias clamps down, gripping it between his teeth.
Jeff glances at Eric. JEFF Ready? Eric nods.- The stone is making a
cracking sound in the fire, glowing a.deep red. Jeff turns back to
Mathias. JEFF You? Mathias also nods, shutting his eyes. There’s a small
towel in the dirt beside Jeff, and he. picks it up, wrapping it around
his hand. He looks over his shoulder at the girls. They both seem
terrified, shaky with it.</p>
<p><strong>mathias</strong>: Stop…stop… Jeff ignores him, dropping the
canteen back into the fire, lifting out the stone. Eric looks
increasingly mortified; he seems close to tears.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Reep him still. He turns, SMASHES the stone
into Mathias’s right leg. Mathias begins to SCREAM, bucking against
Eric’s grip.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh, Jesus. Jesus Christ. Amy emerges from the
tent, then Stacy. They stand staring.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He felt it, didn’t he? The whole thing. Jeff
lifts the canteen away.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He couldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He was screaming. Be was telling you to
stop.</p>
<p><strong>jepf</strong>: It was just seeing it. Looking down, and– Amy
is shaking her head, staring at Mathias with that appalled expression:
his slack face, his burned stumps.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This is bad, Jeff. So bad. Jeff leans to loosen
first one tourniquet, then the other.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ve bought him some time. He wouldn’t
have–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You cut off his legs! You– Stacy SCREAMS,
pointing toward Mathias’s amputated limbs. They’re lying in the dirt at
the base of the backboard, the bloodstained bones held together with a
few remaining cords of flesh. A vine has come snaking into the clearing:
it’s wrapping itself around one of the feet. As the tendril begins to
drag. the bones away, a.second one slithers forward and lays claim to
the other foot. Eric grabs the knife, jumps up, steps on the first
tendril, bends to slash at it with the blade. He swoops toward the
second one. Even as he does so, though, a third tendril slithers into
the clearing, then a fourth. Stacy SCREAMS again, short and loud, and
backs toward the tent; Eric bends and slashes, bends and slashes, and
the’vine keeps coming, from all directions, reaching for the bones.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Leave it. Eric ignores him, cutting and
stomping and tearing at the tendrils, faster and faster, but still too
slow, the vine fighting back, wrapping itself around his legs. JEFF
Eric. He steps toward him, grabs his arm, pulls him away. They stand
side by side, watching as the vine pulls the severed limbs into itself,
the white of the bones vanishing into the larger mass of green. Stacy
has begun to CRY again. There’s a beat of stillness, and then, once
more, echoing up toward them from the shaft, comes that faint electronic
RINGING of the cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>cu - the windlass</strong>: Spinning, the rope spooling
quickly off the barrel.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know how long it’11 burn–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So you’ll have to be quick. He has one of the
aluminum poles from the blue tent. He’s wrapped duct tape around its
bottom for a grip, tied some of the archaeologists’ clothes around the
top. He’s dribbling tequila on the knot of fabric, saturating it. JEFF
Wait to light it till you’re both down there. Then–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Who? Jeff looks up at her, startled by the
question. Eric is moving along the length of rope, bent low, checking
its hemp for signs of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who what?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Who’s going?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You and Amy. They all look bad, but Stacy
looks the worst: her wounded leg,, -her greasy hair, a panicky edge to
every gesture. She shakes her head, with vehemence.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No, Jeff. No way. Not me. Jeff caps the
tequila bottle, gives Stacy a tired look.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ve already been through this. Eric and I
need to work the winch. You’re not strong enough. Eric has reached the
end of the rope; he stands up, wiping his hands on his pants.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s clear. He moves to the windlass, starts
to wind the rope back onto the barrel. They’ve tied a sling on the
rope’s end again. Stacy is pressing her right hand against the bottom of
her rib cage: massaging, probing</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Why can’t Amy go on her own?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The torch won’t last that long. We need you
both there, searching. Stacy starts shaking her head again,
TERRIFIED:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m not going. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t have a choice, Stacy. Amy can see
where this is headed; she tries to divert it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll go alone. Jeff ignores this. He
rises to his feet, still focused on Stacy. WE can HEAR his growing anger
in his voice:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: if we don’t find the phone, Mathias will die.
Understand? Stacy is silent, hugging herself, staring at the ground.
Eric has finished winding the rope onto the windlass. He tries to
intervene:</p>
<p><strong>jeff–</strong>: Jeff ignores him, his gaze on Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So that’s what you’re saying. Just to be
clear. That you’re not willing to help him live.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Come on, man. She’s too scared.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t give a fuck. I’m scared, too. We all
are.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: it was inside her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And we got it out. Now she needs to stop being
such a fucking baby, stop being so selfish, and– Eric is stepping toward
him suddenly, right up against him, forcing him back a step.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: ,hut Up. Okay? He’s bigger than Jeff,
stronger, and this is suddenly very palpable. Their faces are three
inches apart. A tense beat, and then, more QUIETLY: ERIC You’re being
too hard. Jeff gives him a look of incredulity, almost disgust.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hard?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Just leave her be. Jeff turns away from him,
from all three of them. He stares off across the hill for a beat, then
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m the only one thinking. I’m carrying the
whole fucking load.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: So stop. Lay it down. Jeff turns back to him,
gives him a look of pure contempt; WE can HEAR his fury rising again as
he speaks:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: This isn’t just going to work out on its own,
Eric. You know? Magically?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m not saying–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We could end up dead here. All of us. Is that
what you want?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Then get the fuck out of my way, and start
helping me. He holds Eric’s eyes long enough to confirm that Eric isn’t
going to protest, then he glances past him at Stacy. JEFF You going or
not? Stacy-is still staring at the ground, her hand probing at her
chest. It’s clear she doesn’t want to go, but Jeff has shamed her into
silence. Amy reaches, touches her arm.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: .’-11 be right there. Okay? We’ll be together
the whole time. A long beat, then Stacy manages a nod. It’s enough for
Jeff; he pushes past Eric, moving toward the windlass.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Get in the sling, Amy. Amy turns, reaching for
the sling.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Pull it up! The CREAKING resumes. She stands
there in the dimness, watching the sling rise away from her. She has the
makeshift torch in one hand, the box of matches in the other.</p>
<p><strong>the bottom of the shaft</strong>: Amy is in a crouch. She
keeps glancing toward the stone arch cut into the shaft’s wall, and the
passageway beyond it: the vine dangles from.the low ceiling, like
streamers at a party. The CREAKING resumes, and Amy looks up.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s pov - above her</strong>: Stacy is dropping slowly
toward us.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Amy glances toward the arch again. A
slight draft blows steadily from it, and the vine shifts and trembles in
it. A beat, then the RINGING starts up once more. It’s coming from
within the shadowed passageway. Amy opens the box of matches, plucks one
out. She’s too jumpy, though; her hands are-trembling so much that she
shakes the match out as soon as it’s lit. There’s a second RING. Stacy
has nearly reached us. Amy digs another match from the box. Stacy’s feet
touch the bottom of the shaft; she yanks off the sling. There’s a third
RING.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hurry. Amy strikes the match, holds it to the
knot of clothing at the end of the aluminum pole. The alcohol catches
with a FLUTTERING sound, a cloud of pale blue fire materializing around
the torch. Amy lifts it, and they start into:</p>
<p><strong>the underground passage</strong>: Stacy is in front, with Amy
right behind her. The torch shudders weakly in the steady draft; the
shaft’s ceiling is low enough that they have to crouch as they move
forward. There’s a fourth RING, drawing them deeper down the
passage.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Wait… She pauses, lifting the torch, but Stacy
keeps going. Amy peers at the vine hanging from the wall. There’s a
fifth RING, echoing eerily, and the flowers move in exact unison with
the sound, their stamens vibrating, like so many miniature tuning forks:
the plant is making the noise. AMY Stacy… The shaft dead-ends at a blank
wall, which is just materializing out of the darkness, fifteen feet in
front of them. There’s a sixth RING. Stacy points at the wall,
quickening her pace.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s right here. I can– Amy jumps forward,
reaching for her.</p>
<p><strong>don’t–</strong>: But there’s another RING, and Stacy keeps
going: she’s nearly at the wall.</p>
<p><strong>it’s–</strong>: Stop! Amy grabs her arm, hard, jerks her back
a step, pulling her close, the torchlight flickering over them. She
WHISPERS: AMY There’s no phone.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What? A seventh RING sounds, seeming to come
from beneath the vines on the floor of the shaft, directly in front of
them. Stacy tries to pull free, to bend and reach toward the sound.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: It’s the vine. The flowers. They’re making the
noise.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No. It’s– She pulls free, steps forward, and
her foot seems to punch straight through the shaft’s floor. She SCREAMS,
losing her balances Amy throws down the torch, lunges for her. The torch
flutters, pales, but remains lit. The vines growing across the floor
fall away, revealing an opening, another shaft, dropping into the earth.
Stacy is slowly sliding into it, scrambling to stop herself. Amy grabs
Stacy arm. Stacy is dangling, from the waist down, over the hole’s edge.
There are vines in the hole, too, and. they begin to coil around her
legs, pulling at her, dragging her downward. Stacy SCREAMS again,
kicking to free herself, scrambling upward, monkey-like, while Amy pulls
at her, and finally they manage to drag her to safety. A beat, then Amy
retrieves the torch, holds it out over the hole. The bottom is twenty
feet down, almost lost in shadow. Dimly, WE SEE a woman, lying curled
against the wall–she has long dark hair. STACY Oh my God. The woman
stirs, her body rolling, as if to turn and look at us, and WE SEE her
face: she’s a corpse. The vine has invaded her flesh–it’s in her eye
sockets, the hollow of her mouth, writhing and churning. Stacy and Amy
SCREAM. There’s a WHISTLING sound, like a whip, and a tendril lashes out
from the shaft’s wall, wraps itself around the torch’s handle, yanks it
from Amy’s grip. The torch falls into the hole, still burning. When it
hits bottom, a mass of vine surges across it, smothering its flame. It’s
very dark after this: Amy and Stacy are barely discernible. A beat of
silence, then an odd, high-pitched CACKLING rises all around them; it
sounds like laughter– eerie, childlike, full of echoes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You. But Stacy is too hysterical: she just
stands there, SOBBING, SCREAMING. Jeff’s voice comes toward them from
above,</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amoy…? Amy pulls the sling over her own head.
YELLS:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Pull us up!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>nmi</strong>: She reaches out, grabs Stacy, wrapping her arms
and legs around her. Stacy returns the embrace, both of them clutching
at each other, as the windlass finally begins to CREAK, lifting the two
of them into the air.</p>
<p><strong>on amy and stacy - in the sling</strong>: The vines hanging
from the shaft’s walls whip at the girls as they rise, coiling around
their bodies, pulling at them, that strange LAUGHTER growing ever
louder, seeming to buffet their bodies. Stacy and Amy grip each other
with all their strength, eyes shut tight. Stacy SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Check your phone. Eric pushes himself to his
feet, steps toward his pack. He pulls out his phone, flips it open. He
shakes his head. STACY Let me see. Eric carries the phone to her, then
stands over her while she opens it, stares down at it. She shuts it,
opens it again. Then again, and again, and suddenly she’s CRYING, bent
into herself. Eric drops to a crouch, rests his hand on her knee.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shh. But her crying increases; she begins to
SOB. Jeff is bent’ over the orange, dividing it into four equal
piles–its peel, too–concentrating. He lifts his head, stares. Amy stands
up, hurries over., kneels in front of Stacy, takes her hand.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s okay, sweetie. You’re okay. Stacy keeps
WEEPING, uncontrollably, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I wanner go home. I wanna leave…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shh… She’s WAILING, rocking back and forth;
she can’t seem to stop. Amy struggles to calm her.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stacy… Stacy keeps WAILING, rocking, eyes shut.
Amy leans in close. AMY Let’s play the game…can you do that? Huh? Can
you give me a “So”? Stacy continues to CRY. AMY Come on. Just try. Can
you try? So there was this girl who wanted to be a pilot. Stacy’s tears
keep coming. Amy looks at Eric, gives him a nod,’prodding him into
speech. He hesitates, then:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But she was scared of heights.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So she became a lifeguard instead.</p>
<p>****: Come on. Your turn. More SOBS. Amy glances across the clearing
at Jeff, wanting him to join in, too. It seems as if he might refuse,
but then her look hardens, and he relents.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But she couldn’t swim.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So she wore a life vest.</p>
<p>****: Come on. Now you. A beat, then Stacy takes a deep, ragged
breath. She wipes at her face, struggles for words.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: But everyone… She trails off, CRYING again.
Amy nods, encouraging her.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah…? Everyone what?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: They laughed at her.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Good. That’s good. So she– Very suddenly, it
starts to rain–a dozen large, heavy drops. They all glance skyward.</p>
<p><strong>shit�</strong>: He springs to his feet. And then: a downpour,
a deluge, as if a trap door has swung open in the clouds. The rain falls
in a loud, drumming rush, turning the clearing to mud. Eric jumps up,
too. He and Jeff start digging through the backpacks from the. blue
tent, searching for something– anything–in which to catch the water.
They find a small plastic bag, a nylon toiletry kit, a Frisbee. Jeff
sets these in a row on the ground, open to the rain. Eric rushes to the
orange tent, vanishes inside. Amy tilts back her head, tries to catch
the rain in her open mouth. Stacy just sits there, hugging herself,
shivering, still half- crying. They’re all drenched, back-spattered with
mud. And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the rain starts to slacken.
Eric reemerges from the orange tent, carrying a thermos, a plastic cup.
He sets them next to the other containers, but it’s pointless; the rain
is already stopping. They all stare at these meager receptacles: they’ve
managed to catch less than half an inch of muddy-looking water. Jeff.
GROANS; he’s FURIOUS with himself:</p>
<p><strong>should’ve-</strong>: He kicks the Frisbee across the
clearing. Amy jumps up.</p>
<p><strong>jefft</strong>: She steps forward, as if to guard the other
containers.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It doesn’t fucking matter.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There was water in it. He spins toward her,
turning his fury with himself on her:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How much, Amy? Two and a half gallons? ’Cause
that’s what we need. For today–just to make it through today. And then
tomorrow the same all over again. And for how long? Another week before
our parents start searching? And then what? How long till they track us
to Coba? Or to this fucking hill? How long will it take, Amy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You said–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s not gonna happen. We’re not gonna make
it. The others stare at him in astonishment, too ’stunned to speak. He
gives them all a look of disgust: JEFF And you’re fucking playing games.
So there were these people trapped in the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Don’t, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But they didn’t have any water.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So they’re gonna die of thirst. Amy covers her
ears with her hands.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But this fucking vine might kill them
first.</p>
<p><strong>stop it!</strong>: Jeff paces away, struggling to regain
control of himself. A long beat, and then, very QUIETLY:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m sorry …I’m sorry. He steps back toward the
dismembered orange, crouches over it. The fruit and peels are muddy now,
spoiled looking. He waves for the others to approach. JEFF Come on. We
need to eat. No one moves. They’re all staring at him with their shocked
expressions. He can’t seem to meet their eyes. He gestures at the orange
again. JEFF The peel, too. Everything. Abeat, then the others step
forward to claim their portions: first Eric, then Stacy, then Amy. They
eat without speaking. Finally, almost AS IF TALKING TO HIMSELF: JEFF
It’ll rain again. It has to. And we’ll figure out a way to catch it.
We’ll be fine. We’ll ration the -food. And then, you know, we’ll
just…we’ll tough it out..</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What about the vine? Jeff takes his sip, caps
the bottle. He’s reclaiming himself, his voice strengthening, his
confidence returning.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t think it can hurt us. Not directly. if
it could, it already would’ve, wouldn’t it? Why would it wait? The
others are silent, considering this. Then: JEFF It’s not strong enough
to overpower us. And it– Mathias GASPS suddenly, his entire body
spasming for a moment, before the watery RASP of his breathing resumes.
He doesn’t regain consciousness; his eyes remain shut. Everyone watches
him for a beat: he, also, is spattered with mud.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He’s gonna die, isn’t he? if there’s no phone,
then there’s no–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Me, too. They all turn to look at her. She’s
massaging that spot on her rib cage again, digging into it with her
fingers. STACY It’s eating me. Just like him. And her. She waves toward
the shaft. Jeff gives her a weary look.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t, Stacy. Don’t start. She jumps up,
begins to pace, agitated.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s inside me. In my leg. My chest. I can
feel it. Right here.. She stops pacing, lifts her shirt. She points to
the base of her rib cage. STACY See? Jeff stares; there’s nothing there.
He shakes his head. The knife is lying in the mud beside him, and Stacy
steps forward, snatches it up. Jeff reaches to stop her, but he’s too
slow. She stands before him, hefting it. in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’ll show you. She lifts her.shirt again,
pressing at her rib cage with her .fingertips. Jeff stands up, holds out
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Give it to me. Right now. Amy and Eric stand,
too.</p>
<p><strong>stacy–</strong>: But she’s already cutting: a four inch slit
along the base of her rib cage. Amy SCREAMS. A horizontal line of blood
crests the wound, sweeps down across Stacy’s stomach, soaking into the
waistband of her shorts. She watches it, frowning.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I thought it would just come tumbling out.
She probes at the cut with the point of the knife, prying it farther
open, the bleeding increasing. Jeff reaches, grabs the knife from her.
He looks furious:</p>
<p><strong>jeff .</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s hiding. It’s right– She pokes her finger
into the wound, digging. Jeff slaps her hand away. He YELLS:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: a il h� f down i He shoves her down, onto her
back, then picks up the towel he’d used to hold the heated stone. He
balls it up, presses it to Stacy’s wound. Eric retrieves the bottle of
tequila from the mud, uncaps it. He crouches beside Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t yell. she’s just scared.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: what’re you doing? He’s lifting the bottle
toward Stacy’s mouth, but he hesitates now, turning toward Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Just a sip. To calm her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’ll dehydrate-her.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A sip, Jeff. He starts to lift the bottle
again. Jeff shoves it aside.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I said Q.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Leave him alone. She tries to sit up, but
Jeff pushes her back down, hard.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You realize how stupid you’re being? Sticking
that dirty knife</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s growing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: of ina’s.inside you. You’re imagining it, and
you just–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m gonna end up like her. That girl. I’m
gonna–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Get infected. Understand? You’re gonna get
yourself killed.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You’re not listening.</p>
<p><strong>you’re not listening!</strong>: A beat of startled silence,
and then her voice comes again, from across the hilltop, sounding
exactly like her, only slightly fuzzed, a rasping quality just beneath
the words:</p>
<p><strong>you’re not listening!</strong>: They all turn to look, but
there’s nothing there, just the vine, its green leaves, its bright red
flowers. Stacy’s voice comes once more, from the.opposite direction now:
STACY’S VOICE</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What the– Stacy’s voice keeps coming,
switching locations, seeming to float across the hilltop; they turn,
tracking it.</p>
<p><strong>listening…!</strong>: Amy steps toward Jeff, looking
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The Mayans.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No–it’s the vine. It’s mimicking her. Stacy
has started to CRY; she covers her ears with her hands.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Make it stop.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Please. Make it stop.</p>
<p><strong>listening…!</strong>: Stacy tries to sit up, but Jeff pushes
her back down. Se’s still crouched over her, pressing the towel to her
wound; it’s completely soaked through with blood now. Stacy YELLS:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Shut up…! Stacy’s voice continues, but now
that high-pitched LAUGHTER is coming, too, a chorus of it, growing in
volume:</p>
<p><strong>listening…!</strong>: Stacy’s weeping has deepened to SOBS.
She keeps YELLING:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Shut up…! Shut up…! The LAUGHTER grows
steadily LOUDER, obscuring Stacy’s voice: WE SEE the flowers trembling,
visibly vibrating as they sculpt the sound…</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: Now is he? Eric shrugs, waves toward the
backboard: it seems clear enough. Amy stares-for a moment, then sits
beside him. AMY You can go lie down if you want. Eric lifts his hand,
pushes a button on his watch, makes it glow. He squints at it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I still have forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t mind. I can’t sleep. Eric checks his
watch again, its glow briefly illuminating his face. He gestures toward
the tent.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Is Stacy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They both are. There’s a slight breeze, and the
tent makes a FLAPPING SOUND in it. They both turn to stare at it. Then:
AMY Do you think it’s inside her?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Jeff cut it out. I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But she says she can feel it. Moving. Shifting
about. Eric waves this aside.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You know how Stacy is. She’s just scared. She
gets things in her head, and— Mathias makes a RETCHING sound–loud, wet,
painful–and they both turn,•peering at his gaunt form through the
darkness. He falls QUIET; his eyes don’t open. A beat, then: ERIC I’ve
been sitting here, you know, making all these deals in my head with God.
You ever do that? Amy just stares at him. He has his arms wrapped around
his knees, hugging them to his chest. ERIC Like I say, okay, you can
fire me on the first day teaching if that’s what you want–just let us
make it home. But that doesn’t mean shit, ’cause I don’t even really
want the job, and He has to know that, doesn’t He? So I say, all right,
Stacy can leave me, you know, or even, I don’t know, I’ll give up a
finger, okay? Or two fingers. Or fuck it, take a hand, take my left
hand, but let us just get home, all of us. And then I look at him– –and
I can’t help it, I’m, like, take him if you need to, take Mathias, and
let the rest of us go. That’s fucking horrible, isn’t it? And once I’ve
said it, I feel like I can’t take it back, you know?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m sorry …I’m so sorry… It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: what is?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: If I hadn’t stepped onto the hill– Her crying
INCREASES. Eric leans, touches her hand.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’s stupid, Amy. That’s–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff said it. He said– Eric reaches, puts his
arm around her, trying to quiet her.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He didn’t mean it. There’s no way. He was
just–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We might not have…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shh. Don’t. She rests her head on his
shoulder, WEEPING, her body shaking with it, while he pats her, stroking
her hair.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wh–? Stacy holds her finger to her lips,
silencing him.. From outside, there’s another MOAN. Jeff sits up,
listening. The PANTING is BUILDING toward a climax. Jeff leans toward
the pile of supplies at the tent’s rear, squinting at the tangle of vine
growing across it. He points, WHISPERING: JEFF It’s the– But Stacy is
already pushing herself to her feet. She moves quickly to the tent’s
flap, UNZIPS it, crouches out into:</p>
<p><strong>. stacy</strong>: What the fuck, Eric? Amy lifts her head,
wipes at her face; Eric drops his arm from her shoulder. They both stare
at Stacy, startled by her anger. Jeff appears behind her, stepping
through the flap.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We heard you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Heard me what?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Fucking her.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The vine. it made it sound as if you two–
Stacy turns toward him, SNORTING, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You’re so blind.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I could hear it. At the back of the tent. It
was–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It doesn’t make things up. It mimics things.
Things it’s heard.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Then it’s heard someone having sex at some
point. Slowly, quietly, a tendril has begun to slither forward through
the darkness, creeping in beneath the lean-to, snaking toward Mathias,
toward his head. Jeff and the others are all too focused on one another
to notice.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: That was Ay, Jeff. Moaning.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What? Jeff reaches, touches Stacy’s arm,
struggling to calm her, but she flinches from him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: it’s doing this on purpose.’ Can’t you see? It
thinks you’re the weakest–because you’re hurt. So it’s trying to upset
you. Trying</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You’re not upset? He had his arm around her.
He– Amy leans forward, hands out, BESEECHING:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Nothing happened, Stacy. I was crying. And
Eric–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We he-ar you. The vine starts to push its way
in between Mathias’s lips, into his mouth. Mathias makes a GAGGING
sound, but doesn’t regain consciousness: once more, no one notices.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We heard the vine. It–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You’re such a fool, Jeff. You think she’s
never cheated on you? Perfect little angelic Amy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I could tell you secrets. I could open your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shi i up. Right now. A second tendril has
slithered under the lean-to. It covers Mathias’s nose, drawing itself
tight. The steady rasping of his breathing is CUT OFF. Yet again, no one
notices.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Spring break? Senior year?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You bitch. You stupid cunt. Stacy spins on her,
VENOMOUS:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Fuck you. Slut. Twice, Jeff. Two different
guys. And one of them– Jeff grabs her arm, grips it, silencing hers</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Enough, Stacy. Stoll.</p>
<p><strong>mathias–</strong>: He turns, stares: sees. He darts forward,
starts to yank away the tendrils. They resist him, writhing, clinging to
Mathias’s face. Eric and Amy both jump up. Stacy has started to CRY,
shaking her head, MORTIFIED:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh, god…oh please no… Jeff bends close to
Mathias’s face, listening; he checks Mathias’s neck for a pulse. A beat,
then he turns toward the others, shakes his head. Stacy begins to SOB:
STACY I’m sorry…I’m so sorry… Eric reaches, takes her into his arms,
hugging her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They must’ve salted the soil. That’s the only
way I can think. He turns, glances at Amy. She has no idea what he’s
talking about. He waves down toward the Mayans.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It didn’t happen. Jeff turns, stares at her.
she waves back toward the tent. AMY Eric and I, we were just—</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: And what she said. About spring break. I– Jeff
reaches, presses his finger to her lips.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Shh. Amy falls silent, watching him. He lowers
his finger. JEFF Have you made it up with her? Amy half-nods,
half-shrugs. JEFF Good.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But I want to tell you–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I wish it mattered. Amy gives him a confused
look. Jeff throws out his hand,. gesturing at the hilltop, the vine,
their tattered clothes. JEFF Look at us. Would it matter to you? Amy
hesitates, considering. Then she shakes her head. And with that, Jeff
turns, starts back toward the orange tent. WE HEAR a zipping sound,
which carries over into:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Head first? Eric considers this, staring down
at Mathias’s body. Mathias’s face is burned red from the vine’s sap; his
legs are two blackened stumps. Eric shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’ll have to lift him. Eric hesitates; he
seems reluctant to touch the corpse. Finally, he girds himself,
straddles the backboard, grabs Mathias under his armpits, lifting him.
Jeff leans forward, starts to pull the sleeping bag over Mathias’s head.
The corpse seems intent upon resisting them; its arms keep getting
tangled, catching and snagging. Jeff and Eric have to wrestle with it,
both of them PANTING, sweating, before they manage to shove it into the
bag. Jeff ZIPS the bag shut, and they stand over it, catching their
breath, wiping the perspiration from their faces.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Should we say something?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Where’s the knife? They all turn. Her hand is
under her tattered shirt, pressing at her lower back. Jeff SIGHS:</p>
<p><strong>stacy–</strong>: She lifts her shirt, twisting to show him.
it looks as if a large starfish has been implanted just beneath her
skin. It’s moving, too, inching slowly but visibly downward. They all
stare in astonishment. Amy GASPS, points at Stacy’s leg. Stacy bends to
see: there’s more vine here, a snakelike lump winding its way upward
from the top of her shin to her inner thigh.</p>
<p><strong>cu - fire</strong>: Another small pile of clothes, burning
with that blue, alcohol-fueled flame.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Can I give her some? The knife is placed in the
fire, and WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hold her hands.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I want to see. Jeff hesitates; for a moment
it seems-as if he might argue. But then, very quickly, he leans forward
and draws the knife in one smooth movement up and around Stacy’s leg.
Stacy MOANS, her body tensing, but she doesn’t cry out. The incision
reveals the vine, a foot long, its leaves and flowers clotted with
Stacy’s blood, which is oozing from the wound. Jeff reaches in, pries
the tendril from her flesh. Stacy MOANS again, arching backward, as the
vine emerges: writhing and twisting. The blood comes more thickly now,
pumping from the wound, running down her leg. Jeff drops the tendril
into the dirt, steps on it, grinding it into stillness. Stacy is
breathing HARD, almost hyperventilating. She’s shut her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Should I stop? Stacy shakes her head,
vehemently. Jeff glances at the others. Eric shakes his head, too. Amy’s
eyes, like Stacy’s, are tightly shut. JEFF You’ll have to roll over.
Stacy lets go of the others’ hands, rolls onto her stomach. She hitches
up her shirt, revealing the small of her back, the starfish-shaped
bulge. Jeff crouches at her side. JEFF Ready? She nods, and he leans,
makes five quick incisions, in the shape of an asterisk, directly above
the bulge. Stacy’s body goes rigid, and Eric takes her hand again. Once
more, we can see the tendril through the incision: dark with her blood.
Jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body. There’s an
astonishing amount of it; he has to drop the knife and use both hands to
drag the slimy mass free.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can you eat? Stacy sits up, wincing; her
bandages are soaked through with blood. She takes the grapes from him;
Eric does, too. They- all begin to eat, in silence. When they’re done,
Jeff passes the water bottle around their circle. Then: JEFF We should
try to rest, I guess. Get out of the sun. We’re losing moisture out–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: There’s more of it. She leans forward, probes
at her right thigh, prodding the skin. The others watch her; there’s no
bulge visible, no sign of the vine-at all. Eric gives her a pained
look.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There’s nothing there, Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s under the muscle. Down by the bone.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’re losing too much blood. And if any of
these get infected—</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: My calf, too. she lifts her right leg,
turning it to show the others. Jeff bends to look. Again, there’s no
visible sign of the vine. He shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No more cutting. Not unless— The knife is in
the dirt beside him, and Stacy leans forward, tries to grab it. Jeff is
too quick for her, though: he snatches it up, tucks it into his belt.
Stacy is becoming more and more upset. She holds out her hands,
BEGGING:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Please, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You can’t. You can’t keep– Stacy is starting
to CRY; her mouth is trembling.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s everywhere. She’s prodding at her body:
her legs, her chest and stomach. Amy scoots toward her, grasps her
hand.</p>
<p><strong>stacy–</strong>: Stacy yanks her hand free, clutches her
scalp, WEEPING:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s in my head! I can feel it in my head!
Amy takes Stacy in her arms, hugging her tight..</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shh. Stacy SOBS into Amy’s shoulder, her body
jumping. Amy strokes her. Eric steps across the clearing, picks up the
bottle of tequila. He glances at Jeff, and Jeff nods. AMY You’re scared,
honey. You’re just scared. You know? Stacy nods; she’s still CRYING, but
it’s growing quieter. Eric crouches beside her, holds out the bottle of
tequila. Stacy just stares at it. Amy encourages her: AMY It’ll help.
Stacy accepts the bottle, takes a long swallow. Then another. The others
watch her in silence. Finally: AMY Can you rest some? In the tent? Stacy
is silent. She wipes the tears from her face.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: That girl– I keep seeing her. When I shut my
eyes.</p>
<p>****: I know…I know. Let’s just lie down for a bit. Okay? Stacy
hesitates, staring up at Amy. Then she reaches, grasps her hand. Amy
pulls her to her feet, helps her hobble across the clearing to the tent.
Jeff and Eric sit-there, watching in silence as they vanish through the
flap.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh my God. Stacy is on the far side of the
clearing. She’s pulled off her shirt, her shorts, and has cut much of
the skin from her body. She doesn’t notice them. She’s bent over,
slicing into her left thigh, peeling the skin back from the muscle.</p>
<p><strong>stacy–</strong>: She turns, blood-streaked, wild-eyed, the
knife in her hand; her skin is hanging from her in shreds. We can see
her leg muscles, her abdominals, a glint of bone at her left elbow. Jeff
starts forward, holding out his hand, very STERN:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Give it. Now. Eric follows him. Amy stays by
the tent; she’s begun to CRY.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please, honey. Just– Stacy shakes her head;
she’s CRYING, too, her whole body shaking. Her hair is matted with
blood; she looks terrified.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I have to get it out. It’s– Jeff darts
forward, tries to grab the knife from her, and she slashes at him,
SHOUTING: STACY Leave me alonel The blade slices into his palm. Jeff
jumps back, cradling his hand at his chest. STACY I have to– Eric steps
toward her, from behind, reaching around her body for the knife, and she
spins, reflexively, trying to fend him off. But the knife is in her
hand, and it punches into his chest, just to the right of his sternum,
sticking there.</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Please. Just–</p>
<p><strong>any</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It hurts. It hurts so much. Eric tries to
rise again. The blood surges from his wound when he moves. Jeff presses
him back down.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Easy. Try to– Stacy clutches at Amy, begging,
her voice HOARSE with pain:</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Kill me. I can’t She stops in mid-sentence,
staring. Jeff and Amy follow her gaze. A half dozen tendrils are snaking
into the clearing, reaching toward Eric’s body. Jeff jumps to his feet.
The tendrils begin to wrap themselves around Eric’s limbs, and Jeff
bends to tear them away. More and more keep coming, though. Eric has
started to convulse, GAGGING, his head cocked back. Jeff keeps yanking
the tendrils away, but there are far too many of them; they coil around
Eric’s legs, pulling at him. The blood has stopped pumping from his
wound; his body has gone still.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff I She points toward the tent. Jeff turns
to see.</p>
<p><strong>jeff’s pov - across the clearing</strong>: The sleeping bag
in which they’d enshrouded Mathias is moving: he’s thrashing about
within it, struggling to sit up. And he’s SHOUTING, too, his voice
MUFFLED by the bag:</p>
<p><strong>henrich…! henrich…!</strong>: He seems to be tearing at the
bag with his arms.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jeff hesitates just for an instant,
staring in astonishment, then he’s sprinting across the clearing. He
bends, struggles for the zipper.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s okay. I’m right here. I’m– He UNZIPS the
bag, and an immense tangle of vine cascades out onto the dirt. Its
flowers are a pale pink; they’re opening and closing, still calling,
louder now:</p>
<p><strong>henrich…! henrich…!</strong>: The thick clot of tendrils
writhes spasmodically, coiling and uncoiling.</p>
<p><strong>kill me…! kill me…!</strong>: Jeff stands there, perfectly
still. Amy is holding Stacy, struggling unsuccessfully to quiet her:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shh. Shh. The vine’s laughter grows steadily.
LOUDER, punctuated by Stacy’s SHOUTS:</p>
<p><strong>kill me…! kill me…:</strong>: Amy turns, stares at Jeff.
Blood is running off Stacy’s body in strings. The vine has dragged Eric
to the edge of the clearing; only his head and torso are still visible.
Jeff strides toward him. STACY</p>
<p><strong>kill me…! kill me…!</strong>: Jeff bends, yanks the knife
from Eric’s chest. Then he starts across the clearing toward Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>kill me…! kill me…i kill–</strong>: And then, abruptly, it
goes SILENT.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Come on. You’ll need the energy. He reaches
for her hand, puts the banana in it. She holds the fruit, but makes no
move to eat. Finally, VERY QUIETLY:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I still think we should wait. Jeff SIGHS: it’s
clear they’ve already been through this.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’ll only get weaker.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They’ll come looking. You said</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nobody’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Our parents–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: All they’ll find are our bones. Amy is silent,
staring down at the banana. JEFF We don’t have time for this, Amy.
You’ll need as much daylight as possible. He waves upward, toward the
sun, which has passed its peak, begun its slow slide westward. Amy
squints toward it for a beat, and then, almost despite herself, lifts
the banana to her mouth. She bites, chews, swallows, still mutely
crying. Jeff peels the second banana; he hands it to her as soon as she
finishes the first. Be watches her eat,.silent. He’s tearing open the
bag of pretzels when another tendril snakes into the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t want to. I don’t… She shakes her head,
wipes at her face: the tears, the snot, the sweat, the dirt. Her clothes
are falling off her body, eaten to shreds. Jeff’s, too. AMY Why can’t we
both? Jeff hesitates a.beat. Then, clearly not believing it:</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We might. He hands her the pretzels; she takes
them, watching his face.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’ll take them a moment to react. If I can
make it to the trees… He trails off, shrugs. Amy keeps staring at him;
she doesn’t believe this either. He SIGHS again, holds up his hand,
pulls the bandage from his wound: it’s three inches long, a deep gash
into his palm. JEFF How long till it’s inside me? Amy is silent. He
flexes his hand, and the wound opens, mouthlike, blood oozing thickly
from it. JEFF It already is, probably. I’ll be just like Stacy soon. He
turns, glances toward the spot where her body has disappeared. Amy
looks, too.</p>
<p><strong>the mayans’ pov - up the hill</strong>: Jeff is approaching
down the trail, carrying Amy, pieta-like, in his arms. Her body is limp,
apparently lifeless, and dripping with blood.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The bald Mayan emerges from the tree
line, followed by yet another man with a bow. They join the other three
Mayans in the center of the clearing. They all watch as Jeff reaches the
base of the trail, where he carefully lays Amy down. Jeff crouches over
Amy, laying her arms across her chest, pushing the hair from her face.
He bends, kisses her blood- smeared forehead. Then he glances up at the
Mayans.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t even know her name. The Mayans just
stare at him. He rises to his feet, pulling the knife from his belt:
it’s darkly stained with. blood. JEFF You should. You should know who
you’re killing.</p>
<p><strong>say my fucking name!</strong>: Silence. The Mayans stand
there with their weapons raised, waiting to see what he might do. A
beat, then he starts walking once more, along the clearing’s edge, away
from Amy. Another ten yards and he stops again, waves up the hill. JEFF
There’s Stacy, too. And Eric. Mathias. And Henrich. You’ve killed them
all. He steps toward them. The bald man raises his hand, holds it up,
palm out, next to his pistol. Jeff smiles at him again. JEFF But not
everyone. He LAUGHS, a little wildly, and shakes his head. JEFF Look at
you, you stupid fucks. You have no idea what I’m saying, do you? He
takes another step into the clearing. The bald man COCKS his pistol,
loudly. Several of the other Mayans have emerged from the jungle; they
stand there watching.</p>
<p><strong>amy;</strong>: –and starts to run, straight at the Mayans. He
only manages three steps before the bald man FIRES his pistol, and the
others let their arrows fly. The bullet hits Jeff in the chest, just
beneath his throat. One of the arrows misses; the other three strike his
stomach, his left arm, his right thigh. Before he even hits the ground,
there’s a SHOUT from the Mayans along the treeline. The bald man turns.
Amy is on her feet, sprinting for the jungle. The bald man raises. his
pistol, FIRES, but the shot is too hurried; it goes wide. The others are
still scrambling for fresh arrows as she vanishes into the trees. The
bowmen sprint after her, disappearing into the jungle, leaving the bald
man alone in the clearing with Jeff. The Mayan women stand motionless
along the treeline, staring. after Amy: they look mortified,
grief-stricken. Jeff is bleeding heavily from his wounds, struggling to
crawl forward, his breath frothing pinkly at his lips. A half dozen
tendrils slither into the clearing. They coil around his legs, start to
drag him back toward the hill. Jeff fights them, kicking, MOANING,
bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>cut to a black screen</strong>: WE HEAR footsteps, moving
quickly down a tiled floor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: She flagged down a tour bus, just west of
Coba– The voice CARRIES OVER into:</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: –and collapsed before the driver even
managed to open the door. The corridor is brightly lit, very clean.
Rooms open off it on either side, and we glimpse the still.forms of
sleeping patients as we pass, IVs hanging from metal stands beside their
beds. It’s very quiet. DOCTOR She revived briefly, just after they
brought her in. She was in bad shape–severely dehydrated, traumatized,
in shock. And terribly frightened. It was impossible to make any sense
of what she was saying. She was sobbing, hysterical. We had to sedate
her. The doctor has a manila folder under his arm; he opens it, pulls
out a piece of paper: a color printout of a digital photo. He hands it
to Teresa. DOCTOR Her clothes were torn; she was covered in blood. But
not her own.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Now do you know?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: She has no wounds. A uniformed policeman
sits on a chair outside one of the rooms at the end of the corridor,
reading a newspaper. He rises as they approach. Teresa hands the
printout back to the doctor; she keeps the passport.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: That’s it? That’s all you have?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m afraid so. Be nods to the policeman, and
leads Teresa into:</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Has she stirred? The nurse shakes her head.
The doctor moves to the bed. He takes Amy’s wrist, feeling for
her-pulse. Amy’s eyes open at his touch. She stares at him, her arm
hanging limply in his grasp. He smiles down at her.</p>
