<p><strong>letty</strong>: Listen, Beast. What have I told you about
linen?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s liver saute.</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Goodness, this is a bad one. Tip your head
back.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch it.</p>
<p><strong>johansen</strong>: Well, I have a full calendar today, and
I’m afraid…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mr. Johansen, hello. I’m so sorry I’m late.
It’s very nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>principal gail</strong>: The Superintendent was just getting
ready to leave.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I do apologize. A student had a crisis.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. montes</strong>: A crisis, you say?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: A bloody nose…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: A bloody nose of epic proportions.</p>
<p><strong>johansen</strong>: OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes. Wow us.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No cherry drops, Jenny. Yes, hi. I’m calling
for Paul Lascher. Could you tell him it’s Letty? He can’t? Um, well,
tell him, tell him that they went for my math idea. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Not so rough, guys. Mom? Hi. You’ll never
guess what…I’ve got the best news. No, about work. How about dinner?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You’re in trouble, young lady. I know, Mom.
But it’s the only place I can call from. Can you tell Ruth about dinner?
Paul’s fine, just fine.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Got to go, Mom. The monsters call.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Letty was just getting ready to tell me
her good news.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Tell, tell.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on your
blouse?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: So, I got the district to approve my
after-school math program.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: How wonderful, darling. What does that
mean for you?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ll be running it three days a week,
and…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Will you get time off to do that?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Not now, but maybe later, if they like the
program.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What’s up with you?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Not a job, a promotion.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Mmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Ruth. Calling Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Just go ahead and tell us.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: There’s nothing to tell.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Are you sure, Dear?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: No, really. Tell me about the promotion.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Well, my theory is that people can really
enjoy math, but they lose interest…</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: I’m getting married.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’m so happy for you. It’s just
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: My goodness. A wedding. My goodness.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Tell us every detail.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You’ve only known Jake a few months.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Three and a week. Isn’t it great?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: My goodness. What about an engagement
party? We must start planning. Champagne. Girls, we need some
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So, another one bites the dust.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s not another one. It’s my sister. Aren’t
you happy for her?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s only known the guy a few months.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can I put these here for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: In there’s better. It’s kind of romantic,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I really think if you’re going to spend your
life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Believe me, I know your feelings on the
matter.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The receptionist said you called earlier about
something.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: My math program. The Superintendent said he’d
fund it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good going. I knew you could do it.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Huntley told me today that if I come through
on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and
Meg at the Saint Mark.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I mean tonight.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Actually, I need to review the deposition
questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh, ok. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But I thought if you don’t mind, you could
listen and see how I come across?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Sure. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Letty, please, I need your full attention.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m sorry about your turtle Bobby, but you
know we only have show-and- tell on Mondays. Today, we’re scheduled for
grammar.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: But my mom says I have to throw it away
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Don’t even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Class, why don’t you…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You guys pull out your verb sheets and review
them.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: She says she won’t even come if Dad brings
Monica.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom won’t miss your wedding. She’ll come
around. I promise she will.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few
wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they’ll be ours.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Maybe if we had them both to dinner or
something.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: You always throw the best dinner parties,
Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Please, Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you
crazy?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could
throw you an engagement party maybe.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to
my class, OK?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: And the party?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah, it’ll be fun.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Who can come up here and give me a sentence
with a “to be” verb in it?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Who was that girl?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Come on up, Zach.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Neater, Zach.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Zach, you know the line by the “a” has to
come straight down or it looks like an “o.”</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What’s wrong, Zach?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Try again, Zach. Like that.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I’m sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, it’s not OK. You’ll never get to college
on OK.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It has to be good, Zach. Do you understand
me?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m very, very sorry, Zach.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You know what, guys? Wednesday’s not a
grammar day. It’s a collage day. It’s a collage ON THE WALL day.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be in charge
of paste.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are you doing? You’re going to be
late.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m calling in sick.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t have a fever.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t feel like going to work today.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Won’t it be hard for them to get a substitute
this late?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But what about that math project?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Paul, I just can’t go. Is that OK with you or
am I committing some horrible crime?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Forget I asked.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m just…I’m so tired lately.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Maybe you ought to see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, it’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s just I’ve got those parent conferences,
and I’m supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping
for Ruth’s dress and that, that engagement dinner.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can get out of the dinner.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, I can’t. I’ve already convinced both Mom
and Dad to come.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on, Letty. It’ll get done.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of course it will. Remember the big talent
show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when
Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You just need to get more organized. L</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s make a list of the things you need to
do, OK?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anderson</strong>: So at home, we’ve started our own
little library for Chandra.</p>
<p><strong>mr. anderson</strong>: We thought it would be a good project
for her to set up her own card-catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anderson</strong>: But what I’m wondering is whether we
should also be spending more time on her computer skills at home. What
do you think?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anderson</strong>: And we trust your opinion. Chandra’s
always talking about Miss Mayer.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. anderson</strong>: Just the other day she came home and
told us about you taking care of her bloody nose.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anderson</strong>: And she went on and on about the
collage. That seems very inventive, Miss Mayer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. anderson</strong>: Miss Mayer?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What the fuck. It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: More coffee?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Danish?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No more bear claws left?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Oh, no thanks, I’m too excited to eat.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Where’s Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Where’s the old bag I sometimes call
Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: She said she’d be here at 10.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What do you think of this one?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’d have to see it on.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Have you been crying? Your eyes are all
puffy.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Things have been kind of stressful
lately.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: But everything’s OK?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah, everything’s under control.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What about the engagement party?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Everything’s ready for tomorrow night–except
the artillery.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake’s
really looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You better start trying on before the
vultures get all the good ones.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What about this one?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Truly.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Hi, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Look, Mom, I think I’ve found the dress.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: You look just wonderful, Ruthie. But I
really think you should try on a few more, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Has Paul heard about his promotion?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, not yet. But you know Paul. He’s sure to
get it.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: No more. I can’t stand to try on one more
dress.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Paul could pop the question at any
time.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom, please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Especially with a promotion in the
offing.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Do you think I should?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom? Mom? Ruth?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I think they went over to the next shop to
take a peek at shoes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I gather he’s late as usual.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Can I get you a glass of champagne?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Hi, Dad, Monica. I’m so glad you could
come.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom, this is Monica. Monica, my mother,
Martha.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Dad, Mother, you’ve met before, right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mayer</strong>: How’ve you been, Martha?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s mushroom-time, folks.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You can always call it, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: You must get your cooking skills from your
father, Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Ruth’s narrowed the dress hunt down to two,
Dad.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mayer</strong>: Tell me about them.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: One’s a silk…</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I remember how hard it was looking for my
dress. I must have been to 100 stores.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You know what I think we need? Martinis. How
about martinis to celebrate?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: That might be nice.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Puglia olives. Would I forget? A round of
martinis coming right up.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: How can I help?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I
need you to, what was it?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What about the souffle? Has that gone in?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kind of icy in there.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Thank God we have alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Letty?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let? L LETTY Olives Aux Herbes De Provence. I
got the wrong kind of olives.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What’s all the dreck?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Sage, rosemary… Les Herbes.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: It’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, no. They’ve got to be Puglia olives,
packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn’t overpower the
palate.</p>
<p><strong>letty/paul/ruth</strong>: You can’t leave them alone./Get
back in there./Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you think of those Lakers?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Can you loan me a 20?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sure. Why?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m going to the store.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think you’re overreacting.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Letty, dinner’s almost ready. The souffle…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ll be back before you can say souffle.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I can’t find martini olives. All you have are
black.</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: Aisle 2A.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Excuse me, Miss. I can’t reach the cat
food.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: And a turkey and giblets, too, please. She
does like her turkey.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: They’re not there. I need the ones from
Puglia.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: They’re the ones that are packed in brine,
but they don’t overpower the, you know, the palate.</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: Specialty foods. 7B.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Where are they? Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: What’s wrong, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I think you should go now.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I need my olives.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: It’s time to leave.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Call security. Where’s security,
please?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Fucking olives. Fucking, fucking olives.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Call police. Now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I know you’ve had a rough night, but I have
a few questions for you, Miss Mayer, or Letitia.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Do you mind if I call you Letitia?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Letty.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: First off, Letty, can you tell me where you
are?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I answered these questions last night.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I know this can be a real drag, but the
attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam
when a patient is admitted during the night.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Great. Now, Letty, I’d like you to remember
three items. I’m going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes.
They are chair, cup and ball. Did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: OK, let’s subtract 6 from a succession of
numbers starting with</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And 85 minus 6?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s OK. It’s not a pass-fail kind of
thing.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Chair, cup and ball.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Let me shift gears here a minute… Do you
ever hear voices that other people don’t hear or see things they
don’t?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What about patterns? Do you find yourself
checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over
again?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How about arranging your possessions in a
certain way?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes? Go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my
underwear.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How do you sort it–by lace and cotton?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: By color.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What if it’s got a pattern?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Is this really important? Because I don’t
think it’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: A while, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That must be really difficult.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: For now, why don’t you just take it easy
while I confer with my colleagues. A nurse should be in shortly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Hello, Letitia. I’m Dr. Emlee, and I have
some questions to ask you…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I did this already.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: It’s hospital policy…</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: I’m the only doctor making rounds this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Well, I don’t have hallucinations.
Honest.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: This doctor, was he tall, with dark
hair?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah, and a dimple.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: I’m afraid Lhe’s not a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Psychologist, therapist, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Patient.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What kind of place is this?</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: I apologize for the inconvenience, but I
must ask you some…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I want to see my mother immediately.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: We discourage family visits for the first
48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you’ve experienced.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t think you understand. I won’t
wait.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Dr. Stone’s evaluation from last night
indicates you’re experiencing a great deal of anxiety, probably related
to depression…</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: We need to talk about starting you on
drug therapy. Most depressive personalities benefit from a drug like
Prozac or maybe Zoloft…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m in for 5 for manic depressive.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’ll go with that as well.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: You two always bet manic depressive. Tell me
more about the guard she strangled.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, just hit in the head.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What about voices? Does she hear voices?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not that she admits to.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Is she a washer?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: How organized?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She arranges her underwear by color.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: All tapped out.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ll float you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What about you, Marie?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I’ll say major depression complicated by
obsessive compulsive disorder. And could I get my change in ones?</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Treatment schedules are posted on the
bulletin board. Dinner at 6, lights out at 10 and no fraternizing
between patients.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m really not that hungry.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Just eat whatever you want. This will
give you a chance to meet some people.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: It’s OK, Letty. I’ll be right here with
you.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: So I said to my publisher this afternoon, I
said, don’t you even–</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Hi, gang. I want to introduce you to
Letty. Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and Marie, and John and Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Just discussing my pesky publisher. May I
ask what you do when you’re not vacationing?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Let the poor girl get some food, for Heaven’s
sake.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: As you may have gathered, I’m a writer.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I don’t like to say novelist. That sounds a
little grandiose, but I am on my third novel and…</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas, but
we really should get some food…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Now I’m going to say that the card you
picked was the Ace of Spades.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Michael.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Michael, this is Letty. She just
arrived yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: We’ve met. I missed you during rounds this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: This doctor thing has got to stop.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’m here, Sweetheart. I’m here. It’s
going to be OK.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Oh, Letty, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so… They
didn’t have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don’t know how it
happened.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’ve talked to Doctor Emlee, and he
says…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m so glad to see you. You can’t believe the
people in here. They’ve got patients posing as doctors…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Everyone says it’s the best facility in
the area for this sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I just want to go home. Can we go home
now?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or
Paul.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He
thinks it’s safer for you to stay here for a while.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: But what about Beast? Who’ll…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Ruth’s already taken him home.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And my class. It’ll be hard to find a good
substitute. And what about my math program?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Paul said he’d call the school. And your
father thinks he’s convinced the guard not to press charges as long as
you get help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: For his injuries. I guess you…I guess he
got hit in the head.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I packed up some of your clothes, and I
can bring whatever else you need.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom, no, please don’t go. Please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’ll see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: As soon as Dr. Emlee says.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Four people bet OCD and clinical depression
so I split the pool.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, her diagnosis was no mystery.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Especially the OCD.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fuck, I mean, anyone who color- codes her
panties has big problems.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey there. They’re showing “Groundhog Day”
if you…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You took bets on my diagnosis?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s no big deal. We all compare.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Who do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t take it personally.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You have no right, no right to take the worst
thing that’s ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Stop acting like you’re someone special.
You’re just like the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m not the one who’s masquerading as a
doctor. I’m not the one who’s, who’s…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s schizophrenic.</p>
<p><strong>patients</strong>: Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, no, you’re perfectly sane. That’s why
you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>patients</strong>: Bravo./Encore./Re-match.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: I can’t stop thinking about the
things I did wrong when my daughter was little.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: And how’s that make you feel?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: I just feel like sleeping. All the
time.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hell’s bells, you can count me in on that. I
haven’t had enough Z’s since I ran those sleep disorder experiments at
Stanford back in the 70s.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We really miss doing things with you,
Mrs. Hallstrom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Maybe when I hit my manic phase
again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve noticed Letty doesn’t much like to do
things with us.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh, no. Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then why are you so defensive?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t think we need to sacrifice Letty to
pep up a slow session.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Maybe you’d like to share some of your
feelings about OCD or depression with us, Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Do we have to talk about this?</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: I think in the spirit of group therapy,
it’s beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: You never know, Letty, how the person
sitting next to you may be able to shed light on one of your
problems…</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: …by revealing something that’s going on
in his or her own life.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Looking for a romance?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What are you looking to read?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Anything interesting.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: But you’re checking it out.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ve already checked it out 17 times.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You keep the book. I’m looking for Emily
Dickinson.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, if you take the magic book, I’ll feel
like maybe you accept my apology and don’t hate me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I haven’t heard an apology.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m really sorry I hurt your feelings. I
got a little carried away. Can you ever forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mrs. Hallstrom, I’m pretty sure you could
use that.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Now, don’t you have a gin rummy,
Mrs. Hallstrom? Go ahead, now, just lay those cards down.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hot damn. Gin rummy. I told you so. You’re
three games up on me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s prettier here than I thought it would
be.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah, I guess it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: That’s a big question.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I hope it wasn’t something I did.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Something you did?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Of course not, no. Is that why you’re
here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think we need to talk about some things.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yes, I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This has been really difficult, this whole
thing.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Especially this last year.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Especially now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So, I’ve been thinking a lot…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think
it’s about time…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I know. We can’t just keep going through the
motions.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Exactly. It’s time to make decisions.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You don’t have to say anything else. I’ve
known for a while that this was coming.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just wish we’d done it sooner.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you’re
not really supposed to have jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Or be up past ten or fraternize with other
patients.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I hope you like it. It’s a Marquis cut, 1.5
carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more
classic in its lines. Letty?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s, it’s really nice, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, you’ve done a perfect job.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So, what do you say, Let?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sure. We’ll save the formal announcement for
when you’re out. I already told your mother. I hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So will you?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Of course. Yes. I will. I do.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You missed out on some great broccoli
florets at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I wasn’t hungry.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: John even managed to lob a load of mashed
potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom’s milk.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Finally. I was getting tired of watching him
try every night.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Was it bad news–the visit from Peter?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Paul.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: He asked me to marry him.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Very romantic setting.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It was romantic. He’s very romantic.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So are you engaged, or what?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What have you done with the ring?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s magic.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: This isn’t funny. Paul would kill me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Guess which hand.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Enough with the abracadabra.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Guess.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: The left one.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The fair maiden guesses incorrectly. Should
we give her one more try? The audience says one more try. What guess you
now?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Come on, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: With this ring, I thee…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Really, this isn’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: OK, OK, I’ll give it back.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: For a price.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Good God.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A small price.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I won’t do your portion of kitchen
cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And I’m not covering for you when you sneak
out to call Dominos.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Get serious.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Everything’s a joke with you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: The medicine’s still bothering me. It feels
like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: We’ll see about adjusting the dosage if
that doesn’t clear in the next How are other things going?</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: The question, Letty, is how are you
feeling?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I miss Beast a lot, too.</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Hark the Herald Angels sing…</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Sorry, sorry. Candy canes are out of
season.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Mrs. Hallstrom?</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Come on. Come with me,
Mrs. Hallstrom.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Hot boxers.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I can’t believe you finally gave me the
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Loaned you. And it’s only ’til you get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: That settles it. I’m never leaving.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: I can hardly wait ’til you’re free. Planning
the wedding without you has been a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You’re slowing.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether
we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Ecru.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: And then the gold scroll or the black
Romanesque print?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Do we have to talk wedding details?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Oh, no, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Of course. You’re right. Besides, we should be
talking about your engagement.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Tell me more about Beast beating up that
other cat.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What’s going on with you, Letty?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What’s his name, Letty?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I didn’t say…</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Lights out, Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: We’re supposed to be asleep.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: We’ll get caught.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No rounds for another three hours.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nervous? Scared? Worried you’re not fit for
a caper of epic proportions?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Rendezvous at the closet in 30.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Letty, you should be in bed.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: There’s a spider in my room.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s got a green dot on its back. I can’t go
to sleep with it watching me.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Sounds awful. I guess we better check
it out.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Extra large pepperoni and mushrooms. And
two cokes. Hillview Psychiatric Hospital on Glenfield. Off the Fourth
Street exit.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It had this red spot on its back.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Green spot.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mottled really. Green and red.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: I don’t know why you feel you have to
lie, Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Lie?</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: If you feel lonely, or need to talk,
all you have to do is say so.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: To talk? Well, OK, that might be good.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: I understand you just got engaged.
Maybe that’s where we should start.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m afraid I can’t let you take that in without
the proper invoice.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s a pizza.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All the same, rules are rules.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What I understand is how low morale gets when
you’re posted at a guard station all night, Val.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t mean to go on and on like this.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: It’s OK. It’s good to let it out.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: He was graduating from law school, and he
just assumed I was OK with dropping out. We never really talked about
it. But I know he was disappointed in me.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I mean I’m just not sure I want the same
things now that I did even a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Is that so wrong?</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: You can only do what feels best to you
now.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I guess so. I think that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You’ve been so great. I just feel a lot
clearer about things.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Yes, of course. Whenever you want.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Sorry I’m late…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How’s it look?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Shhh. They’re coming to the cubic
zirconium.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I like those sapphire earrings myself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Simulated sapphires. I bet my
daughter would love those, too.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Jesus…just get a room.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I couldn’t really say anything because of
that fraternizing rule.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Well, Letty, this does present a
liability issue for the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m a grown woman, Dr. Emlee. I can take care
of myself.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: What about Michael? Do you know the
extent of his…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I know Michael’s a schizophrenic, and
Mrs. Hallstrom’s manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of
psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of
grandeur.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Go ahead and put the guard back up,
Letty. But you need to know what you’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t need a lecture. I care about
Michael.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Then that’s even more reason to listen.
Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience
emotional disturbances that result in personality changes.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Look, I know he’s almost through with
treatment here. And, he’s on medication.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But
lots of patients stop taking them when they’re on their own because the
side effects are so harsh. And, Michael’s condition is often worsened by
periods of stress. He’s been in and out of…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t want to hear anymore.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: First you tell me to do what I want to, then
you tell me to stop.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: All I want you to do is think about
what’s best for you. Really think about it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A daisy for the lady.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: The lady knows this is a dandelion.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A rose is a rose.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Thanks. Where’ve you been all day?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m not allowed to see you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Really? Me too.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I had to sneak by the guards to get here.
They say you’re highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may
hold back my own recovery.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Wow. I’m bad news.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s my rap?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Schizophrenic recidivism marked by
hallucinations and paranoid delusions.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Really, though. My thoughts go haywire
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What are the delusions like?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Shocking, huh?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Sure. But I took out a whole grocery
store.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I wish I could have seen that.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m starting to think that everyone’s crazy
to some extent.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get
planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and
straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks
so they have to twist and bend to reach the light. But even though they
end up crooked, they’re still trees, just like the straight ones.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why in the world did you let me start
talking in metaphors? That’s no way for us to break up.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Break up? They wish.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: What is all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>delivery man</strong>: I just deliver it, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>delivery man</strong>: A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: I see. Can you wait a moment?</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: But how does that make you feel, John,
what Letty said about your hostility?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: I’m sorry, Doctor. I just need a moment
with Mrs. Hallstrom.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: They say she ordered…Mrs. Hallstrom,
did you order a bunch of stuff, because Federal Express…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: It’s here, everyone. Come along.
It’s here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Oh, fine, let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: For you, John. And, Letty. And,
Michael, I know you’ll love these.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Mrs. Hallstrom, you ordered all this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thomas got a crown and all I got was a lousy
bracelet?</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: You must have spent thousands of
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Mrs. Hallstrom, you can’t possibly afford
to pay for this. It must go back.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Why, no, Doctor. It can’t. Most of
it’s for my daughter, Lily. She’s coming to family day tomorrow…all the
way from Cleveland with my grandson. You can’t be taking away their
“Welcome to California” presents.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: It’s going back. We’ll contact the
company this afternoon. Take the jewelry off, please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: But I have to keep something for my
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Let’s go back to group, and discuss it
there. Back to group, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Increase her lithium to 600 milligrams,
three times a day. Oh, and Nurse, let’s see about canceling the
cable.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Your mother’s in the rec room,
Letty.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: It’s so good to see you, Sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You too, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: You’re looking good. A little thin, but
good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Thanks so much for doing this. Ruthie
and Jake are up to a million things. And I just can’t decide.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Which flowers did you order?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: We haven’t. I wanted to talk that over
with you, too.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table
cloths first anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I was thinking either the peach moire or
cream damask.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: This would complement the blue in the bride’s
maids’ dresses. Look.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: We aren’t allowed to wear jewelry in here,
Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Just think, pretty soon, we’ll be doing
all these wedding preparations for you. Of course, if that’s what you
still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy
here.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I haven’t had a crush since I was</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: When did you start smoking?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: The puckering, dear. It doesn’t seem so
now, but in time, it will cause wrinkles around the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: You know, your life isn’t about being in
a mental hospital.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I hear this Michael fellow is
schizophrenic.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom, please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Don’t forget that Paul’s a promising
young attorney who loves you very much…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I’ll dump
him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I’ll
do that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’m only looking out for you.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And if I want to smoke, I’ll fucking
smoke.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mrs. Mayer, I’m sorry but I couldn’t help
overhearing. I just wanted to say, not that it’s any of my business…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I think, really, I think I’d go with the
cream damask.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: It’s OK to be upset.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Upset? Why of course not. My
goodness, no. I’m sure she just got hung up.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mrs. Hallstrom, why don’t you join my
family for dinner. You’ll love my Grandma Rosa.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: That’s so sweet, Michael. But,
really, I’ve so many things to do.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: If you change your mind, we’ll be in the
dining hall.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: What do you need now? Send down the lamb. This
girl’s as thin as a stick.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh, no. I’m stuffed.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Tell her to eat, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>mr. santucci</strong>: Mangia. Mangia.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You can’t turn down Grandma Rosa’s
lamb.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Or my eggplant. I make the best eggplant in
L.A. The mozzarella I use, it’s so fresh it sweats.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santucci</strong>: Michael says you’re a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I was. I’m hoping I’ll still have a job when
I get out.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Rosa, Rosa, you must have this,
Rosa.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Grazie.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho, ho,
ho.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael, we’ve got to stop her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hallstrom</strong>: My goodness, it’s so very warm in
here. So warm.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You must have thought about it. Everyone
does.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I just want to see Beast. Where would you
go?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The mission up in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s where I always go when I get
out.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My dad used to take me there when I was
little. It’s totally quiet. And you can see the ocean for miles.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What else would you do?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’d like to drink a bottle of red wine with
you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And
we’d get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading
the paper.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And we’d eat Spaghetti-O’s in bed from the
can.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How can you even mention Spaghetti- O’s
after eating Grandma Rosa’s dinner tonight?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I have a terrible confession.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Tell the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t like lamb.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Then it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Lie down.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s a good thing my family loves you.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Your family just met me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re right. I guess I was projecting.
What I should have said is, “It’s a good thing I love you.”</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael, I…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s OK. You don’t have to say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: But I do. I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, right. I’m ready. How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and
to give you this for good luck.</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: Why have you petitioned to leave the
institution?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I haven’t had an episode in more than a month,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: How do you plan to support
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: Where will you live upon release?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Live?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: With my mother.</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: Is your mother here today?</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: The records indicate no major episodes
in the past four months. And it seems you have the support of the
staff.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: But I see you’ve been in and out of
the hospital more than ten times.</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: Do you feel ready to re-enter the
world?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes, Sir. My family is prepared to support
me until I find a job. They’ve already located an apartment for me
that’s very near them.</p>
<p><strong>judge milton</strong>: Very well, then. By order of the
court, you are released. I wish you good luck.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s so urgent? You’ve got me worried.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I need to tell you something, and I’m not
sure how.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can tell me anything. Do you want to
postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s a load off my mind.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t mean to hurt you. I know this is a
terrible thing. And I have really loved you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it’s
natural to be nervous. But we’re going to work through our problems.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ve met someone else.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It doesn’t matter who.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Have you been seeing another teacher?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s a doctor, isn’t it? That’s unethical.
I’ll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will
spin.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: He’s a patient here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of all the crazy things. I understood when you
dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I’ve tried to be
supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I love him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re going to throw away our life together
for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think
is love?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Here’s the ring.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No way. You keep the ring. You’ll come to your
senses.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You keep it, Letty. This is not over. Our life
is not over.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How’s it hanging, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Home free.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Letty, Michael, you have about five minutes
until visiting hours end.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Tell me all.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I was brilliant, or at least boringly
sane.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: So there were no problems?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not a one.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And did you go to the mission?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Just checking.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty
deed?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So, it’s over?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: All over. Did you see your new apartment?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Furnished?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, I need some serious household
advice.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: First off, you’ll need to go to Target. And,
let’s see, what should you buy?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I better make a list.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: List schmist. You’ll remember.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hit me.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’m over.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Dr. Stone will ask you some questions,
and then we’ll get you settled.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: Lights out in 15, Guys.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Wow, that first night is hard.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s going to be a difficult few weeks for
him.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It really does.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I’ll put in 5 that it’s a straight diagnosis
of depressive personality.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: But what I really can’t believe is that I’m
starting to actually miss work.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Have you been in contact with the
principal about your job?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I thought about calling, but I want to wait
until I know when I’ll be out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Then, you should call.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: I think it’s about that time, Letty. The
charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you
seem to be dealing with your life quite well.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Are you saying I’m through with therapy?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Must you walk so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s good exercise, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’m so thankful you’ll be leaving next
week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ve already made arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you’re not
allowed to mention Michael.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Not even if it’s something positive?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Have you spoken to Paul at all?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Honestly, Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: A deal’s a deal.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Have you heard the figure on how much
Queen Elizabeth’s going to pay in taxes this year?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I knew you had it in you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: So, we’ll meet every Tuesday and Friday.
And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: OK, good. That’s good. Thanks an awful lot
for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: It was just a little going-away
gesture.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I have a going-away gesture for you, too.</p>
<p><strong>dr. emlee</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ll miss you, Mrs. Hallstrom.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You know I will. Thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: See you later, guys.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Aren’t you supposed to throw a bouquet or
something?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Aren’t you ever quiet?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ve heard the mission in Santa Barbara is
the place to go.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This is it – 3B. Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Open up. I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: OK. Open them.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I love the pillows.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said
they’re the latest thing.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Very trendy. Let’s see the rest.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s TV heaven.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I was tired of watching what everyone else
wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Let’s try out the bed.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’ve got to see the kitchen first.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I love your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What do you say we go out to dinner to
celebrate?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Out? Are you kidding? I’ve got all the
fixings here.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: How can you not like the Top 10 List?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I like it. But Headlines are better.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You’re so wrong.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s sex time.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I think it’s my turn.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Letty? Rise and shine.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ll be forced to tickle you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How about this? It’s 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m supposed to meet the principal in half an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You, too. Kick ass today.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: My apartment tonight. You can meet Beast.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’ve got one hell of a great body.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Well, I understand. I know my behavior was
poor.</p>
<p><strong>principal gail</strong>: So, in light of how the parents
feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I
don’t think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Look, Gail, I’ve been a good teacher.</p>
<p><strong>principal gail</strong>: I know, Letty. But the incident with
Zach was frightening for the children. Now if you’d come to me,
explained what was going on…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Believe me, I wish I’d understood what was
going on. I’ve worked really hard to get better.</p>
<p><strong>principal gail</strong>: I’m glad you’re doing well.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ve already thought about how to tell the
kids where I was.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And I’d like to send the parents this letter
of explanation. With your support, I think they can accept me.</p>
<p><strong>principal gail</strong>: It’s a very nice letter. But I have
to go with what’s best for the students.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>principal gail</strong>: I need someone to work on budget
projections.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Office work?</p>
<p><strong>principal gail</strong>: Or, of course, you could take a
sabbatical the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smythe</strong>: It’s not that we’re doubting your
intelligence, Mr. Santucci. But your work history shows so many
interruptions.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I know, but as I said…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I can do the job.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smythe</strong>: Between you and me, my uncle, he has
some mental problems, and I know what you’re going through. If it were
up to me, I’d hire you.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This must be Beast.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: That’s Mr. Beast to you.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I bombed. It’s either work in the office or
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sounds grim.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Yeah. How was the job search?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Who ever said sanity was fun?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It doesn’t matter. It’ll work out.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Promise. As long as we have steak.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Steak?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: While I’m gone why don’t you slip into
something a little more naked?</p>
<p><strong>lady one</strong>: I can’t believe he did that.</p>
<p><strong>lady two</strong>: What a weirdo.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t ever talk about me again, you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The store was busy.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You got wine. That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Would you mind if we just called it an
early night?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You go ahead and relax. I’ll cook.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I think I should go home.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Big restaurant interview tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You know, we’ve got that dinner with my
parents tomorrow, too. I should really get some rest tonight.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: How’s filet sound?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, no, no. Not now. No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santucci</strong>: More water. It’s too pasty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ll never Mget the hang of this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santucci</strong>: All the Santucci women go through
this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. santucci</strong>: Hi there, Letty.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Hi, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>mr. santucci</strong>: It needs more water.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Maybe we should make lamb next week.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Four interviews. Four no-gos.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: The restaurant, too?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I couldn’t even face that one.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: That’s OK. We can call and reschedule in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You don’t have to take care of me, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santucci</strong>: Maybe we should save the job talk for
after dinner.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just promise you’ll love me even if I end
up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I think you know I’d love you even more in a
blue polyester cap.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You’re going to miss the Top Ten.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael, hurry.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I think I could get the program up and
running in the next two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: She’s worried that I’m unstable.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: But I wouldn’t push for the program if I
wasn’t ready.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’d have to do that, too. But I’ve gotten
better at pacing myself.</p>
<p><strong>johansen</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ll call you if I have problems. Scout’s
honor.</p>
<p><strong>johansen</strong>: I have to say I’m inclined to give it
another try.</p>
<p><strong>johansen</strong>: But, Letty, why don’t you give yourself
three weeks to set it up this time?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I got worried. Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Michael, the shop’s about to close.
Maybe you could try on your tux.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael just got a job. Couldn’t you
congratulate him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I will, Dear. I promise. Why
McDonald’s?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: He’s been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.
It’s not that easy after you’ve been locked away.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’ve read that lots of people my age are
supplementing their incomes these days by working at McDonald’s and
Burger King.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m going to take that as an honest effort at
being open minded.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Don’t be fresh.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Just remember that I love him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: I’ll say this, Dear. He looks damn good
in a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Aunt Lily is the one who married your
father’s cousin?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No, that’s Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who
looks like a hooker.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh. And, Harry, he’s the one who likes
magic?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: You don’t have to know all this by Saturday.
It took me years.</p>
<p><strong>aunt lily</strong>: What a beautiful wedding.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Aunt Lily?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mayer</strong>: Oh, and have you met Michael? He’s
Letty’s boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I don’t think people even noticed. I thought
the ceremony was perfect.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: That’s thanks to all your help.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Sorry to do this to you. But I am the
bride.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: I don’t think I’ve seen you in two or three
years.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: You were with that lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m dating Michael now.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Met him in the receiving line. What is it that
he does for a living?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Well, he just got a job… M MICHAEL</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Speak of the devil. How did you guys meet
again?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: At the psych hospital.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: That’s fine, Uncle Cort.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: So you were a volunteer over at the
hospital?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: When he could get time off from the
restaurant business.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How about a dance?</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: You two go ahead. I’m going to go bother that
pretty sister of yours for a dance.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Bye, Uncle Cort. What’s with the lie?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It wasn’t exactly a lie.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: People at weddings don’t want the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s not good to drink so much with the
medication you’re on.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mayer</strong>: It’s good to see you so happy.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Thanks, dad.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael? Michael? You should come to bed.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Did you take the aspirin and water? You don’t
want to feel awful in the morning. I’ll get you some.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What is it? Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Always the drugs.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I saw you talking to my Mom.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: We both talked to her, Michael. And your
dad.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What do you mean not taking your meds?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why’d you tell?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I didn’t talk to her about medications,
Michael. Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Silly? Silly am I?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Silly, silly, silly.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I think I should call someone.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t upset my Mom. Don’t you upset my
Mom.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael, calm down. Please. It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael, stop.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not my Mom. Not my silly silly Mom.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: 1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2. My
boyfriend’s out of control.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: What’s going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Please, please, send someone. No, he’s having
an attack. He’s schizophrenic…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m sorry, so sorry. I never should have
called.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: You did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I ruined your wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Did he hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: You don’t have to make any decisions
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: But what am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Do you want to go see him? I’ll take you if
you want to go.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I can’t. I can’t see him there.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I was so sure. I really thought it would
work. We have plans, Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m glad you agreed to see me.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m just glad there aren’t any hard
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, none. None. I completely understand what
was going on.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How’s work going? Are you back at school?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I start on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Getting back.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I heard about your friend.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I heard your friend was back in the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Michael. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Our relationship meant a lot to me, too,
Paul. But it’s over. And Michael being in the hospital doesn’t really
change things.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think I’ve heard this speech before.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve got a deposition that I really need to
get cracking on, so if you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Sure, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Wait. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I need to give you this.</p>
<p><strong>nurse gates</strong>: He’s in Jamie’s old room.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>letty/michael</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I guess we need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s hard to know where to start.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sorry. I’ll be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I sure know what that feels like.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: And all the plans we have.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, the plans.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’ve been thinking I could try to visit you
at night after work, and then there’d be more time on weekends to
see…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Letty, please.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Like I’ve told you before I don’t want you
taking care of me.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Someone has to take care of you right now,
Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your
medications.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But that wasn’t me. I didn’t mean to do
that.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Well then why’d it happen?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t fucking know.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t come here to blame
you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I didn’t mean for any of this to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Oh, God, Michael, I know. Why does everything
have to be so hard?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I know I don’t want to lose you. I don’t
think I could stand it.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: No. I can’t, Michael. I’m so sorry, but I
just can’t handle all this right now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I know. I can’t either.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I love you too, Letty. I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and
live on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s the best idea I’ve heard in a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Don’t you have a magic trick or something to
make this easier?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How about something better? Like a
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Would that really be such a good idea for
either of us?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Just promise me you’ll be OK, OK?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I will. And you make sure you take care of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Promise you won’t fall for any guys
pretending to be doctors.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I guess I should go now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You should go.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: First of all, I want to welcome you to
MathShop. I have lots of fun games planned for us. Let’s see, Bobby, can
you help me pass out these cards?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why were you gone so long?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My mom said you went crazy.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: I had what some people call a nervous
breakdown. I wasn’t dealing with life so well so I went…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: To a place for psychos.</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: To a psychiatric institution.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: It’s a place where you figure out what you
want, and what things in your life aren’t working. You learn to look out
for yourself and not get…</p>
<p><strong>letty</strong>: Let me show you the best thing I learned.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Wow./ Neat./ Do it again, Miss Mayer.</p>
