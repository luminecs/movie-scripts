<h1 id="affliction">affliction</h1>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: This is the story of my older brother’s
strange criminal behavior and disappearance. We who loved him no longer
speak of Wade. It’s as if he never existed. By telling his story like
this, as his brother, I separate myself from his family and those who
loved him. Everything of importance – that is, everything that gives
rise to the telling of this story – occurred during a single
deer-hunting season in a small town in upstate New Hampshire where Wade
was raised and so was I. One night something changed and my relation to
Wade’s story was different from what it had been since childhood. I mark
this change by Wade’s tone of voice during a phone call two nights after
Halloween. Something I had not heard before. Let us imagine that around
eight o’clock on Halloween Eve, speeding past Toby’s, Route 29, comes a
pale green eight-year-old Ford Fairlane with a police bubble on top. A
square-faced man wearing a trooper’s cap is driving the vehicle. Beside
him sits a child, a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her
face. The man is driving fast –</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn’t
help it it’s too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn’t help it I
had to stop at Penny’s for the costume. And you were hungry,
remember.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who’s fault is it then if it’s not yours?
You’re the one in charge, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating.
They’re still out.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Those are the Hoyts.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I don’t care. They’re out.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Can’t you see… look out there. Nobody’s got
their porch lights on anymore. It’s too late. Those Hoyt kids are just
out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox
there. They chopped down Herb Crane’s new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus
H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Why do they do that?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Break stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yeah. It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I guess they’re stupid.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Did you do that when you were a kid?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me
and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing
pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Was it funny?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: To us it was.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: But it’s not funny now.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’s not funny now. I’m a cop and I gotta
listen to all the complaints people make. I’m not a kid anymore. You
change.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I bet you did lots of bad things.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I just think you used to be bad.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No. I didn’t used to be bad. No sir. Where do
you get this stuff? From your mother?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No. She doesn’t talk about you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: We’re looking for the funniest costume!
And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of
all!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line.
Maybe you’ll win a prize.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still
know.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Why? Why not? You know these kids from when
you went to school here. It hasn’t been that long.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It’s not that.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What then?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I want to go home. I don’t like it here.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don’t mess this
up anymore than it’s already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do
that and before you know it you’ll be as happy as a goddamned clam.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Wade! And who’s that tiger? Is that Jill?
Come and join us.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What are you boys up to?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Same old shit.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: You see the damage these little sons- of
bitches been raising tonight?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You’re going to have to move your pickup.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Take a bite.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Don’t mind if I do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: LaRiviere’s having a hell of a time in there.
Master of fucking ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where’s that gun you were bragging on
today?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No brag. Just fact.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Got you for – 450, 500 bucks?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: See you got Jill tonight. How’d you manage
that?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Don’t forget to move your truck.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I
had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There
must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow?
See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No what?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No I didn’t see anybody I know. No I don’t
want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You are home. There are lots of kids you still
know here.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I don’t want to be here. Don’t worry, I love
you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow
morning, you still want to go home, I’ll drive you down. I’ll get off
work or something.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I called Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What? You called Mommy? Just now?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus, why?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I… because I want to go home. She said she’d
come and get me.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Come and get you! Shit! It’s a damn half hour
drive each way. Why didn’t you talk to me about it first?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: See, I knew you’d be mad.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, right, I’m mad. What’d you tell
her, for Christ sake?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don’t
be mad at me.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned
all this, you know. I mean, it’s sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You
shouldn’t have called your mother. C’mon, we’re gonna call her before
she leaves.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: She’s gone already! Gone already! Couldn’t
wait.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: That’s all you got to say? “Yes”.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: She won’t be here for a half hour. Think you
can stand it that long?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously
downstairs with the other kids isn’t good enough.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait
for her by yourself. That’s fine with me. Just dandy. I’m going
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That’s fine with me too. When Mommy comes,
tell her I’m up here.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I thought I told you to move that truck!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Relax, Chief. We’re leaving. You wanna
toke?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You gotta be more careful about that shit.
Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around
me they’ll expect me to bust you. And I’ll be outta a job.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Some job. Here, have a hit. Don’t be such a
hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody’s got problems.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, c’mon, then. Get in and we’ll take a
little ride, my man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Got a job first thing in the morning, first
day of season. Saturday I’ll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er
–</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Evan. He’s a mucky-muck union official from
Massachusetts. You’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t know about lucky. The guy’s a full-blown
asshole. Pay’s good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of
course. Which I can do. There’s some monster bucks hiding out up
there.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: How’d you get the job?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Gordon, he’s always got some angle working. He
wants to keep Twombley happy, I’m his boy.</p>
<p><strong>hettie</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Toothache. You should get close to him. Make
yourself irreplaceable. Guy’s loaded.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like you and Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Right. The sonofabitch couldn’t get along
without me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, he’d go broke tomorrow if you quit
him.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bastard’s got his high beams on.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>hettie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: My ex-wife Lillian and her husband. That was
them in the Audi that just passed us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Audi’s a good car.</p>
<p><strong>hettie</strong>: What’s she up here for?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Aw, shit, she’s here to get Jill. Me and Jill
had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move
this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before
they get there, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Piece of fucking cake.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Lillian!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Where’s Jill?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She
felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids
–</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Where is she now? Is she in the truck with
your friends?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: She told me she wanted to wait for you.
Inside.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: While you went off for a few beers with
your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: She’s grown up some, hasn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like
you’ve won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ’s
sake.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Horner! Leave her be. This’s got nothing to do
with you, so just act like the chauffeur. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>horner</strong>: Wade. Nobody wants any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I don’t want her to go, Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Don’t cause a scene. No one’s trying to win
any ‘rounds’. Don’t make it any worse.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m not making it any worse. You are. Me and
Jill could’ve worked this thing out. It’s normal, it’s even normal for
me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think
this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or
something?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Just wait till we’re through, goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Don’t you say a word. I didn’t hit him. I’m
not going to hit anybody.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: New hat? Jill’s up, I see.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: For a while.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Okay. She’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You two want to do anything tomorrow and
need a third party, give me a call, okay? I’m off.</p>
<p><strong>wickham</strong>: Like hell you are. Tomorrow’s first day of
deer season. I’ll need you at least in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Well, that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Take care, Wade.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You be careful of that little bastard. He’s
dying to get in your pants, you know.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Don’t worry. I can protect my virtue. I
mean, c’mon, Wade, give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: See you tomorrow, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Tomorrow, Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Watch this snow. It’s coming down
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin? Look, I was
wondering, with the snow and all, if you got school today? How the hell
do I know? You’re the principal. All I’m supposed to do is direct
traffic from 7:30 to 8:30. Yeah, okay, I’m sorry – I only just now saw
it was snowing, that’s all. My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow all
day. If I don’t get over to LaRiviere’s early enough, I’m stuck with the
grader. I was just hoping you’d have called school off. You check the
weather bureau? Okay, I hear you. I’ll be over in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: It’s not enough snow, not for tracking the
bastards. No advantage there, kid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those
suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We’ll kill us
a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Guaranteed, eh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in
the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we’re right behind
the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o’clock. Whether it kills a
deer or not is more less up to you. I’ll put you inside 30, 35 yards of
a buck the first four hours of the season. That’s what you’re paying me
for, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Damn straight!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Done much shooting with that rifle yet?</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Tell you what. You get me close to a big
buck by ten, kid, there’s another hundred bucks in it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you get it?</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You might not kill it.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: You think so.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for
somebody else to find and tag. Can’t guarantee that won’t happen,
especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: You take care of your end, kid, I’ll take
care of mine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: You understand what I’m saying? I want a
deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I get it. No sweat. You’ll get yourself a deer
and you’ll get him dead. And you’ll have him by coffee time.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: And you’ll get your extra hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>lugene</strong>: Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were
you holding everyone up?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He
could’ve killed somebody.</p>
<p><strong>lugene</strong>: Did you get his number?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know who it is.</p>
<p><strong>lugene</strong>: Good. Who?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Mel Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>lugene</strong>: I still don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: From Boston. Evan Twombley’s son-in- law – he
was driving. I know where they’re headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old
man’s out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big
weekend party planned.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Safety on?</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Follow close. We’ll cross the next meadow.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I used to play ball.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Drafted by the Red Sox.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: You played for the Sox?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Double A. New Britain.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pitcher. “Best ballplayer to come out of New
Hampshire since Carlton Fisk.”</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They said.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The only difference between me and that
Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast.
Why’d it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it
had to be somebody’s fucking arm.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Hey, Hewitt! Slow the fuck down!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Safety on?</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: Sun’s gettin high.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Deers have ears too.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Told you the snow was coming down. Take
the grader.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where’s the plow?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Jimmy took it. Jack’s out hunting with
Evan Twombley.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: His son-in-law damn near killed me.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda
hurt some kids. I’m gonna bust his ass.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Don’t go playing policeman.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What am I – a security guard? You hired me,
you and your Selectman friends.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: You don’t want the extra police pay?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m not saying that.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby’s.
Don’t let Lillian get to you. She didn’t belong here. That’s why she
left.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: That’s what I love about a small town.
You know everybody.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stay here, stand where I am.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here’s your
buck, Mr. Twombley. I’ll circle around.</p>
<p><strong>twombley</strong>: You only got a little while if you want
your hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How’s it goin?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Cold. How you think?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sorry about that. Why’s it every year, come
first snow, you get stuck with the grader?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: School. Traffic crossing. I gotta quit these
things.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What we doing after? Wells? Don’t work too
fast. Business the way it is, Gordon’s probably looking to lay me off
earlier than usual this year. He’s got too much money as it is. Why’s it
always the little guy that gets kicked in the butt in hard times?</p>
<p><strong>lacoy</strong>: …That was no pisser. I’ll tell you who was a
pisser. Glen Whitehouse. There was a real pisser. He was mean normal,
but when he drank it was like he burst on fire. Canadian Club. Always
drank CC. One Christmas there’s this cord of wood out back he forgot
about and he decides to have his two boys stack it. Except it’s been out
back two months and it’s snowed and rained and froze so now the wood’s
all iced in. He takes the boys. He was drunk, of course.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Move it! Daylight in the swamps!</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Pop, the kids are waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Rolfe.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: A lesson in work and its rewards. You’ll thank
me for this one day. Sally, turn off that TV!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Atta-go.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Please, Pop. Let’s go back.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: What are you, a quitter?</p>
<p><strong>long-haired local</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>lacoy</strong>: Beats me. That’s all I heard. Wade would know
more about it. Wade! We were just talking about your Old Man. “What are
you, a quitter!”</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better to do
than sit around and tell stories. Pity is, some college student will
come some day and believe this shit cause you’re the only one dumb
enough to talk to him. Take care.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: That was some job.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: We’ll work at it everyday, promise.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I think we made the point.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You just needed a drink.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: What was that? You got something to say, say
it! Say it!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You no-good pup!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It don’t look right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: The sign. It looks like it’s spelled wrong or
something.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It’s people like you
that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to
improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m not finding fault. It’s a good idea, good
for you, good for the town. Real modern too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This town sucks.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Aw, c’mon, I was only saying there’s something
wrong with “Home Made Cooking”, that’s all. The sign’s fine. What it
says is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Who needs it? Everybody who comes here has
been coming for years so what they need a sign for?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I’m sorry about what I said.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Said what?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: About you and Jill and needing a third
person. She went back to Lillian?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m going to start one of those custody suits.
I don’t give a fucking shit. You know?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You don’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. I mean that.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: No you don’t. You’re pissed, that’s all. You
ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You
know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian’s not out to
get you.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: The hell she isn’t. Lillian’s been trying to
nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I’m gonna hire me a fucking
lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged.
I’ve been thinking about it a lot. It’s like she owns Jill or something.
Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Marg!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill
off and leave me alone like this. I’m more than pissed, Margie. I’m a
whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the
difference. This is different.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Marg! You got orders!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Tonight. Let’s get together.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You talked to Jack?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Not since last night. He took a guy
hunting.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That’s what
it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The other guy.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where… how’d you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the
way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured
you’d know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This
Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No, I… I’ve been out on the grader all
morning. Twombley’s summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon’s. It
was his idea for Jack to take him hunting. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He don’t care for you.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Stop being jealous.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: What’s the hurry?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I figured you already heard.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I
got to get up there. How would I know? C’mon, you drive. We’ll take my
truck.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was
there was some kinda accident?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Twombley’s shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He’s
okay, I assume.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Fuck. You don’t know how bad or
anything?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You mean Twombley?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that
cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He more than likely just shot himself in the
foot or something. That’s what usually happens.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I wish you had. I’d rather be deer hunting
instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: You ain’t the hunter Jack is. And he
can’t drive the grader worth shit.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Like hell.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: That must’ve been Twombley. Jesus. I bet
that was Twombley.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You want me to follow them to Littleton?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Let’s get to the top and talk to Jack
first. He’ll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been
avoided, I’ll put that kid’s ass in a sling.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You heard the news.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: I hear Twombley got shot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Watch the dog, Wade. Takes a mind to, he’ll
tear your fucking head off.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Bad?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Thirty-thirty at close range.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Will he make it?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open. Had a hole
in back you could put your head into. Pretty big hole in front too. You
could’ve put your fist into that one.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: You see it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nope. Heard it. We wasn’t far apart. I spotted
this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked
over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was,
deader’n shit. Called it right in.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: This is gonna be one fucking mess to
clean up. Twombley’s son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn’t
you say you’d seen him, Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I seen ’em. Near ran me over.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You wanna tell ’em, Gordon? You knew the old
man.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: What the fuck. My day’s already ruined.
Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of
plowing to do.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It ain’t done, if that’s what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Something bugging you?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. A few things.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Well, right now we’re not too interested.
Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own
time.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Might as well take the rest of the day
off. You look sort of fucked up. You’ve been paid for the day, anyhow,
right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: You’ll get your money. Don’t talk to any
newspapers about this. Twombley’s a big deal down in Massachusetts, you
know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn’t comment.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Lawyer? I don’t need no lawyer, do</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: No, of course not. Just say it, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where’d Twombley get shot?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: In the chest.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No, I mean whereabouts.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A half mile in, along the old lumber road.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You bring him up yourself? That’s a steep
climb.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The ambulance guys lugged him up.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You stayed away?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where’d you get the blood?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What blood?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: On your sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Musta… How’d I know? What’re you doing,
playing cop?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was
just wondering, that’s all. What’d he do, to shoot himself, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or
something. I just heard the gun go off.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I never seen a man shot before. Not even in
the service. Must be something.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I didn’t actually see him do it. Like I
said.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Sure you did.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Saw him do it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never
seen the guy get shot, I told you that.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You musta seen him get shot. I know you
did.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s get the fuck outta here. You’re not
making any sense, man.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: There’s your old twenty-gauge, and that
there’s the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be
Twombley’s gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time.
It’s a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you
deserve it. Right’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Twombley sure as hell won’t be shooting it
again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He sure as hell won’t.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Rolfe.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause – has
there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy
named Twombley, Evan Twombley?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: There was something. It happened up your
way.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, I know him – the kid that was with him.
Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He’s my
best friend.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Wade, it’s late. I know you’re probably at
Toby’s, but I’m in bed reading. We got different habits.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No, not tonight. I’m in bed too. I’m calling
because I need you to listen. You’re supposed to be a smart guy. You’re
a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn’t see Twombley shot
but he did.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’ll come out Jack lied and the kid’ll get
hung for it.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: He was scheduled to testify for a committee
investigating organized crime in New England and the construction
business.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Twombley.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: You think Jack shot him?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, it was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: They were out deer hunting, right? Jack
probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Lillian was here. In Lawford.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: The night before the shooting.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: How was she?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for
the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer.
Maybe you can help me.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know,
’cause of Jill.</p>
<p><strong>timecut</strong>: mobile homes.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Don’t think about it. You’re exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days,
Rolfe, and some night I’m going to bite back. I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Haven’t you already done a bit of that?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No, no, I haven’t. Not really. I’ve growled a
little, but I haven’t bit.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gordon</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I was… I’m Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering,
is your husband here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gordon</strong>: He’s asleep. We were up very late.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, yes, I’m… I want to say that I’m real
sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gordon</strong>: Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a
little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I’m the local police
officer.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gordon</strong>: Something about my father?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Oh, no. No, it’s a… it’s a traffic thing. No
big deal.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gordon</strong>: Can’t it wait, then?</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: I said, ‘Next time, phone ahead.’</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the
way to serve somebody a summons, I don’t call ahead for an
appointment.</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m issuing you a ticket. Moving
violation.</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: Moving violation! I just got out of bed
and you’re telling me you’re giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now?
Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You’re nuts?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school
bus, which was flashing its lights, then you–</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Don’t ever put your hands on me,
Mr. Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: You’re talking about a goddamned ticket,
from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up
traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Don’t give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I’m
just –</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch
television too.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yes. Here’s your ticket.</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: You get the hell out of my house now,
asshole. And know this – you are going to be a lucky asshole if I
haven’t got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone
call, and I’m pissed enough to do it now!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Jack’s sort of sensitive, I guess. More than
most. But he’ll be okay in a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: There’s something funny about that shooting.
There’s lots funny about it, actually.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I heard he was drunk at Toby’s last night
and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m sure, I’m positive it didn’t happen the
way Jack says it did.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: …Jack’s turned into one of those men who are
permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it’s like, when he
found out he couldn’t play ball anymore, he changed. Now he’s like
everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’ve been wondering if maybe Jack shot
Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I’ve been wondering
maybe Jack shot him on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Wade! How can you even think such a thing?
Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Jack doesn’t need money.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Everybody needs money. Except guys like
Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Jack wouldn’t kill for it. Besides, who
would pay him?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston
union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The
Government’s been investigating his links with the Mafia.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No, I just know Jack’s lying about what
happened. He just seemed – I know that kid, what he’s like inside. He’s
a lot like I was at his age.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You wouldn’t have done anything like that,
shot someone for money.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No. Not for money. But, if somebody’d given me
half a damned excuse – I was pretty fucked up, you know.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: But not now.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: When you gonna get that tooth fixed?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I can see what you looked like as a kid.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You knew me as a kid.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not
really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to
see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: What way?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: After making love. I like it. It’s nice to see
that in a grown-up person.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Don’t you think, do you still think it’s a
good idea to press this custody thing – just now?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m her father – supposed to be, but I’m not
able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I’ve been
so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Then… I guess you have to.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: There’s another thing I’ve been thinking
about. I don’t know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we’ve
never talked about it. But I’ve been thinking lately, I’ve been thinking
we should get married sometime. You and me.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Oh, Wade.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’ve been thinking about it, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You’ve been married twice –</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It was to the same woman. I was just a kid…
It’s not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something
for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Alright. I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I’ve got sons, Goddamnit, oh my God, have I got
sons! Wade? Rolfe? Elbourne? You love me boys? Do you love your Pop? Of
course you do!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Glen, stop –</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Oh, Jesus, Sally, you are such a Goddamned good
person! Capital G. You are so much better than I am, I who am no good at
all, you who are a truly good person, like a fucking saint! Beyond
fucking com-pare.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: My big boy bursting out of the seams of his
jeans!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You little prick!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Glen, stop!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Did you tell them? That we were coming?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Don’t you think it’s proper for a fella to
introduce his girl to his parents?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I know your parents.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For
the lawyer. It won’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Are you sure they’re home? Did you call?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: The truck’s here. Looks like they’ve stayed
inside since the snow started.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Strange.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Think they’re alright?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Of course! I would’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I don’t know for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Pop, Pop, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold,
dressed like that? Where’s Ma?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You remember Margie Fogg?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: From Wickham’s. Been a while. Like some
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: How you and Ma doing? Haven’t seen you in town
for a while.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: We’re alright. Your Ma’s sleeping. You want me
to get her?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus. Nothing’s changed around here.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where’s Ma?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: She’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Have you been heating the house? Not just
with the stove.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: There’s a furnace.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You’re not using it today?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: It’s broke I guess. There’s an electric in the
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your
pipes’ll freeze. Wade, would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Ma? It’s Wade. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Oh, Lord.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Coffee’s perked.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: When did she die?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Is…? She’s dead then?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I checked on her. She had the electric heater.
Cold don’t bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the
heater.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Is there something wrong with the phone?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: In the living room.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Why didn’t you call and have the furnace
fixed?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this
morning she was.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: It makes me sad.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Can –?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I
shoulda froze.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Wade called me, as usual, late at night. I
knew it was Wade – no one else calls me at that hour – and I was ready
to listen to another chapter in one of his ongoing sagas. There was the
detective story concerning the shooting of Evan Twombley and the family
melodrama about Wade’s custody fight with Lillian. But not this
time.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Wade was telling a different story, or so it
seemed then, one in which I myself was a character. He had called to
tell me that sometime the previous night our mother had died, and he had
discovered the body when he’d gone over to visit her and our father with
Margie Fogg. Pop was okay, but kind of out of it. Worse than usual,
maybe, though no drunker than usual.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Shouldn’t we get this show on the road, now
that Rolfe’s here?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Pointless to stand around in church with
nothing to do, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: They’ll be at the church and the
cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Anyone else want one? Rolfe?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: No thanks. I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: How you holding up, Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m fine, fine.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: You Rolfe? I remember you from high
school. You’re a teacher now? Harvard?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: I haven’t seen you around. I don’t
suppose there’s much reason for you to come this way.</p>
<p><strong>rev. doughty</strong>: Come, Glen, join us. Let’s kneel for a
moment of prayer before the service. Wade? Rolfe?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: This is nuts.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Wade.</p>
<p><strong>rev. doughty</strong>: Dear Heavenly Father, Lord of Hosts,
we come to Thee to beseech Thy blessings and commend to You the soul of
our beloved wife and mother, Sally Whitehouse, to be one with You and
walk with You –</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: …goddamned hair on her head.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Not a one of you is worth a goddamned hair on
that good woman’s head!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Pop! Don’t do this now, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Maybe I’ll head on over to the
church.</p>
<p><strong>rev. doughty</strong>: This is a difficult time.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Listen, it’s no big deal, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Come on, smart guy. Tell how it’s no big deal.
Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>rev. doughty</strong>: Give up this demon.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Go fuck yourself!</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Wade, just leave it.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Listen to your little brother. ‘Wade, just
leave it.’ Candy-asses. All of you. That’s what I’ve got for children.
Candyasses. ‘Wade, just leave it.’ Praise the Lord! ‘Just leave it!’</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: If you ever touch her again, I’ll kill you. I
swear it.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: The day of the funeral was almost springlike.
The snowline crossed New Hampshire west to east, retreating northward to
Concord where it melted by midmorning.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m glad you’re here. Can you stay for a
while?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You ever come to your father’s grave
anymore?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: No, not anymore. It’s too… it’s too
far.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: We should talk.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: We’ve done all our talking, Wade.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Let the past be. I’m sorry about your
mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer.
It’s like they live their lives with the sound turned off – and then
they’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: She has an ice-skating lesson at four.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’m taking ice-skating, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Let’s dig out Pop’s truck before the skin of
the snow freezes up.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: What about Margie?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Well, do you still plan to get married?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. She’ll probably quit her job and stay
out here with Pop. We can’t leave him alone here, he’ll set the damn
place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it’ll be good to have Margie
around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got
a custody lawyer in Concord. I’m gonna see him tomorrow. All hell’s
gonna break loose, but it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I want to let the gas run out. I don’t want
the bastard driving drunk, and he’s always drunk now. After, we’ll hide
the keys.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Anything new about the shooting?
Twombley?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I guess it was an accident, like everybody
thinks.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Want to know what I think happened?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Find them everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: I think your first response to the Twombley
shooting was the correct one.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: That it wasn’t an accident.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Then who shot him?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Motive. You gotta have a motive.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Who’d pay him that kind of money? Not the mob.
They got their own guys. Specialists.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: They wouldn’t deal with a guy like Jack. Who
else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I don’t know. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Okay. It’s likely there are people in the
union who don’t want Twombley to testify. They probably include his
son-in-law who’s vice-president and will probably be the next president.
I read that in the papers. What’s his name, Mel Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I
did, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Here’s my theory. Twombley, unaware of
illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the
investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: So Mel Gordon wouldn’t want a professional
hit. That’d make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: A hunting accident is perfect.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the
woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your
hunting license lifted. Jack’s probably saying the guy shot himself
cause he ain’t got his deer yet and don’t want his license pulled.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’s too neat. Things ain’t that neat. It
makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own
father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don’t that piss you off?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Right’s right, goddamnit! Don’t you care
what’s right?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: I care about what happened. The truth. I’m a
student of history, remember?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: I was thinking about that story you told me,
about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: I hate to disappoint you, but I don’t think
it happened.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Of course it happened. Why would I lie about
it?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: It may have happened, but not the way you
said.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You think I wouldn’t remember a thing like
that?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: It wasn’t me. I wasn’t there, but I heard
about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: We’d have to go digging in Vietnam to ask
him.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor
and told him you fell from the hay loft.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, I never heard that one.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: I remember clearly cause when I heard I
became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a
careful adult, but at least I wasn’t afflicted by that man’s
violence.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: That’s what you think.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: I gotta head back. It’s a long drive.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Put out that fucking cigarette!</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Not there, asshole. Flush it!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Morning, Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m fucking out of here.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Lawford?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Out of this fucking job. This job sucks.
Working outside in the winter sucks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Open the door, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Why don’t you quit now, you want out so
bad?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Open the door. We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I mean it – you got enough money now. Head out
for California. Surf’s up, Jack, and you’re digging wells in the
snow.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you mean I got money? I’m as broke as
you.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Looney Tunes, Jack. Fucking Looney Tunes!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Mr. Gordon!</p>
<p><strong>mel gordon</strong>: The boss in?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes indeedy!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with
everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good
father.</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: It would help if you were married, if there
was someone at home while you work.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I plan to. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: How soon?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: This spring.</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: Good. It would help if there were some drug or
alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to
the child.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It looks pretty hopeless, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: No, not exactly. I’ll look at the divorce
decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill,
right?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: Fine. I’ll need a $500 retainer. You can mail
it.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus. How much… how much will the whole thing
cost?</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: Hard to say. If we go for custody,
depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve
thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the
visitation rights redrawn, assuming they’re unduly restrictive, it
wouldn’t be more than twenty-five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: You might be better off legally as well as
financially to just go for the –</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just
my getting back at her. I’m not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I
love my daughter. I’ll send you the five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going
out again.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: You ever think of getting a new car,
Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: On what you pay me?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him
pick up Wade’s car, fix the clutch.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Use the pickup. I’ll bill it to the town.
You’re the town police officer and the town police officer should have a
decent car. You want a new car or not?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What do I have to do for it?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Nothing, Wade, I’ve been thinking. You
don’t get enough appreciation around here and it’s time we changed
things a little.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He say anything about the summons I tried to
give him? Sonofabitch wouldn’t accept it.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Wade, that wasn’t smart. Going out right
after the man’s father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor
to me.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You? Why?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Mel’s doing some business with me. It’s
nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No
big deal.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: That was before Twombley was shot. Before he
knew.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: What’s the difference? Take my truck,
take a rest – stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to
do with your old man’s place – he going to stay there?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Want to buy?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Don’t light that in here. I’m
allergic.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I won’t. You interested?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You and Mel Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Always count on old Wade for a good screwing.
Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all
the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Out! Out!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You crazy sonofabitch! You’ll sink us both!
Get off the fucking ice! Get off!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll shoot you, Wade, I swear it! I’ll fucking
shoot you dead if you don’t move away from that truck!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t move! I’ll shoot you dead if you
move!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your father’s in back, Wade. Marg had to
babysit him. She moved in with you, huh? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Ah, the prodigal son.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: About fucking time.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Look, got me a new job, second cook and bottle
washer!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jesus Christ, Pop, let’s go home. I got
waylaid. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: The fuck you got waylaid. You follow your prick
around like it was your nose.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can it, Whitehouse. Get him out of here. It
was funny at first, but I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: There’s clothes in the back.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Let’s go home? What home is that? Your home? My
home? Let’s have a talk about that. You’re fucking sly, Wade. Your
mother’s dead so she can’t make any excuses for you anymore! You gotta
deal with me! No more sugar tit, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Pop, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You think you can take me now? Come on,
try.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Marg, get out of this. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I wish you would die.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No shit, Rolfe, I glanced up and there he was,
only it was me. But it was like I had never seen myself before. It was a
stranger’s face. Hard to explain. You fly on automatic pilot, like I was
doing all night, and you disappear.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Then you accidentally see your body, or your
face, or whatever, and you don’t know who the hell it belongs to.
Strange. It’s the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly
pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the
Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie’s being so
upset – one thing on top of another.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Wade, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: But you gotta hear this. You won’t believe it.
Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I’m in his
office.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: He’s on to us!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit! What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to
Mel.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can’t buy Wade off.</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: We bought you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That was me.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Wade! Come in! Have a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You got yourself a computer, Alma.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Been putting my files into it. You take sugar
and milk?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No. Black.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Are you alright, Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I
got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Well, you look… sad. Upset. I don’t mean to
pry. I’m sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Alma, I think there’s some dirty business
going on in this town.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Always has been.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: This is maybe worse than you and I are used
to. What I’m talking about, I’m talking about murder. Among other
things.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot.
Somebody murdered him.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: …if Jack told the truth, he could be free by
the time he’s my age.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Sometimes things are simpler than you think.
Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You don’t believe me?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax
bill on your father’s farm lately?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know he’s due for the last two years. I was
thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Has anybody offered to buy it?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: This is all the real estate transactions in
this town the last year. Most of it unused land. Most of it for little
more than the back taxes owed.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: This is from three years ago. Some difference,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What is the Northcountry Development
Association?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: I went down to Concord to check it out. The
president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon
LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this
year. I believe that’s out of LaRiviere’s league.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Twombley involved?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He musta found out. They had to get rid of
him. And Jack’ll get blamed.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere
is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a
year or two, you won’t recognize this town.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You sneaky sonofabitch! I’ve got your number
now, Gordon! All these years I actually thought you were a decent man.
Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: Wade, you’re done. Let me have the shop
keys.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You two, don’t you get it? He’s using you.
You’re his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>lariviere</strong>: The key, Wade.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, you can have the key. It’s the key
that’s kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with
pleasure. Now I’m free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is
give back what the man gave you, and you’re free of him. I’ve got to
call my brother.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know what it means. I’m just running out of
ways to use it.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: To help, Jack, of course – and to nail those
sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That’s what Alma calls them. Jesus,
Rolfe, whose side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Take care of the little things first, the
things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call
Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God’s sake, and get
your tooth pulled, don’t trust the locals, get your facts straight and
go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: The good news is we haven’t got to your car
yet. The bad news –</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Just tell me when you’ll have it fixed.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: – the bad news is there’s a problem with
Gordon’s truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured
you’d know something about that, Wade.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. I know about that.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: LaRiviere says he ain’t gonna pay for the
fixin’ of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad
news. Wanna hear it?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Chub says you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He can’t fire me. LaRiviere already did that
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: He’s a Selectman. The town. He said to tell
you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I’m supposed to
pull the CB and police light out of your car. They’re town property.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What do you mean, you can’t take me today? I
told you –</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: What on earth is happening to you? Why are
you acting this way?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’s my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can’t even
think anymore because of it.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I heard you talking. You got fired this
morning, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Look, that’s temporary, believe me. There’s so
much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by
LaRiviere and Merritt won’t matter a bit.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’ll get another job. People are going to need
me. After this is over, they’ll make me into a Goddamned hero. You wait:
you’ll see, I’ll deliver. I’ll be the best father who ever lived. You
need me, even Pop, for Christ’s sake, he needs me. This town needs me.
Maybe now they think they can send me howling into a corner like a
kicked dog, but my God, it’ll be different soon.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Leave the bottle out!</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: You will say I should have known terrible
things were about to happen, and perhaps I should have. But even so,
what could I have done by then? Wade never went inside. He lived almost
wholly out there on his skin, with no interior space to retreat to, even
in a crisis.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Wait there. She’ll be right out. Is there
snow on the ground up in Lawford?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah, lots.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: See. Get your boots.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Hi honey.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Have her back tomorrow night by six.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No problem. Look, I…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You make me sick. I can’t believe you’ve
sunk so low.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Low as what? What have I done? It’s bad to
want to see your own daughter?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You know what I’m talking about. For what
you’re doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You
won’t get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Bye, honey! Call me tonight if you
want.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Are we going in this?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. My car’s in the shop. This’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It’s pretty old.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It belongs to Pop.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Pop?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Grandpa. My father. It’s his.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: How about a Big Mac?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Mommy won’t let me eat fast food. You know
that. It’s bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: C’mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a
cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What do you want, then?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You can’t have nothing, Jill. We need lunch.
Mr. Pizza?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says –</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know what Mommy says. I’m in charge today,
though.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Okay. So we’ll get what you want. What do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we
get home. Maybe we’ll stop by Wickham’s for a hamburger when we get to
Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham’s.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Oh, Jesus, Jill, I’m sorry. What’s the matter,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Please don’t cry. Please, honey.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What are you sorry for?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I don’t know. For the food business. I guess.
I just thought, you know, we’d sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used
to.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That’s illegal, you know.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You’re a policeman.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Nope. Not anymore. I’m nothing anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jillie, you want a cheese grilled
sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s called a grilled cheese sandwich, you
dub.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jill, please, it’s alright. Nothing
happened.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Okay, let’s go home, then.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wade, I got a message for you. Jack Hewitt,
he’s looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in
Town Hall.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: His office. You mean my old office.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, I guess – that’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He got his deer yet?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, he’s out now. Somewhere on the mountain.
I’d stay away from him if I were you. He’s real pissed.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Going somewhere, Margie?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I’m just cleaning out some of this stuff
that’s built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners.
And the laundromat.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Don’t lie to me. You’re leaving me, I can see
that.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Don’t be silly. Hi, Jill.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Marg.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Leave me alone! Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Leave her alone! Leave her alone!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I want to go home. Will you take me home?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You! By Christ, you – I know you. Yeah, you
goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You’re a goddamn fucking piece of my
heart!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You don’t know me. You don’t know me! So fuck
you. Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it!
Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Love! What the fuck do you know about
love?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Love! I’m made of love!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Call it what you want.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Everything you know is from me.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Bang!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You and me.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch,
you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need… Give me the Goddamn
keys! I need to get me to town!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Crawl!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a
fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck – stolen!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I don’t know you. My goddamn father and I
don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know you now. I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Joke. You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: The historical facts are known by everyone –
all of Lawford, all of New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts. Facts do
not make history. Our stories, Wade’s and mine, describe the lives of
boys and men for thousands of years, boys who were beaten by their
fathers, whose capacity for love and trust was crippled almost at birth
and whose best hope, if any, for connection with other human beings lay
in an elegiac detachment, as if life were over.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: It’s how we keep from destroying in turn our
own children and terrorizing the women who have the misfortune to love
us; how we absent ourselves from the tradition of male violence; how we
decline the seduction of revenge.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: Jack’s truck turned up three days later in a
shopping mall in Toronto. Even without the footprints, the bullet,
Wade’s utter disappearance seemed evidence enough of his guilt.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed in
business. The Parker Mountain Ski Resort is now advertised all across
the country. Jimmy Dame tends bar at the lodge. Chub Merritt opened a
snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham runs the new Burger King. Margie
Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her mother; Lillian and Jill went with
Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>rolfe</strong>: We want to believe Wade died, died that same
November, froze to death on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot understand
how a man, a normal man, a man like you and me, could do such a terrible
thing. Unless the police happen to arrest a vagrant who turns out to be
Wade Whitehouse – or maybe he won’t be a vagrant; maybe he will have
turned himself into one of those faceless fellows working at the video
store and lives in a town-house apartment at the edge of town until his
mailman recognizes him from the picture at the post office – unless that
happens, there will be no more mention of him and his friend Jack Hewitt
and our father. The story will be over. Except that I continue.</p>
