<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Jesus, please… Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Hold it, hold on…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>radio dj #1</strong>: So it says here in today’s news that
science is looking for a lost minute of daylight.</p>
<p><strong>radio dj #2</strong>: Yeah, what’s that all about? They have
satellites now that can read our ATM receipts from outer space, but no
one knows how we lost a minute of sunlight?</p>
<p><strong>radio dj #1</strong>: When they find that minute…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: I know, Maya, but you’ll understand when
you see this man. I really need your strength.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Ensemble pour toujours quio qu’il
arrive.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Good seeing you again.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: Whish the circumstances were
different.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Your court order, Dr. Allen.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: You know I’m not comfortable with
this.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: But your patient is legally entitled to
it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: This patient has been plagued with
temporal lobe seizures.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: It’s the patient’s request, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: I’m aware of that, but I don’t think he’s
in any condition to make requests. I’m trying to appeal to your
more…logical self, Father. I’m concerned about harm to my patient.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of
St. Ursula’s, and our associate, Maya Larkin. Secular assistants are
permitted if regarded as qualified. Maya is eminently qualified.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: I think I should join you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: – you wouldn’t last five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Just open the door, please.</p>
<p><strong>birdson</strong>: How do you like the color in here? Spos’ed
to be relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Hello Henry. Do you know why we’re
here?</p>
<p><strong>birdson</strong>: Looking forward to it. Do you have a
cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>crosscut to a series of</strong>: FLASHCUTS:</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Do not remember, O Lord, our sins or those
of our forefathers.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: And do not punish us for our offences.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: And lead us not into temptation.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: But deliver us from evil…</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: My bowel is out. I told you. It’s open,
can’t you see it! My stomach’s been eviscerated!</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: My bowel!!! My stomach’s been eviscerated!
And you won’t help me! HELP ME!!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: Haldol, Cogenten, Atavan 5, 2 and 2
IM.</p>
<p><strong>father jeremy</strong>: Father, are you alright? Can you get
up?</p>
<p><strong>birdson</strong>: He’s right here, you know.</p>
<p><strong>birdson</strong>: Come on in…</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Mr. Silberman, you worked with the
defendant, George Viznick, for two years.</p>
<p><strong>mr. silberman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: And how would you describe
him?</p>
<p><strong>mr. silberman</strong>: Quiet. Real quiet…</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: And on the day of the murders, his
state of mind?</p>
<p><strong>mr. silberman</strong>: Seemed…on edge.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: On the day of the murders what did
the defendant request?</p>
<p><strong>mr. silberman</strong>: He asked to go home early. He said he
was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Tell the jury how many people work
in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.</p>
<p><strong>mr. silberman</strong>: Just me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mr. Kelson, here’s the stuff you wanted on
pathological narcissism.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What about that psychic, what’s his name,
Szabo?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He can see you Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think it’s gonna be a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The police used him as a witness in this
case.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll be at Bedford tonight, if you need
me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nice suit.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Hey! Mr. big shot.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mike. Oh, the christening. I meant to
call…</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yeah, right. I don’t know why I bothered
inviting you guys. I knew you wouldn’t show.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: So, Viznick’s got a meet with his lawyer in
the ayem.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Really? You know, seeing these guys away from
the court, the facade slips. You catch things.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I’ve heard it before. Just be
sure you spell my name right. Nine o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: So you can see where you’re going when you
crawl up his asshole.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: As a part of today’s story on the trial of
mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the
current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us,
Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks for having me, Sally.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Peter, you’re now writing a book about the
Viznick case. You seem to be making a career of studying sensational
murderers. I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in
courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, long-term exposure to things like this
tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After
awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s as if you are saying the closer you get
to evil, the less evil it becomes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, the less mystifying. Good and evil are
only illusions. There is no such thing as evil with a capital “E.” That
suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re referring to the defense’s efforts to
prove that George Viznick is tormented by “demonic voices?”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There weren’t any voices.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Not even from some mental illness, as the
prosecution asserts?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: As if there’s another cause for little
voices? No, Sally, Viznick’s a manipulator, he’s clever, he has what I
call malignant narcissism.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, we all have a degree of narcissism,
Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are you saying he’s legally sane?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of
gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He’s simply
unable to submit to any higher authority.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Meaning, Viznick’s a man who answers to no
one. Not even God.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right. If you believe in God. As a
narcissist, Viznick couldn’t blame himself for the alleged murders. He
created the voices after the fact. In order to avoid the simple truth
that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that
George Viznick needs to pay.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And what about you? What about Peter Kelson?
Where is your moral compass?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, lucky for me, I’m not on trial, Sally.
However, I like to think I’m the actual needle on the compass. Morality
is which way you’re facing. The needle always points north.</p>
<p><strong>tech director</strong>: Sally’s hot for this guy.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: He’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Peter…Kelson, ah, thank you for joining
us.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A pleasure, Sally.</p>
<p><strong>tech director</strong>: And that’s a cut.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Would you sign it for me?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you think they have a room here?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: How’d your interview go? I’m sure you
charmed the hell out of Sally.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She’s a talk show host. They can’t be
charmed. By definition.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: How’re you doing? Looking lovely as
always.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Alright, you shrieking harpies, enough
of that racket. Be off with you.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: And if you have to sin tonight, try to
make it something original.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Between your book sales and this TV
thing, there’s going to be no living with you. And let me guess, you
boiled God down to a conceit.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know how I feel. The world is random. The
only certainty I believe in is death.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Given all that’s happened, I
understand. The world is random, but then there’s faith. Where are you
in death without it?</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: What a…jerk!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Peter, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s great of you to let William and Susan
stay at the house until he gets on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s Susan’s cooking, Claire. That’s why
Uncle James lets them stay.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Nonsense, it’s all of our home. So
how’s work treating you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Frustrating. Form over content. Everything’s
so retro.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Well, if Peter here would hop off his
laurels long enough to marry you…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …you wearing a watch, Father?</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Yes. It’s exactly…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Can you check the century hand for me? Mine
seems to be ahead.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: …as a narcissist, he couldn’t blame himself.
He created the voices after the fact.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: Maya? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’ll explain everything later. Can you meet me
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: About time, I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I could use a drink.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’ve got martinis on ice and I grabbed some
good bottles from the cellar.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hey, Peter, I missed your show. How’d it
go?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Don’t worry, we taped it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think they got my best side.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This is it. If you need anything else, get it
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Susan, I don’t see any salt.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You know, I made a reservation at Marco’s
for Peter’s birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: What time did you make it for?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Eight. That okay?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: By the way, I want your advice on what to
get him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t want you spending any money on me.
Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Peter, in life, you should never deny
the giver the pleasure of the gift. All those years raising him. They
seem to have had absolutely no effect. Now William, at least he listened
to me.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Let’s eat already.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy gifts
through they bounty through Christ our Lord. And a special blessing for
Peter and William’s mother, Andrea, and their father, Jack, in whose
memory we gather here every year. May their souls and the souls of the
faithfully departed rest in peace. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, Will, remember that dream I used to have
over and over again when I was little, about the bear and the mountain.
You know, right after…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: …well, you know, I really think the trial’s
getting to me, because I’ve been having this weird dream every night.
Only this time, of course, it’s much different…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You never said anything to me…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s probably trivial.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Recurring dreams are never insignificant.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay, I’ll tell you. I’m reading a book - I
can’t remember what the book is when I wake up - but I realize halfway
through it’s something I’ve written. Or will write. Anyway, I get to the
end of the book and I’m feeling very satisfied and I close the cover to
read the title and it only says “x-e-s”. Three letters. For some reason,
that makes me feel great, and I wake up.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Peter, “x-e-s” is “sex” spelled
backwards.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What can I say? I’m not a master of the
obvious.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s been a long time since his last seizure.
I guess we’ve got to adjust his medication again.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: And what are you thinking we should do
now?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’ve filed a report with Father Frank.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: A lot of good that’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: We need all the help we can get.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: I’ve dealt with these people before, Maya.
They’re not going to help us.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: We’ll see Father Frank in the morning. There’s
nothing to be done until then.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: Alright, Maya. We’ll do it your way.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: Don’t forget to polish the brass
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: Maya, the Diocese has rejected your
report. And I must say, I agree with them.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: I don’t mean to belittle you, but
we’ve been through this before. Satan is not what you think he is. Satan
is not some creature.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You weren’t there. Give me time to get some
proof.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: Please, Maya. I’m trying to get us
into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: If you really believe in God, why is it so
inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: Maya, for the last time, I will not
tolerate these obsessions.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Stupid man. I can’t do this…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’re not real.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Father, it’s me, Maya. Tu m’entends?</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: …the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank
again.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Father, I’m right here.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: …the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank
again…</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: He’s not going to respond…</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: The doctor’s concerned he may never
come out of this dementia.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: He will. He has great faith.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: But bad judgement. And now you see how
dangerous the consequences can be.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: John. I’ve got to head back to the city. Would
you page me if there’s any change whatsoever? Anything, okay?</p>
<p><strong>father jeremy</strong>: I wish I could help.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: It’s useless…look at him.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You can’t back out on me now. We need to be
sure.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: Sure of what? Who cares if this guy is
devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle? Results are what Lareaux
would want.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: You don’t want to face it.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Look, John, I’m facing it.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: I’m not waiting until it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: Is he going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hi, I’d like to make an appointment for Peter
Kelson.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: no, he’s not a new patient. Okay, thank you,
bye.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hi, I’d like to make an appointment for Peter
Kelson. No, he’s a returning patient. You don’t. Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hi, I’d like to make an appointment for Peter
Kelson.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Kelson, hold on a second…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Okay, Mr. Kelson hasn’t been here in
awhile…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Tomorrow. Ten o’clock? Great.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I don’t know how to begin, by boyfriend… my
ex-boyfriend. The last time we were together, he, shit…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but
I don’t want to tell him. I’m RH negative. My blood type is negative… If
he’s RH positive, I’ll have to terminate.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: How many weeks are you honey/</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Thirteen. The last time, can you believe it?
This is how he says “Goodbye?”</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You need his blood-type. Like right
away.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well I know he’s come here before.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter…Peter Kelson.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You just call?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I didn’t know what else to do…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You’re in luck. Says Peter Kelson’s
an… AB negative.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Two negatives always make a
positive.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh, thank you, thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yes, I have some questions regarding the
baptismal records for one of our new constituents.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: And the person’s name?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter Kelson.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mrs. Quintana, let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. quintana</strong>: I plan to. You want a tip?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lemme guess. The lottery.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. quintana</strong>: Sometimes I can just feel the
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know what they say. You have the same
chance of winning whether you play or not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. quintana</strong>: You watch. One day, I’ll hit the
jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes. I’ll have more money than
God.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. quintana</strong>: Y yo tendre mi propria
secretaria.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’d you forget?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter Kelson?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes… and you are?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I saw you on television yesterday. You were
brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thank you. Do you work in the building? You
coming from the party?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You said that malignant narcissism was not
evil.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not pure evil. That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: And also that…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, I’m sorry, but I’m running late.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: That there is no such thing as evil with a
capital “E.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not the most popular opinion, but yes.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What if I told you I was a malignant
narcissist?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A narcissist doesn’t admit it. It’s the
extreme of self-denial.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: And I also believe in God and the Devil. In
fact, I know they exist.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, by saying that, you’re acknowledging
the existence of a higher power. Which, to a narcissist, is
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson. And while
they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: In the end, the jury saw it my way.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, then it all seems to be working out for
you. Listen, Ms…?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Do you remember Henry Birdson? The math
professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his
family?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s that got to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Last week the Catholic Church certified him as
genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It
failed. Disastrously. Which means there’s still a demonic spirit present
in his body. I was wondering, perhaps you’d like to go meet Henry. He’s
pretty amazing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.
If you’re really that confident, you’d be willing to let someone prove
you wrong?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The world would be so much simpler if it were
all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery
and elusive place.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well, I think it’s very simple. Here’s a tape
of Birdson’s exorcism. I’ll be at the Public Library. Tomorrow at 2… if
you want to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I believe that murder and murderers are the
most interesting proving ground for these kinds of questions. Don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Great sound. How the hell do you live with
that all day?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mrs. Levotsky, jeez you…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let me help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. levotsky</strong>: What’re you look at?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi guys. Claire?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mrs. Levotsky, we really need to have a
couple brews and talk one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’d you expect?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh…come on, lady! Give me a break!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Little cough syrup will do ya, eh,
granny?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Shi… Sorry, honey. I was having the weirdest
dream.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Bad?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Weird. The book again. Sex spelled
backwards…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I must really be slacking off. Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh…sure…I…what?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Sushi.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I can’t believe it’s already starting to get
dark so early.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You know, there was a guy on the radio today
trying to explain why we’re losing daylight. Quarks and dark matter,
things like that. Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over
the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Peter, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry. It’s just…a strange woman waltzes into
my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan
exists.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Did she waltz in or fly on little bat
wings?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Says she can get me in to see this
killer.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Now that you’re on TV, you’re a magnet for
all the wackos out there.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh, Peter, you’re going to pursue this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. Of course not. Mmmm. Anago. My
favorite.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: George, come in. What the hell
happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>viznick</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Sure it is. If the guards did
this, we can file charges.</p>
<p><strong>viznick</strong>: Not the guards. Some of the prisoners are
easily disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: You have to tell me who did
it.</p>
<p><strong>viznick</strong>: I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: I’m gonna go make a stink. Sit
tight. I’ll make sure you get a change of clothes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Seems George isn’t making too many friends in
lockup.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yeah, look at that sweet face. You’d never
guess he killed nine people. I’m gonna get my smokes. Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re too old to smoke. Won’t be able to
shoot hoops with your grandkid.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: What the fuck’s that?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t fool me, Georgie.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s looking right at me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He could see me.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I’ll quit, maybe you should start.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe…my imagination.</p>
<p><strong>cranky woman</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hey, what are you doing here in the middle
of the day?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the
fourth floor?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I spaced out.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, it’s a nice surprise. Should I hit the
“stop” button?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Thanks. I’m glad you came. Take the
Williamsburg Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So…what did you think of the tape.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think you gave me the wrong one.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the
wrong one.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’re sure? There was nothing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but
hum.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So what’d I miss?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’re right. I must’ve made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Shouldn’t we wait for the doctor?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’m sure she won’t mind. It’s not locked?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Not necessary…anymore.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you.
I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.
I am a fan.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Quite a compliment coming from you,
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: When your secretary called, she made no
mention of her coming, too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My secretary?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: You’re aware that this woman was party to
the so-called exorcism.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I wasn’t, actually.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson
needed anything but professional psychiatric care. And then, minutes
after they left, he suffered a stroke. He’s comatose. No brain wave
activity at all.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So you don’t believe his condition is the
result of anything supernatural?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: Of course not. They put him through
severe mental stress. Causing this aneurysm.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson
what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson’s room?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: I certainly hope you’re not lending any
credence to this.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: The patient was in great distress.
Naturally he was…yelling.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: And was he in distress when you opened the
door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: There is a medical explanation for
everything that happened.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You heard voices, you know you did.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: It sounded like a hundred people to me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: I’ve already said, Mr. Birdson was
agitated. Victor, why don’t you go and check on the patient in room
5.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just describe it to me, the scene, when you
came back.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: He just woke up. He’s awake.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: I’m surprised at you, Mr. Kelson. And now
I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask the two of you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where do you get off pretending to be my
secretary?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I had to.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And this is evil? The guy had an aneurysm and
now he’s in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: That’s their explanation. You might not
believe me…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, why should I? Alright, what’s your
name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Detective Smythe? Hey, Mike, it’s Peter.
Could you pull some prints off something for me?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: So, guess which stylist just got this
month’s “Elle” cover?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re amazing.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hurry up, you don’t want to be late.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Did you hear how the TIMES zinged Paul
Guenette’s new book? They said “He writes for the ages - between five
and twelve.”</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: I saw you on the news. But I think you’re
even better live.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He is. By the way, Lauren, did you ever
finish your book on tattoo art? I hear your publisher wants his advance
back.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>second young woman</strong>: I think Rhonda Huston’s
assistant was just made an editor at S&amp;S.</p>
<p><strong>second young man</strong>: The guy with the weird
fingernails? Imagine looking over galleys with him.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: So, Peter, how crowded is the field now?
There are, what, seven books in the offing about the Viznick case?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, but no one has the access I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Is it true the cops used a psychic?</p>
<p><strong>second young woman</strong>: I saw a psychic once. Some of
these guys are definitely for real.</p>
<p><strong>second young man</strong>: Oh, really? I dropped $250 on a
session once and they guy didn’t get a thing right.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: And you, Peter? Where do you stand?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wherever there’s room.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: None for me, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: God will forgive me, the time of
transformation is so near.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks for handling this.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Sure thing. Look, I’ve got enough, between
your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts. You can go
home. Gimme til morning. Find out who he is. Until then, don’t sweat it,
huh? Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Well said.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Colloquialisms 101. My only “A” in the
Academy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks again for everything.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Hey, don’t thank me. Somebody up there likes
you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Will, this is…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Can we please leave now?</p>
<p><strong>josef</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Kelson. Miss Claire.</p>
<p><strong>josef</strong>: I want to tell you…your neighbor,
Mrs. Levotsky, she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What? That’s horrible!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>josef</strong>: Apparently she killed herself sometime last
night. The paramedics told me she hung herself. Climbed up on her
dresser, stocking around her neck, but I don’t know. She was completely
rheumatoid… It’s a shame. Anyway, though you should know.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks, Josef.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: When did they find her?</p>
<p><strong>josef</strong>: A few hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: It’s moments like this that make it
clear. All that matters is those we love are with us.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m still shaking.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t believe Will killed him.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Thank God he did.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know what I’d do without you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m going to bed. Don’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Something he said, just before…</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: He spoke to you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. It didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Listen to me, Peter. You can’t let the
ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re right, but it’s funny. All my life I
thought I was simply a man who didn’t believe in any of it.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: No matter, my son, he believes in
you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But it’s true. I have no faith. It’s strange.
When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never
frightened. It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me
and…in that one moment I didn’t care about anything. Not eve my own
life.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Peter. Your life must matter to you
because it matters to all of us who love you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know, I respect that you have such faith,
James. I don’t understand it, but I want you to know that despite our
differences, I admire you and I always will.</p>
<p><strong>father jeremy</strong>: I appreciate your saying that. I’m
gonna go now. I believe you’re wanted elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>father jeremy</strong>: His faith wavered. He tried to shoot
Kelson last night. I don’t know all the details.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Was anyone else hurt?</p>
<p><strong>father jeremy</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>father jeremy</strong>: Be careful, Maya.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. quintana</strong>: It’s Detective Smythe.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: How’re you doin’ today?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s another day. I think I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we
gotta talk.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I’m fed up inside, let’s walk.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: We traced this guy to a seminary in Newark.
If you can believe it, he was a deacon. Talked to the man in charge
there, a Father Frank Page. He said the gunman, John Townsend, was
caught up in some nonsense about the Devil, along with a priest named
Lareaux and a woman named Maya Larkin - the same woman whose prints were
on that coffee cup. Now can I please get the fill?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She came to me with a wild story about
demonic possession.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: She’s got a juvenile record from New
Orleans. Parents died when she was 13.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Parents died?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yeah, murder-suicide.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Mother killed the father, then killed
herself. Crime of passion.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She told me she killed them.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Not what the records show. Anyway, she was a
runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit.
Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a
retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn’t been
in any trouble since.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: We hauled her in earlier but didn’t have
anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won’t
be bothering you. Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get
this - during an exorcism.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where is she now?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Had to let her go. I see you thinkin’ there,
superstar. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I’m sure I don’t have to remind you she’s
still a possible accessory to attempted murder…</p>
<p><strong>the class</strong>: Le Chapeau.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Tres bien.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: …and the obvious, you could get another gun
in your face.</p>
<p><strong>the class</strong>: Le Chien.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t worry, I won’t go anywhere near
her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter, please…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Children, I’ll be right back. Just stay
in…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: …your seats. Be right back. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to
shoot me and now I find out you knew him. What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Please, the children.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why did he try to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Townsend believed, just as God became man in
Christ. So Satan will assume human form. I believe it too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And the point is?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is
about to take over the body of a man. You are that man, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?!?!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: It’s true. Birdson knew your name, he was
writing it in numerical code. It wasn’t easy but I figured it out. It
spelled your name.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why didn’t Birdson just say so?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: If you’re possessed, you can’t reveal anything
Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Trick him.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: The good outwitting the bad. It’s like Birdson
had a split personality.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You should think about getting professional
help.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’re already contaminated. It’s why you
couldn’t hear the tape. There’s probably a pentacle near your bed. To
sanctify you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m not going to be drawn into this.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check
your parents’ blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth
parents?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My parents are dead. Don’t even think of
bringing them into this.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’re about to become the anti-Christ who is
born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you or any of your lunatic friends ever
come near me again…</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: I’ve had it. Townsend’s dead. The
police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the
children. I’m sorry, Maya, you’ve been with us for many years, but
effective immediately, I’m rescinding your right to live at the
church.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Father, I have nowhere else to stay.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: You have a sister in New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m gonna have to get a restraining order.
What a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know. In a way, I’m glad it all
happened.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re glad somebody tried to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No, of course not, but I think now that this
has happened, a lot of things can start to come out…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, like…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Like you need to admit that losing your
parents when you were twelve was traumatic.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s with me all the time, Claire, I just
don’t like to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Well, it shattered your faith in
everything.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m just temporarily off my game.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You need to believe in something besides
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I believe in you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I love you. You look a mess. Why don’t you
go home and clean up before you go back to work.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I can’t do this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: You have to put your napkin in your
lap.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Gina!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: It’s okay. Better?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m sorry, she’s very into rules.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Doesn’t your daughter put her napkin in
her lap?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I don’t have a daughter. I’m not married.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Aren’t you lonely?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Okay, Gina, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I have someone who takes care of me.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: But he’s dead. Jesus is dead.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: You’re so weak.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. quintana</strong>: Good of you to stop by.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We millionaires yet?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Umm, Melvin Szabo, this is Peter Kelson.
Peter, this is the psychic.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’d appreciate it if you’d put that back.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: You are the younger of two…</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: You’re afraid of committing to this
girl.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: But she worships you. Your mother’s dead but
your father’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nothing you couldn’t find out from reading
the papers. And you’re already wrong on one count.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Viznick will get off and Michael’s got a
crush on you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know what? You can go.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Suit yourself. But does this mean anything
to you?</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: You do know, don’t you. That these are also
numbers. Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666. The sign of the
Devil.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: God will forgive me…the time of
transformation is so near.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get the fuck out of here!</p>
<p><strong>lithuanian priest</strong>: See you all next week!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go ahead, do something. Show me.</p>
<p><strong>day-care worker</strong>: Go on, get them inside! Look, you
don’t have a job here anymore. They want you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t understand what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: There’s no reason why you should. This has
been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.
Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But I was baptized. And I certainly wasn’t
born of incest.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You were not baptized. At least I don’t
believe it was Christian. Your baptism was performed by your uncle,
James McKenzie.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: The only baptism he ever performed in seven
years as pastor at Bedford.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Seven years. One baptism? He’s your mother’s
only brother</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Do you know your parents’ blood types?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I looked at the coroner’s report. My father’s
O positive and my mother…A negative.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There’s
no way your birth father can be O positive. You father is not who you
think he is.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So…then the coroner’s report is probably
wrong. I mean…this is ridiculous. There’s been a mistake. I don’t
believe any of this.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Then why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.
Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your
blood-type doesn’t match who you thought your father was. Peter…I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And if what you’re saying is true, what would
happen to me?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I don’t know. I do know that people who are
possessed have to accept evil in some way. I don’t know if it works the
same way in this instance. I don’t even know when it’s going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: When Townsend tried to kill me, he said
something strange like… “The time of transformation is near…”</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Townsend, he had some of Father’s books.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you looking for exactly?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: The books themselves or maybe some pages he
ripped out.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s got all my books.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: We needed to know all we could.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m going to look around.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll be upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not much upstairs A couple of empty bedrooms
and a bathroom. Anything here?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll go outside and take a look in the
garage.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Jesus, Peter, you scared me.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Look at this…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Henry, Christ loves you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Christ can save you, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Just say his name, say his name and you’ll be
free.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Say his name.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Christ loves you…</p>
<p><strong>birdson</strong>: Yes, but does he swallow?</p>
<p><strong>birdson</strong>: Fucking bitch! Open the door!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: AHHHH!!!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Get up!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the…OH SHIT!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter, let go of the chair!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: LET GO OF THE CHAIR!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: He can’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: When’s your birthday?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Your 33rd birthday. The transformation will be
a perversion of Christ’s rising from the dead. Townsend discovered it in
one of Lareaux’s books.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: It’ll happen at the exact time of your
birth.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That can’t be right. My birthday’s
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>birdson</strong>: My demon of anguish, help me create
confusion and suffering forever and ever… and ever…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: He couldn’t stop us and that’s how he was
punished. Peter, what time were you born?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know. Probably have a copy of my
birth certificate…my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: There’s nothing else here.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the bible for?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Comfort.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Watch it!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: PETER!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What the hell’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have
these…visions.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I see things. My worst fears. You need to know
something, Peter. I was possessed once. Like Birdson. It took Father
Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’m scared I’m slipping back.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re going to do this.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You have to say that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Now this daylight thing is up to two minutes
and scientists say sooner or later, we’ll be losing like fifteen minutes
a day.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Five-twelve.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Now I’ll never be on time for work.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why did you lie to me about your parents’
deaths?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I was desperate. I knew you wrote about
murders. I needed a way in.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Close call. For the first time in a long
time, it’s really hitting me. Life’s tenuous.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I know it is. Right after my parents died, I
went to the beach… I was in the water. Everything was calm. And then one
of those really big waves hit me. Hard. Pulled me straight to the
bottom. I struggled and finally ran out of air. If it hadn’t been for my
sister who pulled me out, I would’ve drowned. Legally dead for a couple
of minutes is what they told me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No oxygen to the brain.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Maybe that’s my problem.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why didn’t you just go along with Townsend.
Get rid of me. I would’ve…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Until it happens, you’re still a human
being.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What about after?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Only your body will remain. I believe your
soul will be at peace. If we kill you, Satan can’t stay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Claire, are you home?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: More air. Always a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Tomorrow afternoon. Four forty-five.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Plenty of time.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know. Extra apartment keys. What’s it
matter?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Maybe I should check Lareaux’s book. It’s in
the car. Be right back. Don’t go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: There you are! My God, darling, I’ve been so
worried. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Claire…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This is the person…you were talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’re these?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know. What are they?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I found them in your file box.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Must be a spare set.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought the spare set was in the kitchen
drawer.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You were hiding them.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Honey, you’re exhausted. Do you want to lie
down for a little while?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I found the pentacle.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: She’s been stalking you, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So you’re going to kill her? Put the gun down
Claire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I’m trying
to protect you!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You really had me going, Claire. I was
finally ready to propose to you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We’re still going to be together.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: There’s nothing you can do about it. I’ve
fucking had it with you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hi, it’s me. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Lareaux…he’s coming out of it. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: I’m glad you’re here. There’s
something you need to see.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Miette…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Father! Thank God you’re better! I really need
your help. We’ve only got a few more hours.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Don’t worry…about the transformation,
Maya.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What do you mean “don’t worry?”</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Well, in my prayers, I realized we’ve been
fooling ourselves and probably… blown this all out of proportion. God
would never allow anything like that to happen.</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: I told you this was myth all
along.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Does that mean it’s over?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So…we won?</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Yes. We won, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: We won because Christ…triumphed over
Satan?</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Um hm. That’s right, Maya.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So, if Christ won, that means, what does that
mean, Father? That Satan…</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Would you like to rest, Miette? You must be
exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So I guess Satan lost. Satan is the weak
one.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Miette, come here and relax.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I can relax, because Satan the coward,
trembles before Christ, right?</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: All right. That’s enough for now. He’s
just recovering. Take it easy, Maya.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: But doesn’t he tremble, Father? Doesn’t he
cower, like a frightened jackal? Satan, the half-wit…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: The whimpering slave of Christ! The impotent
dog on God’s leash!</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: HE’LL MAKE CHRIST CRAWL!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: He’s our best chance. If we can get him
back.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You have to be experienced to do this. Just
wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’ll do it?</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: I don’t have the experience. Father
Thomas should officiate.</p>
<p><strong>maya and father jeremy stand close together in the
hallway.</strong>: WE HEAR HER WHISPERED MURMUR.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: Tie him to the chair.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>father frank</strong>: There’s nothing we can do but pray.
We’ll be in the church.</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: Behold the Cross of the Lord. Depart,
enemies! Unclean spirits, and all your companions, I command you. Tell
me your name!</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: …by the love and power of Christ, who
has redeemed man from your grasp, I command you.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Peter, Peter…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Peter, Peter…</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: …be gone and leave this child of the
Lord God almighty. Be gone, by the power of Christ. Be gone, by the
power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: In the name of Christ, I command you.
Tell me your name!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Too late, too late, too late, too late.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Please, no!</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: Move, move!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Peter, help me. Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: Jeremy, the door!</p>
<p><strong>father jeremy</strong>: It…I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: Lowly beast, through the power of
Christ. Let the door re-open.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Go on. Do something. Show me. I’m scared
I’m slipping back…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maya?</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Rock-a-bye baby, on a tree top…</p>
<p><strong>father thomas</strong>: Confiterisne vitia tua ante
omnipotentem deum?</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: …the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank
again…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Father, please don’t die.</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: …art sank, sun set, ark sank again…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>lareaux</strong>: Ensemble pour toujours quoi qu’il
arrive.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought you were in danger.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’ll be all right. Peter, at the very end, I
think Father was back. I saw it in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So, what does it mean. The ark sank and the
sun set?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: He’s been repeating that since Birdson’s
exorcism. I looked in every passage in the Bible and there’s nothing
about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What did he say to you in French?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: That’s his, I don’t know, his ‘grounding’
phrase for me, “together, no matter what.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: He was trying to tell me something.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And his message was “Together, no matter
what?”</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Helloooo - do you live around here? How do I
get to the turnpike?</p>
<p><strong>irked motorist</strong>: THERE’S FIVE FUCKING CARS BEHIND
YOU, ASSHOLE!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lady, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Wait a minute. The message. He used French, he
knew he couldn’t say it directly. The arc “sank” or “cinq” c-i n-q. It’s
French for five. The sun “set” or pronounced like “sept”. The French
word for seven. The arc “sank” again. It’s five-seven-fie. Book chapter
and verse!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse
five. “But this shall you deal with them. You shall break down their
altars and burn their graven images with fire.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And what’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: An international group of scientists
will assemble in Geneva later this week in an attempt to determine the
cause of diminishing daylight, a phenomenon which has baffled the
world’s finest scientific minds. In local news, the case of accused
killer George Viznick ended in a mistrial today. Prosecutors vowed to
press for a new trial immediately.</p>
<p><strong>reader</strong>: God appears and God is light to those pour
souls who dwell in night.</p>
<p><strong>reader</strong>: But does a human form display…</p>
<p><strong>reader</strong>: Welcome!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Eight minutes…</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Did you really think you could just
burn the church down. That some ritualistic hocus pocus could just end
this?</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Lareaux was never free of us. He led
you here. “Get me to the church on time.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You fucking bastard.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Don’t you get it? They had their 2,000
years. Now it’s our turn.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So all that bullshit about God and faith.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: It was perfect. The harder I pushed,
the more you pulled away.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You lied to me my whole life. Everything you
said, everything you did.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: Everything I did, I did for you. I
love you, Peter. Think of it. I’m giving you a gift, absolute power and
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You raised me, like a son.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: You are my son. Don’t you see the
opportunity that lies before you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You killed my parents.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: I had to. There was no other way.
Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given
you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Don’t! That’s what they want.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: It will be my ultimate sacrifice!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: If you commit murder, you accept evil.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Drop the knife.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: She’s going to die right in front of
you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Let him kill me.</p>
<p><strong>father james</strong>: You have no idea how much you look
like your mother right now.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And you thought I was the family fuck
up.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thank you, Maya. You served us well.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How much time do we have?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Not a lot.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you can do it…go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’m not strong enough for this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It didn’t work! Maya, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s me. Put the gun down. Maya…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you really think I’m the Devil, then shoot
me.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: I love this, now scientists are saying the
days have suddenly stopped getting shorter. It makes you wonder. Do
these guys know anything?</p>
