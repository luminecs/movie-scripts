conscience.</p>

<p><strong>personnel officer</strong>: Hell, we ain’t that much fussy

<p><strong>travis</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>personnel officer</strong>: Well then check back
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: April 10, 1972. Thank God for the rain which
has helped wash the garbage and trash off the sidewalks.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m working a single now, which means
stretch-shifts, six to six, sometimes six to eight in the a.m., six days
a week.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: It’s a hustle, but it keeps me busy. I can
take in three to three-fifty a week, more with skims.</p>
<p><strong>man in business suit</strong>: Is Kennedy operating, cabbie?
Is it grounded?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Why should it be grounded?</p>
<p><strong>man in business suit</strong>: Listen - I mean I just saw the
needle of the Empire State Building. You can’t see it for the fog!</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Then it’s a good guess it’s grounded.</p>
<p><strong>man in business suit</strong>: The Empire State in fog means
something, don’t it? Do you know, or don’t you? What is your number,
cabbie?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Have you tried the telephone?</p>
<p><strong>man in business suit</strong>: There isn’t time for that. In
other words, you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man in business suit</strong>: Well, you should know, damn
it, or who else would know? Pull over right here. Why don’t you stick
your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out
about the goddamn fog!</p>
<p><strong>man in business suit</strong>: Taxi! Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I work the whole city, up, down, don’t make
no difference to me - does to some.</p>
<p><strong>streetside</strong>: TRAVIS’ P.O.V. Black PROSTITUTE wearing
white vinyl boots, leopard-skin mini-skirt and blond wig hails taxi. On
her arm hangs half-drunk seedy EXECUTIVE TYPE.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Some won’t take spooks - Hell, don’t make no
difference tom me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh baby, baby.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: They’re all animals anyway. All the animals
come out at night: Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies,
dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all
this scum off the streets.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Each night when I return the cab to the
garage I have to clean the come off the back seat. Some nights I clean
off the blood.</p>
<p><strong>slight timecut</strong>: TRAVIS books it at garage office.
Old, rotting slabs of wood are screwed to a grey crumbling concrete
wall. Each available space is covered with hand- lettered signs, time
schedules, check-out sheets, memos. The signs read:</p>
<p><strong>judson 2-3410</strong>: AND MUST FILE A REPORT Promptly</p>
<p><strong>at 9 am the following morning at</strong>: 43 W. 61st.</p>
<p><strong>1st cabbie</strong>: … hadda piss like a bull steer, so I
pull over on 10th Ave, yank up the hood and do the engine job. There I
am with my dong in my hand when a guy come up and asks if I need any
help. Just checking the battery, I says, and, meanwhile…</p>
<p>****: </p>
<p><strong>2nd cabbie</strong>: If he thinks I’m going up into The
Jungle this time of night, he can shove it.</p>
<p><strong>3rd cabbie</strong>: Fuck that Violets First. Fucking saddle
horse. No, no, the OTB. Fuck them. No, it was TKR. TCR and I’da made
seven fucking grand. Fuck them too. Alright, what about the second
race?</p>
<p><strong>4th cabbie</strong>: Over at Love, this hooker took on the
whole garage. Blew the whole fucking joint and they wouldn’t even let
her use the drinking fountain.</p>
<p><strong>concession girl</strong>: Kin I help ya?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What is your name? My name is Travis.</p>
<p><strong>concession girl</strong>: Awh, come off it, Pal.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No, I’m serious, really…</p>
<p><strong>concession girl</strong>: Ya want me to call da boss? Huh?
That what you want?</p>
<p><strong>concession girl</strong>: No, no, it’s alright. I’ll have a
big Coca-Cola - without ice - and a large buttered popcorn, and… … some
of them chocolate covered malted milk balls… and ju-jukes, a box. They
last.</p>
<p><strong>concession girl</strong>: We don’t have ju-jukes. We don’t
have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>concession girl</strong>: That’s a dollar forty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>male movie voice</strong>: Come here, bitch. I’m gonna split
you in half.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Twelve hours of work and I still cannot
sleep. The days dwindle on forever and do not end.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Tom.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas
report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays
if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And
don’t forget to add the new photo releases.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The senator’s white paper is almost ready,
Bets. Should we wait for that?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Andy usually just sends those to the national
media. The local press doesn’t know what to do with a position paper
until UPI and AP tell them anyway.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I think we should try to get maximum coverage
for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: First push the man, then the issue. Senator
Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting,
fascinating man.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You forgot "sexy".</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, I didn’t forget "sexy".</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just didn’t get around to it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Oh, Tom, please.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you’re
selling… I don’t know what… cars… not issues.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the
highest ratings?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: More people watch it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Alright, forget it if you’re not going to be
serious,</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, c’mon, I’m listening. I was just…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Just what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Kidding around… you know, fun.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Maybe if you’d try thinking once in a while,
you’d get somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has
the highest ratings? You their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It’s
all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought
they had good news for people, right? You thought that’s why people
watched CBS? I’ll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You
got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told
people to eat soap, they’d do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, if Cronkite’s so great, why don’t we run
him instead?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s the last. The finish. Period. Some
pople can learn. Some people can’t. And you wonder why we never get
serious—-</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure we could run him. You realize he’s already
of his block association.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Have you been noticing anything strange?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why’s that taxi driver across the street been
staring at us?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What taxi driver?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That taxi driver. The one that’s been sitting
here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How long has he been there?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t know - but it feels like a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, I’ll go out and ask him.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: All my life needed was a sense of direction,
a sense of someplace to go. I do not believe one should devote his life
to morbid self- attention, but should become a person like other
people.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I first saw her at Palantine Campaign
Headquarters at 58th and Broadway. She was wearing a yellow dress,
answering the phone at her desk.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: She appeared like an angel out of this open
sewer. Out of this filthy mass. She is alone: They cannot touch her.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: First she did her make-up. You know, I hate
it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the
eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge…</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: The kind with a brush.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Travis.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hey Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Yeah, that’s Blush-On. My wife uses
it,</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Ask Travis. He’s the ladies man.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it.
And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind - and, on top
of that, get this, right when we’re crossing the Tri- boro bridge - she
changes her pantyhose!</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Could you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down,
sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean,
Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic’s practically standing
still.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and
fucked her brains out - What do you think! What do I have to do? Draw
you a picture?</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: What was I supposed to do? I was watching in
the rear view. You know, just checkin’ traffic. So howsit?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up. Just
heard it on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Stick up?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get
out of the cab. I said "Look, you’re in the middle of the fucking
bridge…"</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: You said that?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, I said, "Lady, please, we’re on a
bridge…"</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: And what happened?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: She stayed in the cab, what’s she gonna do?
but she stiffed me. A real skunk.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: A real skunk.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Yeah. We went to Harvard together.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the
dollars. He’ll chase a buck straight into Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Look who’s talking? Who else would stay
up all night to catch the morning rush hour?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: So howsit?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up.
Just heard it on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Stick up?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No, just some crazy fucker. Cut have his ear
off.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Where.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: In the jungle. 122nd.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: THREE STREET PEOPLE sitting at a table. One
GUY, stoned, stares straight ahead. A raggedly attractive GIRL rest her
head on the shoulder of the other, a heavily bearded YOUNG MAN with a
headband. They kiss and tease each other, momentarily lost in their
separate world.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: You run all over town, don’t you,
Travis?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Fuckin’ Mau Mau land, that’s what it is.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: I mean, you handle some pretty rough
traffic, huh?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: You carry a piece? You need one?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Nah. I suppose not.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Well, you ever need one, I know a feller
that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: The cops and company raise hell they find
out.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials
that blow up in your hand. But this guy don’t deal no shit. Just
quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: For a fee.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: For a fee.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: I never use mine. But it’s a good thing to
have. Just as a threat.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: well, if there’s this many hackies
inside, there must be lots of hares outside. And I’m gonna hustle
’em.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: What ya gonna do with all that money,
Dough-Boy?</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Support my kids. Can you dig it? nice to
meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Try holding the match like this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This is gotta be a game, right?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: This I gotta see.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Oh, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m great. Always set my fingers on fire. If
you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No. I just wanted to see if you could light
it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand,
Mr. Asbestos…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: He happens to be missing fingers. I first
noticed when -</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Is he Italian?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You sure he’s not Italian?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: He’s Black, OK?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, If he had been Italian, they could have
been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If
they blow a job or something.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: As I said, he isn’t Italian. Besides, I
thought they just killed them.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t be naive. They can’t kill everybody. They
have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a
stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. It’s symbolic.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why don’t they leave a pidgeon instead of a
canary?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe they don’t leave a canary.
Don’t be technical. What I’m saying is if this newsstand guy’s Italian
and his fingers are gone, maybe he’s a thief.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: First, he’s not Italian. Second he’s not a
thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right
change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown
away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a
cigarette. I couldn’t help watching. I was dying to see how he’d light
it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: With the other hand, right?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, stupid. With the stubs. That’s the whole
point.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An
old Black guy, the newsstand at -</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, this is young - well, I’m never sure how
old Black people are - but, anyway, he isn’t old. That’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Show me how he did that again.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I want to volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: If you’ll come this way.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No. I want to volunteer to you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Bets.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Because you are the most beautiful woman I
have ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Is that so? But what do you think of Charles
Palantine?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Who mam?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Charles Palantine. The man you want to
volunteer to help elect president.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh, I think he’s a wonderful man. Make a
great, great President.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You want to canvass?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yes, mam.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: How do you feel about Senator Palantine’s
stand on welfare?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Welfare, mam? I think the Senator’s right.
People should work for a living. I do. I like to work. Every day. Get
those old coots off welfare and make ’em work for a change.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Well, that’s not exactly what the Senator has
proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other
work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good
worker.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: if you talk to Tom, he’ll assign you to
something.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: If you don’t mind, mam, I’d rather work for
you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Well, we’re all working tonight.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at
night.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Well, then, what is it you exactly want to
do?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: If you don’t mind, mam, I’d be mighty
pleased if you’d go out and have some coffee and pie with me.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here
in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big
long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that’s a lonely
girl. She needs a friend. And I’m gonna be her friend.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: It’s just to the corner, mam. In broad
daytime. Nothing can happen. I’ll be there to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: All right. All right. I’m taking a break at
four o’clock. If you’re here then we’ll go to the corner and have some
coffee and pie.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I’ll be
here at four o’clock exactly. And… ah… Betsy…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: My name is Travis.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m just going to find out what the cabbies
are thinking.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: April 26, 1972. Four o’clock p.m. I took
Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee Shop on Broadway…</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I had black coffee and apple pie with a
slice of melted yellow cheese. I think that was a good selection. Betsy
had coffee and a fruit salad dish. She could have had anything she
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: We’ve signed up 15.000 Palantine volunteers
in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just
staggering.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I know what you mean. I’ve got the same
problems. I just can’t get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like
my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One
of these days I’m Gonna Organezizied".</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Travis, I never ever met anybody like you
before.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I can believe that.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain’t
much.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: So why did you decide to drive a taxi at
night?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I had a regular job for a while, days. You
know, doin’ this, doin’ that. But I didn’t have anything to do at night.
I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to
works nights. It ain’t good to be alone, you know.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: After this job, I’m looking forward to being
alone for a while.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah, well… In a cab you get to meet people.
You meet lotsa people. It’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What kind of people?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Just people people, you know. Just people.
Had a dead man once.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: He’d been shot. I didn’t know that. He just
crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I shot the meter off, for one thing. I knew
I wasn’t goimg to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They
took him.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s really something.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab.
Especially when the moon’s out.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: The moon?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: The full moon. One night I had three or four
weirdoes in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was - the
full moon.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh, yeah. People will do anything in front
of a taxi driver. I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel
room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to
embarrass you. It’s like you’re not even there, not even a person.
Nobody knows you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Com’on, Travis. It’s not that bad. I take
lots of taxis.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I know. I could have picked you up.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Late one night. About three. At the
plaza.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Three in the morning? I don’t think so. I
have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody
else.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No. It was you. You had some manila folders
and a pink bag from Saks.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You’re right! Now I remember! It was after
the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late.
The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: If it wasn’t for a drunk I would have picked
you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: The DMZ?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch
him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That’s the
law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That would have been quite a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You’d be surprised how often you see the
same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or
less the same things every day. I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Well, I don’t go to the Plaza every
night.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I didn’t mean you. But just ordinary people.
A guy I know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way. They got to talking.
She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the
bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s very romantic. Some of your fares must
be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, no… not really… had some famous people
in the cab. I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the
big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt
like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What hours do you work?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I work a single, which means there’s no
replacement - no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight.
Seventy-two hours a week.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You mean you work seventy-two hours a
week.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a
few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a
night.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You must be rich.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: it keeps ya busy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You know what you remind me of?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it’s
said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly ficition, a walking
contradiction".</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have
pushed.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I didn’t mean that, Travis. Just the part
about the contradiction.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh. Who was that again?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: The singer?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah. Yes. I don’t follow music too
much.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Kris Kristofferson.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You work at night, you get an instinct. You
can smell them. The big tippers, the stiffs, the trouble makers. Quarter
is good tip for Manhattan. Queens is better, Brooklyn is best. go for
the guys with suitcases. The rich are the worst tippers, hooks are
lousy. Spooks are okay, but they don’t live at Park Ave after all.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I called Betsy again at her office, and she
said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work
tomorrow. That’s my day off. At first she hesitated, but I called her
again and she agreed. Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name
again. Damn. I’ve got to remember stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: St. Regis Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s 12:30 now. You’ll have fifteen minutes
before the actual luncheon begins.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: I don’t think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from
California.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Say, aren’t you Charles Palantine, the
candidate?</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, I’m one of your biggest supporters. I
tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: Why, thank you Travis.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m sure you’ll win, sir. Everybody I know
is going to vote for you. I was going to put one of your stickers on my
taxi but the company said it was against their policy.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: I’ll tell you, Travis, I’ve learned more
about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of
General Motors.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: And in some other places too…</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: Travis, what single thing would you want
the next President of this country to do most?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I don’t know, sir. I don’t follow political
issues much.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: There must be something…</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, he should clean up this city here.
It’s full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It’s like an open sewer. I
can hardly take it.</p>
<p>****: </p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Some days I go out and smell it then I get
headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that
would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: I know what you mean, Travis, and it’s
not going to be easy. We’re going to have to make some radical
changes.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Damn straight.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: Nice talking to you, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Thank you, sir. You’re a good man, sir.</p>
<p><strong>aides.</strong>: </p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You didn’t have to spend your money - ?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: He’ll, what else can I do with it all?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Travis, you haven’t even played the
record?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But
I’m sure the record is OK.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand
that. I live on music.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I don’t follow music much. I’d like to
though. Honest.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: So you haven’t heard this record yet?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No. I thought maybe you could play it for me
on your player.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I bought a couple of tickets.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But this is a porno movie.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No, these are the kind that couples go to.
They’re not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I’ve
seen them.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: These are not the kind of movies I go to.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, I don’t follow movies too much…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You mean these are the only kind of movies
you go to?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: This is sort of high class…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I mean porno movies.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well… mostly…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: My God!</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: We can go to another movie if you like, I
don’t care. I got money. There’s plenty…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: If you just wanted to fuck, why didn’t you
just come right out and say it?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: … there’s plenty of movies around here. I
haven’t seen any of them, but I’m sure they’re good.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, Travis. You’re a sweet guy and all that,
but I think this is it. I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You mean you don’t want to go to a movie?
There’s plenty of movies around here.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, I don’t feel so good. We’re just two very
different kinds of people, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It’s very simple. You go your way, I’ll go
mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: But… Betsy…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m getting a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What about the record?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Can I call you?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Please, Betsy, I bought it for you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: All right, I’ll accept the record.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: But I got a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: May 8, 1972. My life has taken another turn
again. The days move along with regularity…</p>
<p><strong>later that day</strong>: TRAVIS has pulled his
straight-backed chair around and is watching his small portable TV,
which rests on the upright melon crate.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: … one day indistinguishable from the next, a
long continuous chain, then suddenly - there is a change.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I tried to call her several times.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: you feeling better? You said you didn’t feel
so good…</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: But after the first call, she would no
longer come to the phone.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I also sent flowers with no luck. I should
not dwell on such things, but set them behind me. The smell of the
flowers only made me sicker. The headaches got worse I think I’ve got
stomach cancer. I should not complain so. "You’re only as healthy as you
feel."</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I realize now how much she is like the
others, so cold and distant. Many people are like that. They’re like a
union.</p>
<p><strong>c.u. travis</strong>: His face is expressionless. The MAN
makes himself comfortable in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>professional passenger</strong>: Jackson Heights.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m off duty.</p>
<p><strong>professional passenger</strong>: You mean you don’t want to
go out to Jackson Heights?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No, I’m off duty.</p>
<p><strong>professional passenger</strong>: Then how come your "Off
Duty" light wasn’t on.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: It was on. it just takes a while to warm up.
Like a TV.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: 471 Central Park West.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: Just pull over to the curb a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: Yeah, that’s fine. Just sit
here.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: Cabbie, ya see that light up there
on the seventh floor, three windows from this side of the building?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: Ya see that woman there?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: That’s my wife. But it ain’t my
apartment. A nigger lives there. She left me two weeks ago. It took me
this long to find out where she went. I’m gonna kill her.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: What do you think of that,
cabbie?</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: Huh? What do you think of that,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: I’m gonna kill her with a .44
Magnum pistol.</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: Did you ever see what a .44 can do
to a woman’s face, cabbie? Did you ever see what it can do to a woman’s
pussy, cabbie?</p>
<p><strong>young passenger</strong>: I’m going to put it right up to
her, cabbie. Right in her, cabbie. You must think I’m real sick, huh? A
real pervert. Sitting here and talking about a woman’s pussy and a .44,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Hey Travis. This here’s Easy Andy. He’s a
travelling salesman.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hello Travis.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: This is fine, Dough-Boy Pay Dough-Boy
here.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: 20 bucks?</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Yeah. Hey thanks. That’s real nice,
Travis.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dough-Boy probably told you I don’t carry any
Saturday Night Specials or crap like that. It’s all out of State, clean,
brand new, top-of- the-line stuff.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You got a .44 Magnum?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s an expensive gun.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I got money.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s a monster. Can stop a car – put a bullet
right into the block. A premium high resale gun. $350 – that’s only a
hundred over list.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I could sell this gun in Harlem for $500 today
- but I just deal high quality goods to high quality people. Now this
may be a little big for practical use, in which case I’d recommend the
.38 Smith and Wesson Special. Fine solid gun - nickel plated.
Snub-nosed, otherwise the same as the service revolver. Now that’ll stop
anything that moves and it’s handy, flexible.</p>
<p>****: </p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The Magnum, you know, that’s only if you want
to splatter it against the wall. The movies have driven up the price of
the Magnum anyway. Everybody wants them now. But the Wesson .38 - only
$250 - and worth every dime of it. Throw in a holster for $10.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith
and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will
still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality. You interested in an
automatic?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That
.22 there.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s the Colt .25 - a fine little gun. Don’t
do a lot of damage, but it’s as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you
can carry it almost anywhere. I’ll throw it in for another $125.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: How much for everything.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The .32’s $150 - and you’re really getting a
good deal now - and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty-five for
four pieces and a holster. He’ll, I’ll give you the holster, we’ll make
it seventy-five and you’ve got a deal - a good one.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: How much to get a permit to carry?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, you’re talking big money now. I’d say at
least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out.
The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not
to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6
G’s, but if I get the permit it’ll be as solid as the Empire State
Building.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Nah, this’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You can’t carry in a cab even with a permit -
so why bother?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Is there a firing range around?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sure, here, take this card, go to this place
and give ’em the card. They’ll charge you, but there won’t be any
hassle.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You in Nam? Can’t help but notice your
jacket?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were
you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then
the next.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s he’ll out there all right. A real
shit-eatin’ war. I’ll say this, though: It’s bringing a lot of fantastic
guns. The market’s flooded. Colt automatics are all over.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: They’d never get me to go back. They’d have
to shoot me first. You got anything to carry these in?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You like ball games?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I can get you front and center. What do you
like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the
Mayor’s box.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Nah. I ain’t interested.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Wait a second, Travis. I’ll walk you out.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: May 29, 1972. I must get in shape. Too much
sitting has ruined my body. Twenty-five push-ups each morning, one
hundred sit-ups, one hundred knee-bends. I have quit smoking.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Total organization is necessary. Every
muscle must be tight.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: My body fights me always. It won’t work, it
won’t sleep, it won’t shit, it won’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>tv disc jockey</strong>: Freshingly, fantastic, freaked-out
dance time. Can you dig it? Dig on it. You got it, flaunt it.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Come on, mister, let’s get outta here –
quick.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Come on, baby, let’s go. This is all a real
drag.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Just forget all about this, cabbie. It’s
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>early morning, 6</strong>: 00 a.m. Quitting time – TRAVIS
pulls into</p>
<p><strong>female movie voice</strong>: Oh, come on, now, down, lick it,
come on… Mmm, that’s good. Ahh, ahh, more …</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: The idea had been growing in my brain …</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: … for some time. True Force. All the king’s
men cannot put it back together again.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v.</strong>: he scans the objects of his room through the
scope of the .38.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Listen you screwheads: Here is a man …</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: … who wouldn’t take it any more, a man who
stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth. Here is …</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: the taxis are roaming the slick streets.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hey ’Melio.</p>
<p><strong>stick-up man</strong>: Come on, man. Quick, quick, quick.
Hand over that bread.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hey dude!</p>
<p><strong>’melio</strong>: Thanks, man. Figured I’d get him on the way
out.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You’re gonna have to cover me on this one,
’Melio. I can’t stay for the cop show.</p>
<p><strong>’melio</strong>: You can’t do that, Travis. You’re my
witness.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: The hell I can’t. It’s no sweat for you.
What is this for you, number five?</p>
<p><strong>’melio</strong>: No, only four. Alright, Travis, I’ll do what
I can.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>direct cut to pornographic movie</strong>: this is the first
time we have actually seen the porno movie itself. </p>
<p><strong>television</strong>: The BOY is visiting the GIRL in her
hospital room. Both look as if they’ve stepped out of the Blue Chip
stamp catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>soap opera boy</strong>: Is it that she just doesn’t – like
me?</p>
<p><strong>soap opera girl</strong>: Well, Jim, it’s just that – I don’t
know how to say this – it’s that she thinks your parents aren’t… good
enough, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Damn, damn.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: You know Eddie, he’s the new hippie kid in
our group, long hair…</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: …he called up the Dispatcher last night.
Charlie McCall, our dispatcher…</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: One-Ball McCall?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: That’s the guy. Eddie calls him up and says,
"Hey, what do you want me to do. I’m over here at Poly Prep. I got a
girl in the back and she doesn’t have the fare. She wants me to come in
back and collect. What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: This is on the two-way with about a
hundred and fifty cars listenin in.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: McCall says. "How much on the meter?" Eddie
comes back and says "Two-fifty." McCall says, "Is she worth it".</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Fuckin One-Ball.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: And the kid says, "Yeah. She’s about 19,
good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"</p>
<p><strong>fourth cabbie</strong>: She should have told him to get an OK
from the front office.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: McCall says, "Well, if you want some help
I’ll see if I can send some units out."</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: Yeah. About a hundred and fifty.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: I hope he had a checker.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: She was just a kid. Stoned, you know.</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: Hiya Killer.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: You’re getting a rep, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: Got the five you owe me, Killer?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: What’s the action around?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Slow.</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: Shit yes. Night woulda been dead if I
hadn’t grabbed an outatowner at Kennedy. Took him roun the horn and got
a five dollar tip to boot.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: One of these days we’re gonna turn you in,
Charlie T. Fleecin the hicks like that.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Remember the time this cat picks up four
dudes from the other side, Pakastanis I think they were, holds up their
passports, to the toll booth collector on the bridge and charges em ten
bucks each for ’crossing the border?</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: Hell, I know’d you to do worse.</p>
<p><strong>dough-boy</strong>: Least I’m no airport rat. I work the
whole town.</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: It’s a living.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, I’m shovin’ on.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hey Wiz, just a second. I wanna talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: See ya, Killer. Don’t forget your pea
shooter.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hey Wiz.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Wiz?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Look, ah, we never talked much, you and
me…</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I wanted to ask you something, on account
you’ve been around so long.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Shoot. They don’t call me the Wizard for
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, I just, you know…</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Things got ya down?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Real down.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: It happens.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Sometimes it gets so I just don’t know what
I’m gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do
somethin.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: The taxi life, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Like do anything, you know.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You
choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I’ve
been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don’t own my own cab.
I guess that’s the way I want it. You see, that must be what I am.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Look, a person does a certain thing and
that’s all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do
you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You’re like a peg
and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around
a while until you fit in.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: That’s just about the dumbest thing I ever
heard, Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I’ve
been a cabbie all my life, what do I know? I don’t even know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Neither do I, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: You fit in. It’s lonely, it’s rough at
first. But you fit in. You got no choice.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Don’t worry, Killer. You’ll be all right. I
seen enough to know.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Betsy, come over here a moment.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What is it? I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just follow me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look there. No, over further - get your glasses
- yes, over there. Isn’t that little guy the same guy that was bugging
you around the office about a month ago?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, I don’t think so. That’s someone
else.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and
chin. See? See there?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Are you a Secret Service Man?</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’ve seen a lot of suspicious- looking
people around here today.</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh, lots. I don’t know where they all are
now. There used to be one standing over there.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service
Man?</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I kinda thought I might make a good one. I’m
very observant.</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I was in the Army too. And I’m good with
crowds.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: he definitely ranks as a suspicious
character. </p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What kind of guns do you guys use?
.38’s?</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Look, um, if you give me your
name and address, we’ll send you the information on how to apply.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You would, huh?</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: My name is Henry Krinkle – that’s with a
"K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New
Jersey. Zip code 07410. Got that?</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Sure, Henry. I got it all. We’ll
send you all the stuff all right.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Great, hey. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: June 11. Eight rallies in six more days. The
time is coming.</p>
<p><strong>c.u. hippie hooker.</strong>: </p>
<p><strong>hippie hooker</strong>: Hey cabbie! You comin’ or goin’?</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: The time has come to put an end to the
things that divide us: racism, poverty, way – and to those persons who
seek to divide us. Never have I seen such a group of high officials from
the President to Senate leaders to Cabinet members…</p>
<p><strong>cut to travis</strong>: no expression. PALANTINE’s words are
barely distinguishable from a block away:</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: … pit black against white, young against
old, sow anger, disunity and suspicion – and all in the name of the
"good of the country." Well, their game is over. All their games are
over. Now is the time to stand up against such foolishness, propaganda
and demagoguery. Now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his
neighbor, for one man to give in order that all might receive. Is unity
and love of common good such a lost thing?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Dear Father and Mother, June is the month, I
remember, which brings not only your wedding anniversary, but also
Father’s Day and Mother’s birthday. I’m sorry I can’t remember the exact
dates, but I hope this card will take care of all of them. I’m sorry I
again can not send you my address like I promised to last year, but the
sensitive nature of my work for the Army demands utmost secrecy. I know
you will understand. I am healthy and well and making lots of money. I
have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be
proud if you could see her.</p>
<p>****: </p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Her name is Betsy, but I can tell you no
more than that.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hey, cabbie, you can’t park here.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Sorry, officer.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You waiting for a fare?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No, officer.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: All right, move it.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I hope this card finds you all well, as it
does me. I hope no one has died. Don’t worry about me. One day there
will be a knock on the door and it will be me.</p>
<p><strong>happy anniversary</strong>: To a Couple</p>
<p><strong>travis’ p.o.v.</strong>: some of the YOUNG STREET GIRLS are
arrogant, almost aggressive, others are more insecure and
inexperienced.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You looking for some action?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well…I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: All right. You see that guy over there? His
name is Sport. Go talk to him. I’ll wait here.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You name Sport?</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Here, officer, take me in. I’m clean. I
didn’t do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That’s all. Honest,
officer.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Your name Sport?</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Anything you say, officer.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m no cop. I want some action.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half
hour.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: No, not me. There’ll be an elderly gent to
take the bread.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Catch you later, Copper.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m no cop.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Well, if you are, it’s entrapment
already.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m hip.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Funny, you don’t look hip.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: This is my room.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Hey cowboy!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: The rod. Gimme the rod, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: This ain’t Dodge City, cowboy. You don’t
need no piece. I’m keepin’ time.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Why you hang around with them greasers?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: A girl needs protection.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah. From the likes of them.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: It’s your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain’t
long. That cigarette burns out, your time is up.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Easy.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: That ain’t much of a name.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: It’s easy to remember. Easy Lay.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What’s your real name?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I don’t like my real name.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What’s your real name?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Iris.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: That’s a nice name.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: That’s what you think.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Don’t you remember me? Button your
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Why? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one
night. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You tried to run away in my taxi but your
friend – Sport – wouldn’t let you.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: It don’t matter. I’m gonna get you outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: We better make it, or Sport’ll get mad. How do
you want to make it?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I don’t want to make it. I came here to get
you out.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You want to make it like this?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Can’t you listen to me? Don’t you want to
get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Why should I want to get out of here? This is
where I live.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: But you’re the one that wanted to get away.
You’re the one that came into my cab.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I musta been stoned.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Do they drug you?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Oh, come off it, man.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Listen…</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Don’t you want to make it? Can’t you make
it?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You can’t make it, can you? I can help
you.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Fuck it! Fuck it!</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You can do it in my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Don’t you understand anything?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You don’t have to make it, mister.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Do you understand why I came here?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I think so. I tried to get into your cab one
night, and now you want to come and take me away.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Don’t you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I can leave anytime I want.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: But that one night?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I was stoned. That’s why they stopped me. When
I’m not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from
myself.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, I tried.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I understand, mister. It means something,
really.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Can I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: That’s not hard to do.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No, I mean really. This is nothing for a
person to do.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Sure. All right. We’ll have breakfast. I get
up about one o’clock. Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well tomorrow noon there’s a… I got a…</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Well, you want to or not?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: O.K. It’s a date. I’ll see you here,
then.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, Iris?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: My name’s Travis.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Thank you, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: So long, Iris. Sweet Iris.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I think this is yours, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Here’s the twenty bucks, old man. You better
damn well spend it right.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Come back anytime you want, cowboy. But
without the rod – please.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Well, at least it wasn’t chicken.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: It wasn’t? I thought it was. It tasted
like chicken.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: C’mon, Senator. That was a class dinner. The
St. Regis is a class joint. That was veal.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: Was it? It sure tasted like chicken to
me. Lately, everything tastes like chicken to me.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Everything? Got to watch your gut.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: What about it? I took 20 off before we
started this thing.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: And you’ve put ten of it back on.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: Ten? I don’t think so. You really think
so? Ten?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Those TV cameras do. I caught the rally on CBS.
You looked a little paunchy.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: I don’t think I gained ten pounds.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: … and after that Sport and I just started
hanging out…</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Where is home?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I got so many sunglasses. I couldn’t live
without my shades, man. I must have twelve pair of shades.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I ain’t ever been there, but it don’t seem
like such a bad place.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Why do you want me to go back to my parents?
They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain’t nothin there.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: But you can’t live like this. It’s hell.
Girls should live at home.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Didn’t you ever hear of women’s lib?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Young girls are supposed to dress up, go to
school, play with boys, you know, that kinda stuff.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: God, you are square.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: At least I don’t walk the streets like a
skunk pussy. I don’t screw and fuck with killers and junkies.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Who’s a killer?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to
me.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: He never killed nobody. He’s a Libra.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I’m a Libra too. That’s why we get along so
well.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: He looks like a killer.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I think Cancer’s make the best lovers. My
whole family are air signs.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: He shoots dope too.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: What makes you so high and mighty? Did you
ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don’t get eyes like that
from…</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: He’s worse than an animal. Jail’s too good
for scum like that.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Rock music died in 1970, that’s what I think.
Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was
crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to
go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars
everywhere. That Airplane–that’s my group, man. All Libras. But now
everybody’s split or got sick or busted. I think I’ll move to one of
those communes in Vermont, you know? That’s where all the smart ones
went. I stayed here.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I never been to a commune. I don’t know. I
saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn’t look very clean to me.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Why don’t you come to a commune with me?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Me? I could never go to a place like
that.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I… I don’t get along with people like
that.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You a scorpion? That’s it. You’re a scorpion.
I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Besides, I’ve got to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’ve got something important to do. I can’t
leave.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: What’s so important?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I can’t say – it’s top secret. I’m doing
something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You a narc?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Do I look like a narc?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: God, I don’t know who’s weirder, you or
me.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: What are you going to do about Sport and
that old bastard?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Just leave’em. There’s plenty of other
girls.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You just gonna leave ’em?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: What should I do? Call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Cops don’t do nothin.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat
me up once.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You can’t leave ’em to do the same to other
girls. You should get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I don’t know. Just should, though. Somebody
should kill ’em. Nobody’d miss ’em.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: God. I know where they should have a commune
for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m sorry, Iris. I didn’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You’re not much with girls, are you?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of
girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all
day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them,
ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them
is not bother them at all. So I don’t say a thing. I pretend I’m not
even there. I figure they’ll understand that and appreciate me for
it.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Do you really think I should go to the
commune?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I think you should go home, but otherwise I
think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away
from here. The city’s a sewer, you gotta get out of it.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Sure you don’t want to come with me?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I can’t. Otherwise, I would.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I sure hate to go alone…</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’ll give you the money to go. I don’t want
you to take any from those guys.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: You don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I want to – what else can I do with my
money? You may not see me again–for a while.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: My work may take me out of New York.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: What’s the matter, baby, don’t you feel
right?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: It’s my stomach. I got the flu.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Oh, baby, there ain’t no flu. You know that,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Honest, Sport.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: You’re just tired, baby. You just need your
man. I am your man, you know. You are my woman. I wouldn’t be nothing
without you.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: I know this may not mean anything to you,
baby, but sometimes I get so emotional, sometimes I think, I wish every
man could have what I have now, that every woman could be loved the way
I love you. I go home and I think what it would be without you, and then
I thank God for you. I think to myself, man, you are so lucky. You got a
woman who loves you, who needs you, a woman who keeps you strong. It’s
just you and me. I’m nothing without you. I can go like this for ever
and ever. We can do it, baby. You and me. Just you and me.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: My whole life has pointed in one direction.
I see that now. There never has been any choice for me.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Loneliness has followed me all my life. The
life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go: in bars, cars, coffee
shops, theaters, stores, sidewalks. There is no escape. I am God’s
lonely man.</p>
<p><strong>matchcut to p.o.v.</strong>: another neighborhood, LATER IN
THE NIGHT. Still in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I am not a fool. I will no longer fool
myself. I will no longer let myself fall apart, become a joke and object
of ridicule. I know there is no longer any hope. I cannot continue this
hollow, empty fight. I must sleep. What hope is there for me?</p>
<p><strong>c.u.</strong>: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the
table. We read it.</p>
<p><strong>timecut</strong>: A SHORT WHILE LATER. TRAVIS has cleaned up
his apartment. Everything is neat and orderly.</p>
<p><strong>slight timecut</strong>: PALANTINE is speaking on the
platform.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: … and with your help we will go on to
victry at the polls Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>palantine</strong>: On to victory in Miami Beach next month
and on to victory next November!</p>
<p><strong>secret service man’s p.o.v.</strong>: TRAVIS, his face
intense, pushes his way through the CROWD.</p>
<p><strong>secret service man</strong>: Detain that man!</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: SPORT stands in his doorway on the LOWER
EAST SIDE shot with LONG DISTANCE LENS. It is EARLY EVENING.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: A pudgy middle-aged white PRIVATE COP
walks up to SPORT. The two men laugh, slap each other on the back and
exchange a soul shake. They discuss a little private business and the
PRIVATE COP walks off in the direction of IRIS’ apartment.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: PRIVATE COP walks down block.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: PRIVATE COP turns up darkened stairway to
IRIS’ apartment.</p>
<p><strong>travis’ p.o.v.</strong>: PEDESTRIAN attempts to flag down
TRAVIS’ taxi, but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees TRAVIS
has no intention of stopping for anything.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: SPORT maintains his post in the dark
doorway. He waves to a GIRL who passes, and she waves back.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hey, Sport. How are things?</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: O.K., cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: How are things in the pimp business, hey
Sport?</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I’m here to see Iris.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Iris?</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Wha – ?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that
name?</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: No. Hillbilly, you’d better get your wise ass
outa here and quick, or you’re gonna be in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: You carry a gun?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: Hey, mister, I don’t know what’s going on
here. This don’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Show it to me.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Now suck on that.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Don’t kill him, Travis! Don’t kill him!</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Pgghew! Pgghew!</p>
<p><strong>visual</strong>: TRACK begins at table and works across the
room to the mattress.</p>
<p><strong>audio</strong>: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a
middle- aged uneducated man reading in voice over.</p>
<p><strong>iris’ father</strong>: Dear Mr. Bickle,</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: A private-owner wanted to swap wheels. Now
my tires were brand new. "Give me a couple days," I says.</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: Howdy Wizard, Killer.</p>
<p><strong>charlie t</strong>: Don’t mess with the Killer.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hey Charlie T.</p>

<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Hello, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Hello, Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: I see where Palantine got the
nomination.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes. It won’t be long now. Seventeen
days.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Well, I hope he wins.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: How are you, Travis? I read about you in the
papers.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really.
The papers always blow these things up. A little stiffness. That’ll go
away. I just sleep more, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: No, no, please. This fare’s on me.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Travis?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Maybe I’ll see you again sometime, huh?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: Sure.</p>
