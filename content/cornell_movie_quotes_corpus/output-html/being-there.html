<p><strong>louise</strong>: … Evening, Chance.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Good evening, Louise.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: … The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m afraid he’s slippin’ a bit with every
hour that goes by…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: … Back up those stairs - damn… That Man’s
needin’ me more and more just before he never needs me again…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Is his back feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: … Gobbledegook… You and your gobbledegook.
You’re gonna be the death of me yet, Chance… … Unless those stairs are…
The Good Lord’s liable to snatch up two unwillin’ souls at the same time
if I keep on trampin’ up those stairs… I don’t want none of that…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Good morning, Louise.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: He’s dead, Chance! The Old Man’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … I see.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Must of happened durin’ the night, I don’t
know… Lord, he wasn’t breathin’ and as cold as a fish. I touched him,
just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that’s doin’ more than I get
paid to do… Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his
head…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I’ve seen that done.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Then I got the hell out of that room and
called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn’t any too
alert. He just said, ‘Yeah, he’s been expectin’ it and said he’d send
somebody over…’ Lord, what a mornin’!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Yes, Louise, it’s snowing in the garden
today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It’s very white.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say?
More gobbledegook? That Old Man’s layin’ up there dead as hell and it
just don’t make any difference to you!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It
happens to old people.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, ain’t that the truth…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh, Lord, Chance - I don’t know what I was
expectin’ from you… I’m sorry for yellin’ like I did… No sir, I just
don’t know what I was expectin’ … … I ’spose I’d better gather up some
breakfast for you…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I’m very hungry.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, no more stewin’ those prunes every
mornin’, that’s somethin’, I guess… … what are you goin’ to do now,
Chance?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I’m going to work in the garden.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: … I’ll get you some eggs.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: … Well, ain’t you the gentleman this
mornin’… … gotta go now, Chance…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You’re gonna need somebody, someone’s gotta
be around for you, boy… … You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance… But I
guess it oughta be an old lady, ’cause you ain’t gonna do a young one
any good, not with that little thing of yours… … You’re always gonna be
a little boy, ain’t you? … Goodbye, Chance…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Goodbye, Louise.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: … He used to be a big man… ‘Spose he wasted
away to about nothin’… to the body of the old … I guess I’ll be goin’
off to find me some folks, Old Man… I’m not batty enough to stay around
this neighborhood any longer…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Wait up! I’m goin’ out that door first.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: … This is another world, Tom - I never would
have believed it…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yeah… He and my father used to ride
together back in the thirties… Fox hunting… Before I was born…</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: … Would you take me on a tour?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Gladly… … The safe is in Mr. Jennings’
bedroom, that’ll be stop number one.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … Why… Hello, we thought we heard
something… I’m Thomas Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Thomas… I’m Chance, the gardener.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … The gardener? … Yes, of course…
Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Mr. Chance, I’m very pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … We’re with Franklin, Jennings and
Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Thomas - I understand.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … Are you waiting for someone? An
appointment?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I’m waiting for my lunch.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Your lunch? You have a luncheon
appointment here?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Louise?… The maid?… But she should have
left earlier today…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … You’ve quite a sense of humor,
Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I live here.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You live here? … We don’t have any record
of that.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It’s very cold outside today, isn’t it,
Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … How long have you been living here?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Ever since I can remember, since I was a
child.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Since you were a child?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have
always worked in the garden.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: … Then you really are a gardener?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Your appearance doesn’t suggest that at all,
Mr. Chance.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Do you have any proof of your employment,
Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or
documents?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: How were you compensated for these duties
you say you performed?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Compensated…?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: How were you paid?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I was given meals, and a home…</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What about money?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I never needed money.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some
identification with your address – a Driver’s License, a credit card,
checkbook?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, I do not have any of those.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Then how about medical records? Could you
give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I
have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house,
and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … Joe? Who’s Joe?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some
repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: 1952…?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I remember when he came. He was very
fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little
book.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Some pictures…?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Of men and women.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: … Oh.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes and the Old Man used to come to my
garden. He would read and rest there.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden
for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he
stopped visiting my garden.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … We shall need some proof of your having
resided here, Mr. Chance.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: You have me, I am here. What more proof do
you need?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Have you served in the Army?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on
television.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must
have paid taxes?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Those trees were very young when I first
arrived.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Are you related to the deceased,
Mr. Chance?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, I don’t think so. And I have planted and
shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my
flowers.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Might you have a birth certificate,
Mr. Chance?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. That’s where Joe fixed the bricks.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Thomas. I have never been in an
automobile.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: You never been in a car?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Well… From time to time I did sit in it…
Just in here… It hasn’t been outside since the Old Man hurt himself. I
live in here.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: The Old Man gave me nice television sets,
this one has remote control. He has one just like it.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have
no information of your having any connection with the deceased.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I am allowed to go to the attic and select
any of the Old Man’s suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take
his shirts, shoes and coats.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: It is quite amazing how those clothes have
come back into style.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I have seen styles on television.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I would like to stay and work in my
garden.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … What do you make of all this?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I really don’t know, Tom - he seems so honest
and simple… In a way, he’s quite charming…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: … It’s very bizarre - I don’t know what to
think…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Well… He’s either very, very bright or
very, very dense - he’s hard to figure… … Let’s just keep everything
legal.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the
truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make
against the deceased’s estate.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I’m fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy
one. There is no need for a claim.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Good. That’s good. Then if you would
please sign a paper to that effect.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Thomas. I don’t know how to sign.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Come now, Mr. Chance.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I have no claim, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: But you won’t sign, correct?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on
dragging this matter on… But I must inform you this house will be closed
tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move
out.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Move out? I don’t understand, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I
will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave… Call me if you
change your mind about signing. C’mon, Sally - let’s grab a bite…</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Good day, Mr. Chance.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Good day, Sally.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Excuse me, would you please tell me where
I could find a garden to work in?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … There is much to be done during the
winter, I must start the seeds for the spring, I must work the soil…</p>
<p><strong>lolo</strong>: What you growin’, man?</p>
<p><strong>abbaz</strong>: … What you doin’ here, boy?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I had to leave my garden. I want to find
another.</p>
<p><strong>abbaz</strong>: Bullshit. Who sent you here, boy? Did that
chickenshit asshole Raphael send you here, boy?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. Thomas Franklin told me that I had to
leave the Old Man’s house, he’s dead now, you know…</p>
<p><strong>abbaz</strong>: Dead, my ass! Now get this, honkie - you go
tell Raphael that I ain’t takin’ no jive from no Western Union
messenger! You tell that asshole, if he got somethin’ to tell me to get
his ass here himself! You got that, boy?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I understand. If I see Raphael I will
tell him.</p>
<p><strong>abbaz</strong>: Now, move, honkie! Before I cut your white
ass!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Of course. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I’m very hungry now. Would you please bring
me my lunch?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I have seen your game! I have watched Elvin
Hayes play it many times! They call him “Big E!”</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Excuse me… … That tree is very sick. It
should be cared for.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yes sir. I’ll report it right away.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. That would be a good thing to do. Good
day.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Good day.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m very sorry, sir… I…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … I can’t move… My leg…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … My Lord…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: This is terrible, sir - I hope you’re not
badly injured…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I’m not badly injured. But my leg is
very sore.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Can you walk? It’s not broken, is it?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: It’s very sore.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Perhaps I should call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: Somebody ought to call the police!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: There’s no need for police, it’s just my
leg.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I don’t think we should call anyone just
yet, it may not even be all that serious.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Let’s have a look, do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Of course. I would like to look.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It’s starting to swell, is it painful?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Won’t you let us do something for you? Your
leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: There’s no need for a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor,
I insist on it. Please, let us take you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I never saw
the man.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, I don’t think it was anyone’s fault,
David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Please, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I’ve never ridden in an automobile.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I assure you, sir, David is a very careful
driver. Please, won’t you let us take you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Yes. You can take me.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … My suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yes sir. I’ll take care of that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I hope you’re comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I am.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: These can be such trying situations everyone
seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course,
they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he’s never
had an accident before.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. He’s a very careful driver.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Why, yes, he is… Is your leg feeling any
better?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: It’s feeling better, but it’s still very
sore.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I see. … Say, would you mind seeing our family
doctor?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Your family doctor?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor
and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal -
why, it might be hours before you are treated…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss
and it will be so much more pleasant for you… David, we’ll just go on
home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Would you care for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I would like to watch television.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh? Certainly…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, by the way - I’m Eve Rand.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: May I ask your name?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: My name is Chance.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I’m a gardener.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh… Mr. Gardiner… Mr. Chauncey Gardiner… You’re
not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Eve. I’m not related to Basil and
Perdita.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh. Well, they’re just a wonderful couple,
we’ve been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Did you lose something?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I lost my remote control.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh… Well, I’m very sorry…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … I’ll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby
examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your
office or wherever you’d prefer… … Is there anything special you would
like to watch?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I like to watch. This is fine.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I can see that it must be very important for
you to stay informed of all the latest events.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I admire that in a person. As for myself, I
find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at
times…</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Good evening, Mrs. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Good evening, Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I shall take the gentleman to the third
floor guest suite, ma’am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Thank you, Greta. I’ll be with Mr. Rand if I’m
needed.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’ll see you after the doctor has a look at
your leg, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I think he should examine my leg.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … I’ve never been in one of these.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: It’s one of Mr. Rand’s. Since he’s been
ill…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Does it have a television?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an
electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: How long do we stay in here?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How long? I don’t know, see what the doctor
says …</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Good evening, Mrs. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … Eve…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I’m out… How are
you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Tired… And I’m getting tired of being so
tired. Other than that, I’m doing very well.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No headaches?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No, it’s been a good day - better than yours,
from what I’ve been told.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You heard?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for
news. I’m sorry you had to go through all that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, it wasn’t all that bad, darling. We were
fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Reasonable? Good, I’d like to meet a
reasonable man. Why don’t you ask this Gardiner to join us for
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Do you feel well enough for that?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Hah!… Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until
I feel better, will I ever meet the man?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Constance! I want new blood tonight, I’m
getting up for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: But, Mr. Rand…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Don’t argue, tell Robert I want new blood! …
Ask him to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: The injection will ease the pain and
swelling, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I understand. I’ve seen it done before.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Now, you’ll barely feel this. It won’t hurt
at all.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: You were wrong, it did hurt.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: But not for long…</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: It’s good that there was no apparent damage
to the bone.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I think so, too.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: However, with injuries such as this, I have
run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn’t too serious at the time,
but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: You can pull your trousers up, now.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, fine.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Just to take the proper precautions,
Mr. Gardiner, I’d recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.
Allenby takes a long look … By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to
ask you something straight out.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Straight out?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of
claim against the Rand’s?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Claim…? … Oh, claim, that’s what Thomas
asked me.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Thomas? Who’s Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thomas Franklin, an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: An attorney?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Then you wish to handle this matter through
your attorneys?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: There’s no need for a claim, the garden is a
healthy one.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Oh, I see… … Well, then… You’re a very
funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Good, keep your weight off that leg,
Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day
or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we
have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care,
unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Fine. Would you like me to speak to your
personal physician?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: I’ll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays,
Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if
you have any discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I will.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Good God, Eve - you’ll freeze out here.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is
Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: A rather large contusion, but I don’t feel
there is any serious damage. I’d like to keep an eye on him, though - I
suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Stay here? Is that necessary?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Not necessary, but preferable. I don’t
think he’ll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of
man.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes, he is different… Not the kind of person
one usually meets in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome
change of pace.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He’s very intense, and internal, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: At times, yes. But that’s not an uncommon
reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a
sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of
days. … Robert… Is there any improvement…?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: No, Eve… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Sometimes when I see Ben I could swear that
he’s getting stronger… Something that he might say, the way he moves, or
a look in his eyes - makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that
he’ll be better soon… It’s just so hard to believe what’s really
happening…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … That is a very small room.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yes sir, I guess that’s true smallest room
in the house.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It seems to be.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital,
Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … I see.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I feel very good in here.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a
little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I like that very much.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: This won’t take long, Mr. Gardiner. Please
hold still when I ask.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Do you know Raphael?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: No sir, I don’t believe I do.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh. I have a message for him.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: A Black man gave me the message.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Well, I still don’t believe I know the
man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner - aplastic
anemia.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Failure of the bone marrow to produce red
blood cells… Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me
comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions… And
what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner
- is that it’s generally a young person’s disease… Here I am, getting on
in years and about to die of a young person’s disease…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. You look very sick.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I am very sick, and, as you can see by all
this paraphernalia, I am very wealthy. I think I would rather be wealthy
and sick than poor and sick.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I understand. I’ve never seen anything like
this on television.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … We’re prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we’re
prisoners of tubes and technology.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … You will join us for dinner, won’t you,
Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I am very hungry.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … So am I, my boy - so am I.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I know exactly what you mean. Today the
businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want
to do is regulate our natural growth! It’s happening across the
country!</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: To everyone, I’m afraid. The Government
controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it,
is being legislated out of existence.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Of course! By kid-lawyers!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Won’t your injury prevent you from attending to
business, Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. It won’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Would you like us to notify anyone for
you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. The Old Man died and Louise left.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh. I’m very sorry. Well, if you have any need
for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Do you need a secretary?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, thank you. My house has been closed.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Oh. When you say ‘Your house has been closed’,
you mean to say that your business was shut down?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Shut down and locked by the
attorneys.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: What’d I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.!
Damn them!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I hope that staying here won’t be an
inconvenience for you.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I like it here.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: That’s good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you
Chauncey?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Chauncey is fine.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: And I’m Ben.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … And please call me Robert.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Robert. I will.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: So tell me, Chauncey, what are your plans
now?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Does this house have a garden?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey,
you will see our gardens.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see. I would like to work in your
garden.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes
enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one’s
troubles.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I am a very good gardener.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent!
Isn’t that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty
soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the
sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family
and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor – yes, indeed, a
productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was
such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own
hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: But I don’t have that any more… … All that’s
left for me now is the room upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young,
you are healthy, for God’s sake don’t give up on yourself! You have to
fight! You can’t let those bastards keep you down! I don’t want to hear
any more from you about the ‘Room Upstairs’. That’s where I’m going
soon.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: It’s a very pleasant room, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Yes, I’m sure it is. That’s what they say,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … I don’t know what you’ve heard about me,
Chauncey, but I’m sure you know everything there is to know. Cigar?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, thank you. No Ben. I don’t know
everything about you.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … No, of course you don’t. Excuse me for being
so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however,
very few are honest enough to admit it.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: That is so true. You’re different,
Chauncey… Quite different than most men.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … You know, Chauncey, there are thousands of
American businessmen, large and small, that share your plight. I’ve been
concerned with the situation for some time now.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: So I’ve been thinking about beginning a
financial assistance program, Chauncey, to help out American businessmen
that have been harassed by inflation, excessive taxation, unions and
other indecencies…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … I’d like to offer the decent ‘Gardeners’ of
the business community a helping hand. After all, they are our strongest
defense against the pollutants who so threaten our basic freedoms and
the well-being of our middle class. Tell me, would you have any thoughts
on such a program?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can
understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to
block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the
idea, I’m sure you’ll have plenty to say in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I could give it some thought, Ben, but my
leg is very sore.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … Oh? Robert, take a look, would you?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Some pain is to be expected… … And I think
what would be best for the two of you is a good night’s rest. … It’s
late, I’m afraid it’s time for my patients to prepare for bed.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers
and our physician!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: … Sorry, sir - I just couldn’t contain
myself… I knew you were going to come out with another one of your jests
about the elevator… Excuse me, sir…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Hmmm… Elevator.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: … Yes sir - elevator!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I
feel about the accident today, but that I’m delighted that you are
staying with us.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Eve - I like this house very
much.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … And Ben is just mad about you - you’ve lifted
his spirits so - it’s just… Well, it’s just a real pleasure having you
with us.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Ben is very ill, Eve - I’ve seen that
before.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes… I know, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I like Ben very much… He reminds me of the
Old Man…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He does…?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Are you going to leave and close the
house when he dies?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Why… No, I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Good night, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Good night, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Did you want a car, sir?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I would like a car.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing
on that leg?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: It’s fine today, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me
be the judge of that. Please, sit in the chair.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: I swear, Chauncey, between you and
Benjamin, I’ve got my hands full… … Say, that is coming along, the
swelling has gone down considerably… … Any pain here?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Robert. But it’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … Benjamin has been hounding me to allow
him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but
obviously, the strain would be impossible… How about here, Chauncey, any
soreness?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hardly any, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Your limousine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … Were you going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … Oh. … My God, I only wish that Benjamin
had your recuperative powers… Anyway, the President offered to sit in
for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He’s due here
soon, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Robert. I know about the President.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … Oh? You’ve heard?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the
President.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: He does, does he?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Why, that’s terrific, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: How do I know when it’s ten o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … It’s five of, you’d best get on in
there.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I would like to walk today.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Hell yes - walk. You’re meeting the
President, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial
Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: … Sir?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: … Did you wish to see someone, sir?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I would like to see Ben.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Chauncey, up and around this morning, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Well, that’s good news, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: You’re looking much better today, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Hah! It’s all make-up, Chauncey… I asked nurse
Teresa to fix me up, I didn’t want the President to think I was going to
die during our talk.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few
know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you’re an
exception, Chauncey - that’s what I admire in you, your marvelous
balance. You don’t stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you’re
a truly peaceful man.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Ben. … The nurse did a very good
job, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>woltz</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>woltz</strong>: Thank you. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Fine, thank you. We have an additional guest
with us today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>woltz</strong>: I see… Okay, let’s go to work.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about
public office… But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute
more as a private citizen… of course, my wealth provided me with
considerable influence, but I’ve tried, believe me, not to misuse that
power… It’s extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of
eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs
of the country… The temptations are strong, and I’ve been labeled a
‘kingmaker’ by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the
people… I have tried to remain honest to myself…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a
similar position, Chauncey… Maybe one day…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Yes… Oh, very good, Lewis, thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: He’s here. Yes, Mrs. Aubrey? Fine. Show the
President to the library, we’ll be along in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: It’s an old habit that goes along with power –
keep them waiting…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Not now, Teresa. I’m seeing the President on
my own two feet.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: But, Mr. Rand…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Shall we go, Chauncey?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Ben. That’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Mrs. Aubrey, have you received the papers on
the Caracas agreement?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Yes, sir. They’re ready for you to
sign.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Excellent. A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I agree, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>woltz</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Woltz, how have you been?</p>
<p><strong>woltz</strong>: Just fine, thank you, sir. And you must be
Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>woltz</strong>: Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Ben!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … Mr. President, how good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: It’s so good to see you too, Ben, you
look terrific!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I’m not convinced of that, Mr. President, but
your visit has raised my spirits…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Well, I’m delighted to be here, my
friend. I’ve missed you. Here, sit down, get off your feet.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Good morning, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Hello.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Mr. President, I’d like you to meet my dear
friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: You look much taller on television,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Oh, really…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: You will find that my house guest does not
bandy words, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Well, Mr. Gardiner, that’s just fine with
me - I’m a man that appreciates a frank discussion… Be seated, please,
Mr. Gardiner…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I will.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance
to…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I just wondered if you had gone over my
speech, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Well?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I
think it’s very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage
of the game.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Well, Ben… I…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I sympathize with your position,
Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the
reaction to such a speech could be chaos.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: That’s too big a risk, I can’t take the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Oh… Hello.</p>
<p><strong>riff</strong>: Good morning. I’m Riff, Secret Service.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … There is no longer any margin for inflation,
it has gone as far as it can, you’ve reached your limits on taxation,
dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see
it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking
point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might
not be possible.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: It’s that serious, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are
we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary
incentives?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: As long as the roots are not severed, all is
well and all will be well in the garden.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … In the garden?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: That is correct. In a garden, growth has its
season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter.
And then spring and summer again…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Spring and summer… Yes, I see… Fall and
winter. Yes, indeed… Could you go through that one more time, please,
Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I think what my most insightful friend is
saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of
nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: …Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must admit, that
is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I’ve heard in a
very, very long time.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Many of us forget that nature and
society are one! Yes, though we have tried to cut ourselves off from
nature, we are still a part of it! Like nature, our economic system
remains, in the long run, stable and rational. And that is why we must
not fear to be at its mercy! is absorbed in looking around the room at
the … I envy your good, solid sense, Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely
what we lack on Capitol Hill. I must be going. Mr. Gardiner, this visit
has been enlightening…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It has.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … You will honor me and my family with a
visit, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I will.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Wonderful, we’ll all look forward to
seeing you. Is Eve around? I’d like to say hello.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No, she flew up to Boston for another charity
event. She’ll be sorry to have missed you.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to
send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you
for your time and thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for
coming to spend time with a dying man.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Now, Ben, I won’t have any of that. Why
don’t you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of
life!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: You’re right, Mr. President I don’t like
feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Take care of yourself, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: You take care too, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Mr. Gardiner…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: He’s a decent fellow, the President, isn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Ben - he is.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: He was quite impressed with your comments,
Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours,
unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I’m glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking
to the President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Kaufman, I’m going to need information on
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner’s background.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Gardiner, yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And put it through on a Code Red - I want
it as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No problem, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … You know, Chauncey, there’s something about
you… You’re direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly.
You don’t play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak
to you frankly… You know what I was talking to you about last night?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance
program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an
undertaking. I’d like you to meet with the members of the Board, we’ll
be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: And, please, Chauncey - don’t rush your
decision. I know you’re not a man to act on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: And now, Chauncey, I’m afraid you must excuse
me - I’m very tired all of a sudden.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I’m sorry that you are so sick, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Your leg must be getting better.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It’s feeling much better now.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Good. I’m glad to hear that. … How did you like
meeting the President?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Fine. He’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes, he is. I’m sorry I didn’t get to see
him.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Chauncey… Last night you mentioned an old
man, that died.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: He was a very wealthy man, he looked after
me since I was young.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, I see… Your mentor, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Mentor…?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn’t mean to pry.
You must have been very close to him.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I was.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m sorry… … And what about Louise? YOU
mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his
maid.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, his maid!… Stupid me, I thought perhaps she
was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, no. She brought me my meals.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Our greenhouse.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, I like that very much.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes, so do we.</p>
<p><strong>president’s voice</strong>: … And there are so many of you
that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial
crisis in this nation’s history. And there are so many of you demanding
that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course. Well, let
me tell you, gentlemen, I have been conducting multiple-level
consultations with members of the Cabinet, House and Senate. I have
conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the
country. And this very morning I had an in-depth discussion with your
founder and Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand and his
close friend and advisor Mr. Chauncey Gardiner…</p>
<p><strong>president’s voice</strong>: … Well, gentlemen, I found this
to be a most rewarding conference… To quote Mr. Gardiner, a most
intuitive man, ‘As long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted
in the national soil, the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny.’</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Excuse us, please.</p>
<p><strong>president’s voice</strong>: Gentlemen, let us not fear the
inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter, instead, let us
anticipate the rapid growth of springtime, let us await the rewards of
summer. As in a garden of the earth, let us learn to accept and
appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when
we pick the fruit.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … I’m… … I’m very grateful that you’re here,
Chauncey… … With us …</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: So am I, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … Eve - this has been an exhausting day for
Ben…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … But he’s…?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: He’s resting comfortably now. There’s no
cause for alarm, yet…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call
for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington
Post.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Would you care to take it, sir?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’ll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with
Mrs. Aubrey…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Eve. You’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … He’s such a sensitive man, so
considerate…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney,
Washington Post.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Sid.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I
know you must be very busy.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I’m not busy.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Then, I’ll be brief. I covered the
President’s speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post
would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments
on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it
very much.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the
President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh… What
exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First
American Financial Corporation?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Of course. But since he is ill I’m taking
the liberty of asking you.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask
Mr. Rand that.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I see. Then one more quick question,
Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our
profile on you - what exactly is your business?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I have nothing more to say.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Typical - no wonder he’s so close to
Rand…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hmmm. Elevator.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Why, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you looking
for someone?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: I can’t find Mr. Gardiner anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: He’s in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: What’s he doing in the basement?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t know, Mrs. Aubrey.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I’ve been looking all
over.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Morton Hull, the producer of ‘This
Evening’ just called.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I have seen that show on
television.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Of course. They would like you to
appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had
to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I would like to be on that show.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aubrey</strong>: Fine. They felt that since you had such
close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice. … Can I
help you? Are you looking for something?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I like this attic very much.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Gentlemen, I quoted this man on
national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of
some reknown.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but
still, we haven’t been able to…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: He’s an advisor and close personal friend
of Rand’s! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact
Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed!
You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying
man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed
history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.
I’ll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have
it at that time. I’ve got to take a leak.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Right, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>perkins</strong>: I believe these garments will be quite
appropriate, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. They are fine.</p>
<p><strong>perkins</strong>: Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I
know you’ll be smashing.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: How is Ben feeling?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He’s tired, Chauncey - but he’s going to watch
you tonight. We’ll both be watching.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: That’s good. I like to watch, too.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know you do - you and your television… … Good
luck, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: … Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The
scuttlebutt is that he’s a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats
on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece
on the man, we’re going to need facts on his background… … Kinney, what
did you come up with?</p>
<p><strong>kinney</strong>: … Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: … Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you
got?</p>
<p><strong>kinney</strong>: … I realize this sounds banal but there is
no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him -
zilch…</p>
<p><strong>hull</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, I’m Morton Hull, the producer of
‘This Evening.’</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Morton.</p>
<p><strong>hull</strong>: Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you
occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited
to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation’s
economic crisis.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>hull</strong>: Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people
will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays
in the last forty years?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It’s a very good show.</p>
<p><strong>hull</strong>: I’m glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>colson</strong>: Here you go, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you. I’m very thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>colson</strong>: Yes, sir - it’s hot under those lights.</p>
<p><strong>hull</strong>: Now, if the host wants to ask you a question,
he’ll raise his left forefinger to his left eyebrow. Then you’ll stop,
and he’ll say something, and then you’ll answer.</p>
<p><strong>colson</strong>: Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, our very distinguished
quest, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner!</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with
us this evening.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I’d like to thank you for filling in on such
short notice for the Vice President.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner,
to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the
President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. That is surprising.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: … Well, your anonymity will be a thing of
the past from now on.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Yes… Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that
I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope
you don’t object to that.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I don’t object.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Fine, then let’s get started. The current
state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to
know if you agree with the President’s view of the economy?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Which view?</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at
the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin
Rand, did he not?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I was there with Ben.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I know that, Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Well, let me rephrase the question; the
President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated
that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow.
Do you go along with this belief?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I know the garden very well. I have
worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its
trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are
trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of
care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong,
and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all
kinds.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: …Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was very well put
indeed, and I feel it was a booster for all of us who do not like to
wallow in complaints or take delight in gloomy predictions.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Gloomy predictions? That insolent son of
a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Let’s make it clear, Mr. Gardiner, it’s your
view that the collapse of the Stock Market, the dramatic increase in
unemployment, you feel that this is just another season, so to speak, in
the garden?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: In a garden, things grow - but first some
things must wither; some trees lose their leaves before they grow new
leaves…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Then they grow thicker and stronger and
taller. Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them. Gardens need a
lot of care and a lot of love.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … And if you give your garden a lot of love,
and if you work very hard and have a lot of patience, in the proper
season you will see it grow to be very beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: It’s that gardener!</p>
<p><strong>johanna</strong>: Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No! He’s a real gardener!</p>
<p><strong>johanna</strong>: He does talk like one, but I think he’s
brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I think your metaphors are quite
interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but, haven’t we seen seasons that have been
devastating to certain countries?</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Such as disasterous winters, prolonged
droughts that have wiped out crops, hurricanes that have all but swept
away island communities? Doesn’t a country need to have someone in
charge that can see it through such crises?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … That bastard…</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Don’t we need a leader capable of guiding us
through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. We need a very good gardener.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Do you feel that we have a ‘Very good
gardener’ in office at this time, Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I realize that might be a difficult question
for you, Mr. Gardiner - but there are a lot of us around the country
that would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, yes. It is possible for one side of the
garden to be flooded, and the other side to be dry…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … Some plants do well in the sun, and others
grow better in the cool of the shade.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … It is the gardener’s responsibility to
take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry. It
is the gardener’s responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the
shade of a high wall…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Gobbledegook! All the time he talked
gobbledegook! An’ it’s for sure a White man’s world in America, hell, I
raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant an’ I’ll say right
now he never learned to read an’ write - no sir! Had no brains at all,
was stuffed with rice puddin’ between the ears! Shortchanged by the Lord
and dumb as a jackass an’ look at him now! Yes, sir - all you gotta be
is white in America an’ you get whatever you want! Just listen to that
boy - gobbledegook!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: … It is the responsibility of the gardener
to adjust to the bad seasons as well as enjoy the good ones. If the
gardener does his job, everything will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Splendid. Just splendid…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Damn, Constance, get in here! You shouldn’t
miss any of this!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I’m becoming quite attached to Chauncey -
quite attached… … And so are you, aren’t you, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Yes, I am, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: That’s good… That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our
audience, I’d say that your words are a most welcome respite from what
we’ve been hearing from others…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I’m sorry to say that our time is running
short, but before we close, I’d like to ask one final question. What
sort of gardener, sir, would you be?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I am a very serious gardener.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Okay, I’ll see you in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>johanna</strong>: … Business, bullshit! Going out in the
middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she’s a damn
fine attorney! I’ve got to talk to her about this Gardiner…</p>
<p><strong>johanna</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Look, Johanna…</p>
<p><strong>johanna</strong>: I said good night!</p>
<p><strong>colson</strong>: Marvelous! Just marvelous, Mr. Gardiner!
What spirit you have, what confidence! Exactly what this country
needs!</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: … Darling… What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>president,</strong>: … I can’t… I just can’t right now… I’m
sorry, dearest… I just can’t…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … It didn’t make any sense to me at all. I
didn’t know what the hell he was talking about…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He wasn’t making a speech to us, Tom - he was
talking to the masses. He was very clever, keeping it at a third grade
level - that’s what they understand…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yeah? Well, I don’t understand what was up
his sleeve when he pulled that stunt with us? What was he doing? And
why?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Who knows…? Maybe the government had
something to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You know, Sally - I really feel like I’ve
been had, and you know what that means, don’t you?… It means that any
political future I had is right down the toilet!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … Jesus, the thought of spending the rest
of my life as an attorney, that is really a downer… And, Christ, Sally,
I almost forgot Johanna is starting to think something’s going on
between…</p>
<p><strong>kinney</strong>: … Sid, be reasonable - I’ve been everywhere,
there’s no place left to check!</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Try again.</p>
<p><strong>kinney</strong>: Sure, try again - where? There’s nothing,
it’s like he never existed!</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Try again.</p>
<p><strong>kinney</strong>: Sid, it’s useless!</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I said - try again.</p>
<p><strong>kinney</strong>: Up yours, Sid. You try again, I quit!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: An outstanding speech, sir.</p>
<p><strong>perkins</strong>: May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. Thank you, Perkins.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … You possess a great gift, Chauncey, of being
natural. And that, my boy, is a rare talent, the true mark of a leader.
You were strong and brave, yet did not moralize. I hope the entire
country was watching you tonight, the entire country…</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave
for me. Turn over, please.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: In a minute, Robert - in a minute… Chauncey, I
would like to ask a favor of you…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Certainly, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Senator Rowley’s widow, Sophie, is hosting an
evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the
Soviet Union… I think it’s rather obvious that Robert won’t allow me to
attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I would like to escort Eve.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Good. Together, the two of you should create
quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Ben, really…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: to Chance - Chance holds … Thank you,
Chauncey… Thank you very much. … All right, Robert, I’m all yours.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … You don’t happen to have a tuxedo in your
suitcase, do you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben’s for you
tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … I have very few friends, Chauncey… And
Benjamin’s friends are all quite a bit older…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Good night, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Good night, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>aides</strong>: Good morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This is not what I requested.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This information goes back three days. I
want the standard file, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Right, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: So…? Where the hell is it?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: We… uh, have been unable to come up with
any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand’s home … and,
uh…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What the hell are you talking about,
Kaufman?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, we do have data from Honeycutt’s
sources, Chief - but it isn’t pertinent.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’d like to hear that data, Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Suits hand-made by a tailor in Chicago in
1918. The tailor went out of business in 1929, then took his own life. …
His shoes were hand-made in 1928. The cobbler has long since been dead.
Underwear, all of the finest cloth, factory destroyed by fire in 1938.
The man carries no identification; no wallet, no driver’s license, no
credit cards. … He carries one item along with him, a fine Swiss
pocket-watch crafted at the turn of the century; so far they have been
unable to ascertain where or when purchase was made. … He has never dyed
his hair. … Computers have analyzed Gardiner’s vocal characteristics; it
is impossible to determine his ethnic background, they feel his accent
may be northeastern, but they will not commit to that. … Fingerprint
check proved negative, no identification possible. … That’s it,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Miss Davis - I’d like my eggs poached
this morning, please.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … So what does all that add up to?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might
be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they
invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American
identity… We, uh…don’t quite know what to make of it yet, sir… But we’ll
keep on top of it, Mr. President - we’ll come up with the answer.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I would appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Eve. I don’t read the papers.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, it seems you’ve been described as one of
the architects of the President’s speech. And your own comments from the
‘This Evening’ show are quoted side by side with the President’s.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I like the President. He is a very nice
man.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know… … So are you, Chauncey … … Do you mind
my being here, like this?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No, Eve. I like you to be here.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … You know, Chauncey… I want us to be… I want
us… You and I to become… close… I want us to become very close, you
know…?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Eve. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … I’m grateful to you, Chauncey… I would have
opened to you with a touch, and you know that… … But you’re so strong -
I can trust myself with you. I’m glad, Chauncey - I’m glad that you
showed so much restraint…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Eve. I’m very glad that you didn’t
open.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know you are, Chauncey… … You conquer a woman
from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the
longing for your love.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. That could be true.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … I guess I may as well be honest about my
feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you… I love you
and I want you… And I know that you know it and I’m grateful that you’ve
decided to wait until… Until…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … I do love you, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, come in, Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben’s tuxedo for
you now.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Mr. Thomas Franklin, please. Is Thomas
Franklin in? Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby, would you please tell
Mr. Franklin that I would like to talk to him? It concerns Chauncey
Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, what did you think of the
Post’s editorial on the President’s speech?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I didn’t read it.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: But air - you must have at least
glanced at it.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I did not glance at it.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times spoke
of your ‘Peculiar brand of optimism,’ what was your reaction to
that?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I did not read that either.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Well, how do you feel about that
phrase, ‘Peculiar brand of optimism?’</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I do not know what it means.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Sorry to persist, air, but it would be
of great interest to me to know what newspapers you do read.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I do not read any newspapers. I watch
TV.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: … Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that you
find television’s coverage of the news superior to that of the
newspapers?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I like to watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what is
probably the most honest admission to come from a public figure in
years. Few men in public life have the courage not to read newspapers
none have the guts to admit it.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’ve never seen anyone handle the media as well
as you, Chauncey. You’re so cool and detached - almost as if you were
born to it.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Mrs. Rand, how good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Mr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And you must be Mr. Gardiner, correct?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the
State Department.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: A pleasure to meet you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Eve, child! How nice of you to come.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hello, Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: And look who you brought with!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner…</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Oh, I’ve been just dying to meet you,
Mr. Gardiner!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Sophia.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Sophie, please - call me Sophie!</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You just have to let me introduce you to
some of the exciting people here… Why, Pat Boone and his daughter may
drop by later!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … How are the kids getting along?</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this
morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, ‘The Secret
Service is getting to be a drag.’ I guess she wants her privacy…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Huh… I’m glad they’re along with her, if
you know what I mean… How about Jack?</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: Well, I think Jack needs some time alone
with you, darling… He’s getting to that age, you know… He really misses
you…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yeah… I’ll have a talk with him as soon
as…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Yes, come in!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new
developments.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Oh? What?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: We have word that the Soviets have put out
a top priority alert for information on Gardiner’s background. So far,
they haven’t come up with a thing - what’s more, as a result of their
eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in
custody at this time.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Good. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers
have put Gardiner under surveillance. We’re around-the clock now, sir -
I’ll keep you posted.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Mrs. Rand. How delightful.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador.
Mrs. Skrapinov.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you to our
guest of honor, His Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov, Ambassador of the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello… His… His…</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr. Chauncey
Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Delighted. Delighted.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: You must sit with us, my friend, we have
much to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: How is my dear friend Benjamin
feeling?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He’s doing as well as could be expected,
Mr. Ambassador. He still speaks of the stimulating discussions he’s had
with you.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Ah, Yes. Please give him my regards.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Come on, Eve. Let’s let the men talk, there
are so many people that have been asking about you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Would you two excuse me for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield
the pleasure of your company to others.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’ll be back soon…</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: I’m sorry we haven’t met sooner,
Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night
and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I’m
not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President. … Tell
me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin’s illness? I did not want
to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Ben is very ill.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Yes, so I’ve heard, a shame… As you know,
we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the
First American Financial Corporation… We are pleased to hear that you
may fill Benjamin’s place should he fail to recover. Be seated, please,
Mr. Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: … Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid
- considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn’t we, the
diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I agree, I think so too.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: To exchange our thoughts - what does a
Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American
know about diplomacy?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: And I have noticed in you a certain
reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An
interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far
from each other, not so far!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: We are not far… … our chairs almost
touch.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed
almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don’t
want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the
other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time,
you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I certainly do.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by
any chance enjoy Krylov’s fables? I ask this because there is something…
there is something Krylovian about you.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Do you think so? Do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: So you know Krylov!</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: So you know your Krylov in Russian, do
you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I
know an educated man when I meet one!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, good.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Yes, it is very good!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name
again, please?</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor!
Vladimar Skrapinov!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I like that name very much.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! How
poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of
the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful
name, my friend!</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if I might.
Everyone wants to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Eve. That would be good.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many
times!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Yes? What have you found?</p>
<p><strong>karpatov</strong>: We have nothing on him, Ambassador
Skrapinov.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one,
understands our language.</p>
<p><strong>karpatov</strong>: Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: What do you mean there is nothing? That’s
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>karpatov</strong>: There is no information available on the
man before he moved into Benjamin Rand’s. It has proven to be such a
difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to
the United States Government.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: But… Where was this man Gardiner before
last week?</p>
<p><strong>karpatov</strong>: Apparently the White House shares our
curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to
our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: I see. Clearly, such interest on their
part is of great political significance.</p>
<p><strong>karpatov</strong>: Clearly, yes comrade.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Hmmm… Take this down. I want this quote
included in the Tass coverage; ‘Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate
discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that “Unless the leaders of
the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer
to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by
rapid social and political changes.”’</p>
<p><strong>karpatov</strong>: Very good, Your Excellency.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: … It’s strictly rumor at this stage, Lyman
- just something in the wind…</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Something rather big in the wind, I’d say.
So whose files were destroyed? The CIA’s or the FBI’s?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I don’t know. Like I said, it’s just rumor
so far, but we should start nosing around, see if we can talk to some
people…</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: … But why? The question is why? Why would
they destroy Gardiner’s files? What is it about his past they are trying
to cover up? … A criminal record? A membership in a subversive
organization? Homosexual, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: … And he told us that he had been living
there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room
in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I… Well, I didn’t really
believe him, of course - but why the act?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: I have no idea…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Another thing that baffles me, Doctor -
what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings,
obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Well, he said it was his, he walked us
through it.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: I see. Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and
Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.
There’s no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be
extremely confidential. So please, not a word.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Of course, Doctor, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Certainly, glad to be of help.</p>
<p><strong>stiegler</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, I’m Ronald Stiegler, of
Harvard Books.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Ronald.</p>
<p><strong>stiegler</strong>: Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been
wondering if you’d consider writing a book for us? Something on your
political philosophy. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I can’t write.</p>
<p><strong>stiegler</strong>: Of course, who can nowadays? I have
trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a
six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research
assistants, proof readers…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I can’t read.</p>
<p><strong>stiegler</strong>: Of course not! No one has the time to
read! One glances at things, watches television…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I like to watch.</p>
<p><strong>stiegler</strong>: Sure you do! No one reads!… Listen, book
publishing isn’t exactly a bed of roses these days…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: What sort of bed is it?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Everything. I said everything and that’s
exactly what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: But, Mr. Rand, the holdings are so
extensive, I would like to be more precise in…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: What could be more precise than
everything…?</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Everything to Mrs. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>townsend</strong>: Right - everything.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: You two don’t have to lecture me on the
complexities of the situation, no one knows that better than myself… But
you must understand that I have an endless faith in Mrs. Rand’s
abilities - I know that she will select the right person for guidance
when she has the need… She has shared my life, gentlemen, she has given
me far more pleasure than any of my so called assets… Life has suddenly
become very simple for me now - I may be older than my years, and you
might think me to be somewhat feeble… But I am still in love, gentlemen,
thank God for that…</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: We could do it now, we can go upstairs. …
Please, it’s time for us. Come upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I like to watch.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it
alone?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I like to watch very much.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well, if that’s what you want, then I want
it too. We can go this way.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I want to tell Eve.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Oh, you can tell her later. She’ll never
miss you in this crowd.</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: … Maybe you should talk to somebody,
darling.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: No, that won’t do any good.</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: … Is it me? Is there something I’ve
done?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Oh, no, sweetheart - it’s not you…</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: It’s your damn job. It never happened
when you were a senator…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: It’s not that, I just…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman’s voice</strong>: Chief, we have a break in the case.
Our man at the Washington Post says they are working on a story that
either the CIA or the FBI destroyed Gardiner’s files before anyone could
get to them.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman’s voice</strong>: I can’t say at this time - neither
agency will admit to a thing.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Okay, get both Directors over here, I’ll
be right down.</p>
<p><strong>dennis’ voice</strong>: Can you see well?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, very well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dennis’ voice</strong>: Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It’s very tiny, but it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>dennis’ voice</strong>: … Are you sure you like it?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, I do, it’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>dennis’ voice</strong>: Really? Really!!!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Do you need a doctor? I could call
Robert…</p>
<p><strong>dennis’ voice</strong>: I don’t want Robert.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>dennis’ voice</strong>: Your foot! Give me your foot!!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you. But my leg is still a little
sore.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Are you sure you’re not ill?</p>
<p><strong>novogrod</strong>: The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is
FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI
files.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: That could be possible…</p>
<p><strong>novogrod</strong>: But we are quite certain, comrade, that
this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction
planning a coup d’etat.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: A coup d’etat! Of course, that was
foreseen by Lenin himself!</p>
<p><strong>novogrod</strong>: That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We
have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that
will soon be taking over the American government.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Big business. I could work with that
faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.</p>
<p><strong>novogrod</strong>: You have proven that already, Comrade
Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of
this man and establishing an early friendship.</p>
<p><strong>skrapinov</strong>: Thank you, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>novogrod</strong>: Let us toast to the success of the
coup.</p>
<p><strong>group toast</strong>: Na zdorov’e!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you
got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Upstairs? Chauncey, you’re always involved in
some sort of discussion…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: He was very ill, I stayed with him for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here
– I feel it a little myself. You’re an angel, my dear - thank God there
are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: I never gave such a directive,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>baldwin</strong>: Nor I, sir - it would be out of the
question.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Gentlemen, I didn’t call you here at such
an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities.
Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we
suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly
inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man’s files been destroyed? Now, I’d
like some answers.</p>
<p><strong>baldwin</strong>: Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are
now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Very well… Can we rule out
inefficiency…?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I see. What about question three? Is it
possible to erase all traces of a man?</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Highly unlikely, sir… In fact, the boys
around the Bureau feel that the only person capable of pulling it off
would be an ex F.B.I. man.</p>
<p><strong>baldwin</strong>: I don’t think that’s entirely true,
Grover.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And what do the boys around Intelligence
think?</p>
<p><strong>baldwin</strong>: Well, Mr. President… They don’t quite know
what to think.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Gentlemen, needless to say, there is
going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective
operations. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I feel so close to you, so safe with you,
Chauncey… … And Benjamin understands that, dearest… He understands and
accepts my feelings for you…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Come in, Chauncey - please come in…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I can sense that you’ve been through a lot,
Chauncey. But one day, when you feel like it, you’ll tell me all about
your life… … But, even if you tell me nothing, even if it’s too painful
for you to reveal your past…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, Chauncey… I do love you so much!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … You don’t want me, Chauncey… You don’t feel
anything for me… Nothing at all…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I just don’t excite you at all… I don’t know
what you want… I don’t know what you like…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: I like to watch.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: To watch…? To watch me…?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I like to watch.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Is that all you want…? … To watch me…?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. It’s very good, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … But I’ve never done… … You mean…? When… When…
When I do it? … When I touch myself…?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, Chauncey…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: One of those little things you don’t know about
me yet, darling - I’m a little shy.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Good night, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No more, Robert… No more needles…</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: It’s not good, Ben - I’m sure you can feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I know, Robert… But, strangely enough, I don’t
feel too bad about now… I feel all right… I guess it’s easier… knowing
Chauncey is here… to take care of things…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No, I don’t want any of that… Please… please,
just get me Mr. Gardiner, Teresa - please… he’ll head it up…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … And I feel so free now, Chauncey. Until I met
you, I never felt acknowledged by a man… … I always had the feeling that
I was just a vessel for a man, someone that he could take hold of,
pierce, and pollute. I was merely an aspect of somebody’s lovemaking. Do
you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows
within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me
free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: That’s very interesting, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Rand would like to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I would like to see Ben.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … Chauncey… Chauncey…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … I’m about to surrender the Horn of Plenty
for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Let me feel the strength in your hand,
Chauncey… Let me feel your strength… Yes, that’s good… I hope, Chauncey
- I hope that you’ll stay with Eve… Take care of her, watch over her,
she’s a delicate flower, Chauncey…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: A flower…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: She cares for you and she needs your help,
Chauncey… there’s much to be looked after…</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I would like to do that.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: … I’ve worked very hard and enjoyed my life…
I’ve known success… and I’ve felt love… My associates, Chauncey - I’ve
talked with them about you… They’re eager to meet you… very eager to
meet you… I’m very fond of you, Chauncey… And I understand Eve… Tell her
that… tell her I’m madly in love with her…</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … He’s gone, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It
happens to old people.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: Yes, I suppose that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Will you be leaving now, Robert?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: In a day or two, yes.</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Eve is going to stay. The house will not be
closed.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … You’ve become quite a close friend of
Eve’s - haven’t you Mr… … Chance…?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I love Eve very much.</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: I see… … And you are really a gardener,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes, Robert - I am. I’ll go tell Eve about
Ben now, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: … Millions of people across the world
have heard of the passing of Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately, only
relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss. To most,
Benjamin Rand was a legend; to those of us gathered here today, Benjamin
was a beloved friend. My personal association with Benjamin dates back
many years, and my memories of our friendship will stay with me
forever.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I initially came in contact with the Rand
name in 1943. 1 was a young lieutenant in the Air Corps, a navigator
flying missions over Europe. That plane that I learned to know so well
was manufactured by the Rand Aeronautics Corporation. Benjamin Rand was
an industrial giant, known to be powerful and uncompromising, and yet,
on a personal level, we have all felt his warmth and humor… … I would
like to share with you a few quotes, and a few feelings from our dear
friend. … ‘I do not regret having political differences with men that I
respect; I do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart.’ …
‘I have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever… But, if I
am to be honest with myself, I must admit that they have no use for me,
either.’ … ‘I was born into a position of extreme wealth, I have spent
many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty - I do not know the
feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the
majority of people in this world. For a man in my position, that is
inexcusable.’ ‘Life is a state of mind.’ … ‘When I was a boy, I was told
that the Lord fashioned us from his own image. That’s when I decided to
manufacture mirrors.’</p>
<p><strong>dudley</strong>: But what do we know of the man? Nothing! We
have no inkling of his past!</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Correct, and that is an asset. A man’s past
can cripple him, his background turns into a swamp and invites
scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>caldwell</strong>: To this time, he hasn’t said anything that
could be used against him.</p>
<p><strong>bennet</strong>: Well, I’m certainly open to the thought - it
would be sheer lunacy to support the President for another term.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: No one will go along with that… Look at the
facts, gentlemen, the response from his appearance on ‘This Evening’ was
overwhelming; he has excited and awakened the people of this country at
a time of despair.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: He’s personable, elusive, yet seemingly
honest. He’s riding a crest of popularity that builds with every
statement. As far as his thinking goes, he appears to be one of us. I
firmly believe, gentlemen, that he is our only chance - Mr. Chauncey
Gardiner!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It was very moving, Bobby - thank you so
much…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We’re all going to miss him, Eve… …
Where’s Mr. Gardiner?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: … He walked off…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey is so sensitive… He was overcome with
grief…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I can certainly understand that…</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: Of course… I’m so sorry for you,
Eve…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Thank you, Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: I’ll call you soon.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Do you think we should look for him?</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: I don’t think so, he should be along
soon…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I wish he were here…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost,
something may have happened, we can’t leave him!</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: You really care for him, don’t you,
Eve?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so
much for Chauncey…</p>
<p><strong>allenby</strong>: I think we’d better go look for him.
David!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: There he is! Chauncey!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Chauncey! Chauncey!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Hello, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, Chauncey…!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, Chauncey, darling… Where have you been? We
thought we’d lost you - we’ve been looking all over!</p>
<p><strong>chance</strong>: Yes. I’ve been looking for you, too,
Eve.</p>
