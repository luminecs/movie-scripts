<p><strong>draft</strong>: May 20, 1997</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: God loves me.</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: But I don’t think he’s too fond of you…</p>
<p><strong>ugly american</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>ugly american</strong>: This is not football…</p>
<p><strong>ugly american</strong>: …Football is three hundred pound
guys, they run way too fucking fast, they got helmets made of kevlar
they use to spear the quarterback into the next life.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You wanna know what football is? It’s hitting
the other guy dirty and then spitting in his face when he’s down.
Football is all things American, and American is A-Number-One the
absolute fucking best there is. That’s what football is… …And that’s not
football.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Football – American football – is a game
for faggots.</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I’m here… No, it was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry I’m late…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What makes you think we’re here to meet
you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who else would you be?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Perhaps the police?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know cops – and you’re no cop.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He trusts you to lock up?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s just say he knows who I am.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Anybody wanna tell me what we’re waiting
for?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: The question isn’t what we’re waiting for…
it’s who.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And who the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Whoever hired us.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I got this gig through a contractor. And he
most definitely didn’t know who was doing the hiring, only that they
were paying a lot of money…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So none of us knows who’s paying the freight,
this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we’re working for
different people.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Now that is an interesting proposition.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Because if there’s more than one party
involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps
some of us are on different sides. Your orders might be different from
mine.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’re you talking about, man? I don’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: What a surprise…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I got a surprise for you, blondie…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Why don’t both of you shut up?</p>
<p><strong>larry &amp; swede</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Knock it off!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The point remains: we could be working for
different people. There’s a chance for one of us… Maybe more than one of
us – has been paid to cross the others. I don’t know about you guys, but
I like to know who I’m working for. It can help prevent a great deal of…
…unpleasantness.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Anybody tries to unpleasant me I’ll put two
between his eyes – one to do the job and the other to make sure it
takes.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: It’s good to see you’ve all got such faith
in our little undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: The name is Deirdre, and I’m running this
show.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Who are you? IRA?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Not likely. Once, yeah, I was – but there
wasn’t an inch of profit in it, and I’m a cash oriented girl, if you
take my meaning. I’m a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that’s
all any of us needs to know about the other.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: From here on in you want something you pay
cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent
up front, the rest when the job is done. You. What do you do and what
should we call you?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: These days they they call me Gregor – and
I’m a tech. I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sam. I’m a weapons guy.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You were a soldier, were you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Once.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I drive – and my name is Larry. Larry from
the States.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m Vincent. And I coordinate.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Coordinate what?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Things. This is my country, you know.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Coordinate all you want, but make sure
whatever you do gets cleared through me. Are we in sync on this,
Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: They call me Swede.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Who’s they?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Everybody.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And what is it you do?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Me? I kill.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You shoot alright.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Gets the job done.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: All in the stomach, though. Your man might
live.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not for long.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Long enough to shoot back.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s been known to happen.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why don’t you go do better, then…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yeah, well… My way works too.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My way is better.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Is it alright?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: It’s quite satifactory.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Good, because it cost enough. There’s
cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I intend to. This phone is wired like no
other: it’s got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition,
it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. With
my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target’s cell phone
signature and follow him anywhere he goes…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I’d stake my reputation.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: But would you stake your life, that’s the
question…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: In this business, your life and your
reputation are more often than not one and the same.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: You should watch what you eat.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Who the fuck died and appointed you food
czar?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: I’m just worried about your health, Larry.
You could stand to shed a few pounds.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And you could stand to get a little smarter,
ain’t that right you dumb blonde fuck?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Who you calling dumb, dickless?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Next one of you fuckers plays this game I’m
going to do for you myself. I won’t say it again: we don’t have time for
this shit! There’s a clock running on this job, gentlemen, and I mean to
be on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s go for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: To see a man about a thing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Who gave you permission to park here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Pretty much what you’d expect.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: There’s a charge for parking on our
block.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He says this is their block.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: As in, they own it?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Something like that…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And I suppose he’s saying that we oughta give
them something for using it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I didn’t know that you spoke French.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t. But the language he’s speaking is
universal.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I guess we oughta give them something…</p>
<p><strong>cut back to</strong>: Vincent and Sam.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: If you think we should.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh man, I am sorry about that… Let me give you
a hand.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’d you say to him?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I asked if we could give him anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That was a nice move you did on our young
friend. Judo?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jujitsu.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Same thing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not at all. Similar, but not the same.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: One’s a lot more painful than the other.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Could I get one of those?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Help yourself. Since when do you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I have, I don’t know, maybe a cigarette a
week.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a
week, who smokes like that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day,
and I tell myself I could be worse. It’s just so damned pleasurable.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It has it’s moments. Course, you get cancer and
die, that’s the down side.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: There is that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?
Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and
look threatening. A tough guy.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Like Larry or Swede.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Exactly. Why not bring them?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s just say I thought the conversational
possibilities were limited. Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but
he didn’t seem like the right candidate – for this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Watch that one, he’s an ex-spook for sure,
maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He’s smart, Gregor is.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So is the woman.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Deirdre? Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I wonder if she truly left the IRA.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve wondered that myself. None of this answers
my question, though… Why bring me?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I wanted to see who you were.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You were once some kind of special forces.
Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL. After that you rode shotgun for the
CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.
Only now – now you’re like the rest of us, it’s a very competitive
market since the end of the cold war. There’s a lot of hired guns out
here, and not nearly enough work to go around.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s right: there’s not hardly enough work
these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. Then along comes
this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn’t afford not to take
it. Somebody’s paying through the nose for this.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: They certainly are. Whatever it is we’re
going to steal, it must be quite something.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whatever it is it must be goddamned
priceless.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Lovely, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They’d have to keep something like this under
lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: That’s good right where you are,
Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: Not so fast. Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He’s company.</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: Bad company…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: He’s a cop, Vincent, he’s French and he’s
a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I just wanted to see something.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: He wanted to see how you reacted when I
said that you were a cop.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You told him I was a cop?</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: He asked me to say it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He asked you to?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I needed to know.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Here’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: There’s been a slight problem.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: If you say a word in English, Vincent, my
friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the
throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want
might get me killed if I give it to you, and that’s a price I’m not
willing to pay.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I take it you still want the money…</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s pov</strong>: Looking at Vincent and Francois.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Where’s my information?</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: In here…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Then you better find it in your heart to
tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still
isn’t decided how painful it’s going to be.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Now would be a good time to get the fuck out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You know, what you pulled back there, that was
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I needed to see if you were a cop. I’m a
popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they
always do it with an inside guy – some man on some job who seems more
trustworthy than all the others put together. And that’s the guy you
have to watch out for. I hate cops…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well I ain’t a cop.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That there was a gun pointed at me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I saw you look off when Francois nodded his
head. I figured he wasn’t pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and
the rest was easy.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: But how did you know I would have the
presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Because that’s what I would have done…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You saved my life back there in the park. I
know this doesn’t begin to make it right between us…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What I did back in the park I did because we’re
working together – we’re on the same team. This is business – this is
work. We did it together, we share the spoils, even split.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I owe you a heavy debt.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: What’d you do with the money?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We kept it…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hazard pay…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: The two of you were supposed to go to a
simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and
instead you went to fucking war…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We weren’t real thrilled about it either…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So what’s the deal?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: The deal? The deal is we leave for Nice at
first light.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’d you guys do?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I feel as if I’ve wandered onto the set of
Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I didn’t think to see you again tonight. You
were pretty pissed.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I still am.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Part of me says I should just look at this as a
perk. You know, a bonus. But then I remember you’re you – Deirdre who
used to belong to the IRA – and it occurs to me that deceit and
subterfuge come very naturally to you.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Nobody’s saying they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And when I consider that, I have to wonder if
you don’t have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right
now.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I probably do. But for the time being, I’m
willing to forget about it…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I would imagine that the great satisfaction
in all of this will be killing the American.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: I hadn’t thought about it. Understand me,
Gregor – I take no pleasure in killing. It doesn’t bother me one bit,
but I don’t get off on it.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: A means to an end, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Then I guess we’re set.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: There is one other thing…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Don’t cross me…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Nobody’s going to do that!</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I need you, Swede, I can’t do this without
you!</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: I just wanted to make sure you knew who you
were dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I do, I do…</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Just remember it, then.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Look, Sam, don’t take it the wrong way when
I tell you we won’t be doing this again.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t have to explain yourself to me,
Deirdre.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I know I don’t have to, Sam, it’s just
that, for once, I want to. when I was a - Patriot, it was a given I’d
sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. You
know: any man who needed setting up. Sometimes so we might blackmail
him, sometimes so he could be killed. Sometimes so I could kill him
myself. IRA isn’t exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam. To
most of the men I with I was always the girl. “Send the girl to do it.”
“Tell The girl to take care of it.” “Have the girl fuck him.” But I look
at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no
less.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re a hired gun, Deirdre – just like me.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Exactly. And last night I wanted to be with
someone who was just like me.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I better be getting that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Duty calls?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Just business.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Now then, let’s run through it one more
time, shall we? What’s your job?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I use my cell phone to get computer access
to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. I trace his cell
phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through
Nice, relaying that information to you.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You call me with the target’s route, I follow
along until we’ve reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass
off the road.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Which leads us to…</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: I ride with fat-boy…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Eat shit and die slowly…</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: After we stop the target car I get out and
use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I blast the lead car into oblivion…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: While Sam and I take out the back two
cars…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Leaving…</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: …Leaving me to step in, drop the target in
the back seat, and get the package…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: While…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: …While I back him up, making sure to get the
package if something goes wrong and somebody takes Swede down.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Nobody’s taking me anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: And then…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Then Swede and I split with the package and
meet you back at the rendezvous.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: And then…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever’s
left to be cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Very good. Now all we have to do is live
long enough to get paid.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Alright, Gregor, I’m…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Ready when you are…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Where is this broad?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: You should learn a little patience.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: It’s consider a virtue in some corners of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not in mine.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Hello gentlemen, are we ready?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You want to take a left, then, so that
you’re going west.</p>
<p><strong>the target</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: I don’t particularly like killing, tubby, but
I want you to know that this one I’m going to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He just…I don’t believe that son-of- a…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We’ve been crossed…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s a cocktail. Mostly demerol, cut with a
little crank because we might need you awake in the real near
future.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I
don’t care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting
it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of
money when we do. I don’t know about the rest of you guys, but I’m not
the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass. I don’t mean
that in, like, a literal way…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Finding this package is a thing easier said
than done. We don’t even know what it is. What did we steal?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: When this whole thing started you made it
clear: you’re running the show. And I don’t believe you’d be running
this show if you didn’t know what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Well I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And I don’t believe you…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but
you’ll be dead before I hit the ground.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t want you dead, woman, I want the
the truth!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Both of you…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: …put your guns down and chill out.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Like it or now, we’re on the same side: we’re
here and the package isn’t. You’re not the boss any more, you’re our
partner. So tell us what you know, so we can figure a way out of this
mess.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Now, what did we steal?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I don’t know… Well I don’t! It’s a
goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you. But I do know who we’re
working for. My people, and the Russian mob.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Your people? Who the fuck is your people?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Who do you think, Larry? The IRA.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: And you believed me? But it wasn’t my
people who did it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How do we know that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Because if they had she’d be gone along with
the package, instead of sitting here with us.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Exactly. Gregor, he was the Russian’s man.
It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians
who had the capital to finance it. Gregor, he was their insurance, and I
was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral. Gregor must’ve got
to Swede…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I never did trust that blonde fuck…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: That’s why you were riding with him.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: The question still remains: what do we do
now?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gregor’s cell phone…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What are you gonna do, call him up and ask
him to give us back our shit?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did he bring that with him?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I bought it for him – all the stuff he was
using, it was in his contract. Cost a nice penny, too, especially that
goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Check this out. Gregor’s a spook, or he was one
until recently. When he was a spy he lived the life – you know, a prince
in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had
everything. Then the wall goes down. No more Cold War. And Gregor is out
of a job. No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video
tapes. I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and
he doesn’t want to give it up. And I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s
arrogant enough to think…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: That we’re too stupid to trace his
calls.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: It’s a beautiful street, no?</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: Do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Always in a rush, you are. All these years
I’ve known you, you could never wait for anything.</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: This is important.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Do you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: You know it is.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Relax!</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Look over there.</p>
<p><strong>gregor &amp; the gent’s pov: through the windshield - a group
of</strong>: CHILDREN are playing.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Do you see that one? The girl in the light
blue dress?</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: What are you doing, have you lost your
mind?!?</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: To make a point. I don’t know her, and I was
ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk. I don’t particularly
like you, so imagine what I’ll do if you try anything…</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: Enough! We’ve been driving for an hour,
where is my package?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: It’s under your seat.</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: As my American friend Larry would say: are
you fucking deaf? It’s under your seat.</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: I can’t believe you’d do that, Gregor.
I thought I trained you better than that.</p>
<p><strong>dapper gent</strong>: I’ve never particularly liked you
either, Gregor.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Is it done?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Gregor, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Much to your disappointment, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: It was a mistake, it shouldn’t have
happened.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I’m in the middle of saving you people a
great deal of money – the least you could do is have the decency to pay
me!</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: What I do is none of your concern. What you
should do is wait for my next phone call. I’m going to find a place
where I can tilt the field in my favor. When I’m ready, I’ll call you
and tell you what I want you to do.</p>
<p><strong>the bathroom</strong>: pitch black. He moves in, swipes the
string of the overhead light and - nothing. Nobody’s here. The only
place left is the front door, and now Vincent approaches. He opens the
door, gun still at ready, and moves out into -</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You weren’t around when I woke up, I
thought maybe something had happened. This has been one very fucked up
job, Sam, and I’m not taking any more chances on anybody… Including
you…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I came up here to sneak a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You were smoking?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I hope you don’t mind I took your pack. It was
on the table.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Please, help yourself. Smoke as many you’d
like.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I borrowed that, too…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Of course…whenever you feel like it just
help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I have a feeling I’m about to start buying my
own.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That was a bad bit of business, today.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It was at that.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A lot of people died.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve seen a lot of people die before.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I haven’t. Not like that. How do you get
used to it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t. You just learn to live with it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I won’t lie – there have been times when I
had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that
the other man didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We live in a singular world, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I never really thought I was part of the
world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I’m a hood, a thief. Big
time in a small time king of way. To the local police I’m a prize, to
the local hoods I’m a legend. But to a guy like you I’m just another two
bit hired gun.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a
feeling you cost more than two bits.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Christ, I was starting to think that the
two of you had thrown it in and walked away. There’s someone on the
phone downstairs asking for you, and my somewhat limited French leads me
to believe that he might have something to tell us about Gregor.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m telling you…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That I could be dead and I’d drive better
than you.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Oh shut up…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He’s going north. That’s Aix en Provence,
where he used the phone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s going back.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Not necessarily. He could go off road at
any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s Paris. The route’s too indirect for
anything else. A guy like Gregor, he doesn’t waste time on this road
unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he’d be out of
the country by now. He’s going to Paris. Now I just hope we can find him
before he gets there.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: If somebody else doesn’t find him
first.</p>
<p><strong>a table of american tourists</strong>: a Family. Dad is angry
at Mom.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Opera? This is an opera festival?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I told you that, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera. You
know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: This…this is incredible. Is the rest of
Europe like this?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Some places, not all. Italy, for instance,
they’re serious about their food. But try bloody Britain, anywhere in
the U.K., you don’t get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg. Food’s
not our thing, you see.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Best beer in the world known to man or
God.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Best beer in the world? Budweiser for me,
thanks.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Budweiser? You talk to me of beer and
you’ve the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?
That’s not beer! Christ, it’s not even a poor excuse for rabbit
piss.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I drink what every civilized man, woman and
child in the world drinks: Guinness.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I hate to interrupt a conversation of such
cultural depth…</p>
<p><strong>cut away to reveal</strong>: Vincent -</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …but we’ve got to get back on the road.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We’ve got him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I know those men.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when your
partners come back out, you make sure you’re here with the motor
running.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Thank you, gentleman, that will do
nicely.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Edvard, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: Yes, Gregor, they sent me.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I’m touched, really, that they’d send
someone of your caliber. It’s nice to know that they didn’t make the
mistake of underestimating me twice.</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: That was a mistake, trying to kill you.
Mikhi did it without consulting me, I’d have never allowed it.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I’m sure. But I’m sorry to say that it’s too
late for trust: we have a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: We’ll double your price.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Really? Do you have the money with you?</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: Do you have the material?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: You first, Edvard.</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: Perhaps we could both go at the same
time…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I think not. After you…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: After you, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You might have been one mean technical spook,
Gregor, but you wouldn’t have lasted a week in the field.</p>
<p><strong>cut to the gunmen’s pov</strong>: Looking into the Tunnel -
It’s dark, they can’t see a thing, but they’ve heard Sam’s voice and
they know something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: Gregor, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Gregor’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>cut away to reveal</strong>: Deirdre -</p>
<p><strong>deidre</strong>: …but I think you’re in a bit of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Don’t even think it.</p>
<p><strong>cut away to reveal</strong>: Vincent - And his piece is also
out – the Gunmen are trapped, and they know it. Now we notice that - The
Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards us. Meanwhile, back
in -</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t talk to me unless you tell me what I want
to hear, understand?!? You have no choice in this, don’t think about
winning, think about staying alive. I want the item, and if you don’t
give it to me, I’m gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I don’t have it with me…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I swear…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Then where is it?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I sent it to myself in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sent it where?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: A post office box.</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: Do you know who he is? He’s with Interpol,
the Internation Police. He’s a cop.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’re a cop…you’re a fucking cop…I should
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: If you want to live you’ll do exactly as I
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: Where do I know you from?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Vienna.</p>
<p><strong>edvard</strong>: Of course…I remember. I quite liked you, I’m
sorry to have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch would
have sufficed, Seamus, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That double-crossing bitch.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That makes twice now you’ve saved my
life.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I didn’t save your life back there. Risked it,
maybe – but I didn’t save shit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You see it your way, I’ll see it mine. You
need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You know one around here? Somebody you
trust?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No…I thought I’d take you to the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No hospitals. I’ll fix this myself if I have
to.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Fix it yourself? Why are we even doing
this? There’s no need to run, Christ… You’re a cop.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’re with Interpol – you’re a cop.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: If I was a cop, a real cop, I’d have busted you
a long time ago. This isn’t about you, it’s about the job I have to
do.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And what job is that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My job, Vincent, a job you don’t need to know
about. I can’t go to the local cops – they’d never be able to get close
enough at this point. It’s me or nobody, and I’ve been on this job too
goddamned long not to finish.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It looks to me like we’re all that’s left
of our group.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent,
just me.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This doesn’t involve you, don’t you understand?
I can’t even guarantee you any money out of all this.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It isn’t about money for me, not
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: When we’re done with this, I want to do for
that one myself.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Now there’s the Deirdre I know.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: And what’s that supposed to mean, Seamus
Reilly?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: It means I was worried that all the time you
spent away from the fold might have affected you. You’ve been living the
life of the hired gun – the well paid hired gun, I might note. There’s
no glory to it, but there are those that like it.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: So you thought that maybe I’d grown too
attached to this charade I’ve been playing, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: It’s been known to happen.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Not to me, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I thought I did.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I guess you don’t know me, then, if you
think I won’t kill you for an insult like that!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Just testing, lass. Forgive me, but I had to
do it.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when we
get home, I don’t play “the girl” again.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hello, Jean-Pierre.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Hello, my friend. He doesn’t look
French to me, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: American.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Well, Vincent’s American friend, shall
we see what we can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s right there, beneath the surface. I
can just make it out.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Are you sure you won’t have a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No booze…Pain’s in the mind, and the mind I can
control. Alright, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Douse the wound with alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Take that sponge and wipe away as much of the
blood as you can, keep it clean so I can see.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Take the clamp…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Alright, it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You see the bullet?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Clearly.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Good. Now take the forceps, and remember,
Vincent, what we’re doing here is routine. I’ve done stuff like this at
least twenty times in the field. There are no vital organs where you’re
working, no major muscles or arteries – you can’t kill me. Just make
sure you’ve got the bullet before you try to pull it out.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A souvenir…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You think you can stitch me up on you own?</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Then if you don’t mind… I’m gonna pass out.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: He’s tough, your American friend.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yes, Sam’s tough alright.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: And you respect him.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Of course. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: I’ve never seen a man who could have
taken what he just went through. He’s a cop?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So
he saved your life, then?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: If he hadn’t you’d have put a bullet in
his head a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: You’re feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Some, thanks. Enough to move on, for now.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: You should really let a doctor look at
that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: But first you have something to take
care of?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Something important? A thing that
cannot wait?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It gets done now or not at all. Another couple
of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can’t get them.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Forgive my intrusion into your affairs,
but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you
will. He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much
like the debt I suspect he owes you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Vincent doesn’t owe me a thing.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: He sees this differently, as you well
know.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I didn’t expect that he would.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: You suffered through an agonizing pain
last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent
of the law.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Vincent told you that I’m a cop?</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Not a word. But no ordinary criminal
would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do. And so I
place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.
You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my
world, that makes you a cop.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So this is what, a test?</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Call it a reckoning of character.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: If I was healthy, I could take that away from
you.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Perhaps. But you are not healthy, and
if you try I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>quick cut to</strong>: Vincent - Who stands inside the house,
out of sight, but not out of ear shot. He’s listening to everything, and
we notice that Vincent has taken out his own gun.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So what is it you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: I suppose I want to know how a man like
you is created.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Created?</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Perhaps forged is a better word. Like
steel. Like a sword. You’re a modern Samurai. I’ve spent my life around
extraordinary men – men like Vincent. But I’ve never seen anyone like
you. I’m afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Vincent’s life is his own burden; he’ll have to
carry it for himself. And I’m not any kind of Samurai.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: You seem one to me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code
of Bushido, the way of the warrior. I’m just a killer for hire. The
world isn’t about honor, anymore. It’s about survival.</p>
<p><strong>jean-pierre</strong>: Survival. I suppose that’s as good a
cause as any.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Where’s the case?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: There’s a problem…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Problem my ass! I think you’re lying to me,
and if you are you’re a dead man!</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Would somebody tell me what fucking well
happened in there?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: The package didn’t come. I’m sure it will
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: If you’re lying to me you poor excuse for a
human being, I’m gonna blow your brains all over this car.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I swear, it has to come here! It has to…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Ease up, man…I’m just checking to make sure
you’re on the level.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: And it seems to me I saw a sign in there
that says they got a late afternoon delivery. Why don’t we come back
later today and do this all over again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey, man, they’re both great movies. One is
more of a character study, the other is more of a straight action thing,
but they’re great movies, and he’s an amazing fucking filmmaker.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: My man, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m alright. And you?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Doing well. This is?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A friend. I was telling him about how you
always have the latest tapes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Why don’t we step into my office…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: So what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I was wondering if you had any movies that
were particularly new.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Matter of face there’s this flick I’ve been
hearing about. I haven’t seen it, but from what I hear it’s pretty
cool.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s an international thing. Several different
peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought
together to do a job. But maybe the most interesting thing about it is
that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed
together. An unlikely group of partners.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do you have the tape?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I might know where you could get a copy.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Let me do some business with my boy here, and
I’ll meet you across the street in five. I gotta make homes here feel
like he’s getting a good deal while I give him the pleasure of
overpaying me for a couple of second generation pirates.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What I’ve heard so far, it’s all a lot of
talk. I wasn’t so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said,
the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You said you might know where we can get a
copy of this tape?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: All depends on whether you want the Russian or
the Gaelic language version.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gaelic.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Can you get it?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: The Russian would be easier.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Cause the Russian production company would be
easier to find.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s the Irish tape we want.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Gonna be tough.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Last I heard there was a film rep for the
Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Seamus Reilly.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know of him.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Seamus Reilly, boy’s a serious Irish Auteur –
a real firebrand. Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have
turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I’m
saying.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I get the picture.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tony and I have to talk some business,
first.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan
about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s a matter of respect. Why don’t you
wait outside, this won’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The Irish representative?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: The address of the Russian production
company. Just in case we need to find them.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thorough man.</p>
<p><strong>an apartment house</strong>: 35 Rue de Glacon. We PUSH IN on
the -</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You sure your friend got the right place?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: If Tony says this is it, then it’s it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Continue when it would be so much easier to
give it up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Then quit. You don’t work for Interpol,
Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy –
that’s what he said, what Edvard said.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s a cover, then. A cover within a cover,
a feint within a feint. You work for the CIA, it’s the only possible
answer.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m a field agent – last of an already extinct
breed. I do dark ops.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Dark ops?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping.
Assassination.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Very ugly.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It is at that.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Not very zen of you, huh? Not so much the
modern Samurai after all.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I never made that claim.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I know. Jean-Pierre did.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You were behind the door?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I was waiting to see what would happen. I
didn’t want to kill him if I didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You would have done that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I would have tried not to. But yes, if it
would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How could you have done that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Because I owe you. Look at that…</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits
the apartment building.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: All things come to those who wait.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They don’t have the package.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You said it yourself: Gregor’s not dead. If
they had the package, they’d have killed him.</p>
<p><strong>vincent &amp; sam</strong>: They’re going to get it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t do it…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Well, if it isn’t Mr. Interpol himself. I
can’t believe I misjudged you like I did.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh please..you’re on some sort of holy
mission?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I’m a patriate.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t even think that I’m buying that.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Where do you get off saying word one? All
the time pretending to be one of us, it’s the same thing we were doing,
Seamus and myself. And here you are so high and mighty, like you’re so
different from the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I didn’t say I was.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Bloody fucking hell…</p>
<p><strong>cut away to</strong>: Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post
office. By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor. Unseen by
these two men - Vincent is approaching from the side, on an intercept
course, his hand inside a bag which he carries with him. Now - Deirdre
turns and shoots Sam a look. He’s still watching her keenly, and we can
see that she’s aching to reach for her piece, but she can’t because Sam
is still on her like a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t even think it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’d kill you before you had it halfway out.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Put your seatbelt on.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What the fuck happened?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You don’t know? Bullshit, you had her,
there was no way out.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: What in bloody hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: They’re part of the team. One of them’s the
guy I told you about.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: From Interpol?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why didn’t you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Why didn’t you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You slept with her!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: How is it these fellahs managed to get the
drop on us?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I told you: they’re good…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You slept with her!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: You should have kill him when you had the
chance. But no…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You put everything on the line because
you…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: You slept with the fucker!!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Left left left!!!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: This better be the real thing or you’re a
dead man!</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: It is, I’m telling you it is!!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: You’ve told me a lot of things, boyo…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Lose them!</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You lose them!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: To the right!!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Give me a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Right now?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why are you driving? You’re not French, you
don’t live here, you don’t know these roads. Why are you driving?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: About time!</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Not yet…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Good Christ! Can’t you lose these
jokers?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: They’re good!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nice place.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m not here very much.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Business keeps you on the road?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know I don’t need to say this to you, but I
need to say it to you. This is my job, I have to do it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So I do it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No you don’t, and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: If our positions were reversed, would you
leave me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: In a minute.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I think not.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do we need anything else?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah. We need out fucking heads examined.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You better be careful, Seamus, before
something happens a plastic surgeon can’t fix.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Plastic fucking surgeon? You think I’m going
to fix this, Deirdre lass? It’s the mark of the patriot, and I’ll wear
it like a badge. As for those who done it to me, I’ll take my pound of
flesh before this is all over.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You’re thinking with your gun, Seamus, and
not your head…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Shut up!!! Shut up and drive! I’m your
superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that
understood?!?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Do I need to repeat myself?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: No, Seamus. I heard you the first time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not here. They might see it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: If I’m going to die for the CIA, I’m going
to go out smoking. Besides, there’s half a forest between us and them,
they can’t see a goddamned thing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Time to quit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not just like that… Just before I turn around
and it’s six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in
the morning is light a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What of it? Samurai pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Would you stop with that…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why? You’ve got more force of will than
anyone I’ve ever seen. You handle a gun like it’s a part of you, you
perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia… And most amazing of all,
you quit smoking, just like that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The mark of a true Samurai. What I do for the
Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do. We’re both hired
guns, and this is a job – like any other job.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why then, Sam, don’t you act like this is a
job like any other? Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that
some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came
for.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Because I don’t walk away.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s the one thing I’ve got left to hold onto.
Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Closest and oldest.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And yet you would have killed him to save my
life. You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can’t even remember
anymore. I don’t know that I ever even had it to begin with. All I know
to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And when you finish? What then? This
package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA? Do you really think
they deserve it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s a good question.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do you have a good answer?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mikhi</strong>: Sit, sit… Would you like one?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: No, Mikhi, I wouldn’t. Since I won’t speak
your language, and you can’t speak mine, English will do nicely.</p>
<p><strong>mikhi</strong>: Whatever you wish… This has all been a
terrible mistake, Gregor. I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard
insisted we try and kill you.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Edvard said the same thing about you before
he died.</p>
<p><strong>mikhi</strong>: I’m shocked, shocked to think that you’d
believe him.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>mikhi</strong>: Ahh…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: The moment of truth, is it?</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: What is he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: What am I doing here? Why, I’m here to see
my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia. See, your bosses had
hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross. But
they only just found out that what’s in the briefcase is completely
useless without me. I can’t fight them, and they can’t kill me – that
means we’re gonna have to do business together.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: But you hate each other!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: What’s a little hate between business
partners?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m on point, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: So, you’ve got it all figured, do you?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Figured enough to know there’s an odd man
out and I’m looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I think not. I have, of course, taken the
precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it
opens. Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: That fucking figures…</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Should any of you decide to rush me, I’ll
kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.</p>
<p><strong>mikhi</strong>: And more importantly –</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: I’ll destroy whatever’s in the case.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: It looks, Gentlemen, as if we’re gonna have
to sit down to table and work out an agreement.</p>
<p><strong>mikhi</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s one less I owe you…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You two stay here and watch our mutual
interest.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s work our way through the building. I’ll
take one wing, you take the other.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Watch your back, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I can’t take it anymore. Watch him, man, I’m
going out and finish what needs finishing!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Go on, them…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Let it go, Sam, walk away.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: God damn it!</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: We’ll die if we stay here!</p>
<p><strong>mikhi</strong>: You’ll die if you leave here.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You have to stop doing that!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ll work on it…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Turn around real slow, and try hard not to
breathe when you do it.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: It’s you… You’re the one did this to my
face, are you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Have a nice afterlife.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Seamus!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking
bullet in his head!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Do it, for Christ’s sake, do it so we can
find that stinking Gregor, he’s got the bloody package! For God’s sake,
you’re a soldier…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: You’re one of us…You been born and bred with
your own people, you can’t go against your nature. C’mon, girl, I’m
you’re people.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I’m no girl, Seamus…</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: And you ain’t nobody’s people.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s get him out of here…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Finish the job…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And now…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Finish it!</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Sam…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m really sick of you saving my life. Go
out and get the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: He’s got the briefcase rigged to explode
five seconds after anybody other than himself tries to open it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Deirdre, wait up –</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: You might have made a good field agent you
arrogant American prick, but you’re not smart enough to go up against
me.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Go ahead, shoot… Shoot and kill the bitch, I
don’t care. And yet you don’t shoot. Interesting. Put down your weapon
and walk away.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Don’t do it, Sam!</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: He’ll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me
and kill this fucker.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: If you don’t, I will…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Shoot that traitorous bitch and I’ll let you
live.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Alright? It’s bloody fucking freezing in
here!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I need to speak with that man.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t allow that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Call that number and ask them what you should
do.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You can see your friend, now.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The field dressing you put on saved his
life. Where di you learn to do that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Here and there, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You speak French.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What of it?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Nothing…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: “Your field dressing saved his life.”
That’s three I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent,
and you know it. You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a
heavy debt.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You better get some sleep, alright?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell me something first. The package: what
was it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know. Nobody knows, except a bunch of
people who are too dead to tell us. There’s probably a couple of guys
back at the Company who know, but I don’t think they plan to tell me
anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gone. Destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I guess that’s for the best.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake,
you could have killed the two of them with one shot. You could have had
the package, finished the job. But you didn’t, you sacrificed the job to
save her life. Why?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s what you would have done.</p>
<p><strong>a title</strong>: One month later…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Would you just smoke already…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I told you, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Just to keep me company, Sam – I hate
smoking alone. How about you? I thought all you IRA types smoked.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Only the stupid ones. Cigarettes kill more
patriots than bullets. Besides, I’m not IRA no more.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So where do you go from here?</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: I don’t know. I was thinking…Maybe the
three of us might partner up – guns for hire, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m up for that…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not me. You work too often with the same people
and you become friends – clouds your judgement.</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: Come off it, Sam – if we weren’t friends
already we wouldn’t be here now, would we?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: She’s got a point. Besides, I know of a job
that’s available.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How much does it pay?</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: This is for Seamus!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We have to go, Sam, we can’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s go!!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Doctor’s orders…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Goodbye, Sam…</p>
