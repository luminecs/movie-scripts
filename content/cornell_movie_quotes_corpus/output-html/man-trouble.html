<p><strong>producers shooting draft</strong>: Bruce Gilbert &amp; Carole
Eastman April 5, 1991</p>
<p><strong>2 int. rehearsal room/angle on lewis duart 2</strong>: the
choral conductor, summoning forth the sound of two women’s voices
singing the text.</p>
<p><strong>soprano/alto</strong>: ‘Wir eilen mit schwachen doch emsigen
Schritten, O Jesu, O Meister…’</p>
<p><strong>helen dextra</strong>: The latter on crutches, a cast on her
leg. They stand center stage, their texts resting on music stands.
Seated off to the side, are two male soloists . Behind them a chorus of
men and women, waiting, as:</p>
<p><strong>4 int. campus rehearsal room/angle on conductor 4</strong>:
He begins to sing aggressively over the duet. He suddenly drops his
hands to his side. The organist discontinues and the voices of the
soloists trail off:</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Spruance, would you like to show me where
it’s marked smearing here… … because I swear, I don’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t know I was.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Also, I’d be mildly content if I could have a
little less delirious self-appreciation and some small regard for
remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note.</p>
<p><strong>4 continued: 4</strong>: He returns his attention to the
score. While Joan grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the
chorus can be seen taking his seat amongst the others:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I wasn’t smearing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Sssh, come on now.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, I’m telling you, this is personally
motivated. Since I moved out he’s been doing this, making remarks and
being… incredibly pricklike…</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Now, if our lovely soprano would like to stop
grumbling for a moment, I’d like to take it once again.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: See what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I said fine, let’s do it again.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: From the beginning please.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He never says, ‘Honey I love you, you’re
doing a great job.’ I don’t feel he respects me as a person and I’m just
not that happy with the stature of our relationship.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Uhm hmm. I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Now I want you to look at Harry and tell
him how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I feel like he’s not plugged into my needs,
and I’m not getting enough positive feedback…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: See, look at him shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Well, let’s see what he wants to say
here. Harry, how do you feel when she brings out this material?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How do I feel? I feel she just overheats on
every little side issue, and when I go to try and communicate with the
woman, for some unknown reason she doesn’t believe a damn thing I
say.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Oh that’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: See what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: No, you know what this whole thing hinges
from? He came to rent a building from me which is now his place of
business…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So what, he’s not interested in that, that’s
not what he’s asking. See what she does? She wants to dig up and haul
out miscellaneous things that’s got nothing to do with this. I mean, I
agreed to come here, okay, but I have to tell you, Iwo Jima’s got a lot
of faulty notions in her head about me that….</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Alright, there. Right now. That’s another
thing I want to interject…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Pardon me, I was making a statement here.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Yes, let’s try and hear each other out if
we can. Go on, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I forgot the upshot of what I was
saying, but…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Okay, this syndrome where I’ve asked him to
address me by my given name and he just goes on ignoring my wishes.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Alright. Look at him and really tell him
how you feel about that.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I don’t want you to ever call me Iwo Jima
again!</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: That’s a legitimate request, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: If you can’t call me Adele, don’t call me
anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: So? Can you look at Iwo Jima, Harry, and
tell her…</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Better yet, can you take her by the hand
and say, ‘I hear what you’re saying’?</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Good. That’s good… because there’s a lot
of love here, isn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. campus/auditorium building - night 6</strong>: A
poster outside the building announces a future engagement of THE LEWIS
DUART MASTER CHORALE. Joan comes out the door and moves down the steps
to a campus walkway.</p>
<p><strong>7 ext. campus - night 7</strong>: Joan, walking quickly
across the campus.</p>
<p><strong>9 ext. campus - night 9</strong>: Harry and Adele moving
toward the parking structure:</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Next time I want to bring out some of our
sexual hot spots.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The hell you are, honey.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: The hell I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … at fifty bucks a shot, out a my pocket… I’m
going to listen to some pencil-necked butthead tell me I don’t know how
to relate to you…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Daddy, do you want this marriage to work or
not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I hear you, honey. But let’s have just a
little more trust on your end of this thing, okay? That’s all I ask. Get
in.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. apartment building - night 13</strong>: FOLLOWING
WITH Joan as she enters the foyer and moves along a first floor hallway
to her apartment. She turns her key in the lock, opens the door, then
steps OUT OF</p>
<p><strong>14 int. joan’s apartment - night 14</strong>: Joan stands
briefly in the dark, apprehending something untoward. She reaches to a
wall switch, turns on the lights and sees:</p>
<p><strong>15 int. joan’s apartment/living room - day 15</strong>: A
detective moves about, glancing at the devastation. Joan, seated on a
couch, addresses him: piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for
prints</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: You sure nothing of value has been removed
from the dwelling?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, nothing. That’s what’s so disturbing. I
mean, why would someone do something like this…?</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: Yeah, you have quite a nice little mess
here. It kinda looks like somebody doesn’t like you, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What do you mean, somebody doesn’t like
me?</p>
<p><strong>fingerprinter</strong>: Not much on the window. A few
partials and a bunch of smears.</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: Check out the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You think this is someone I know?</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: Let’s explore that. Have you had any
recent trouble with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: Anyone whose displeasure you might’ve
incurred in some way?</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: For instance, just the other day we had a
homicide concerning a dispute over a parking space.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Who could it be?</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: You’re not married, I take it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She’s in the process of a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What about him? He’s our conductor, he’s an
artist and not someone who’d ever…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You mean Lewie? He’d never do anything like
this.</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: You never know.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hello? Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hi, Joanie…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh great.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I just got in from Hawaii and thought I’d drop
by for a minute. What the heck happened in here?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Excuse me, it’s my sister…</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: Uhm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy, this is not the most opportune time. I
happen to have had a burglary in here last night…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh really? That’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: So could I just call you later?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, can’t you give me one minute? I’d like
to know if you got the manuscript I sent you. Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Helen Dextra, you’ve met her before.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, I have? Anyway, did you read it?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Read what? I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m talking about the book I’ve written about
Red and me, that I sent you a copy of, is that so hard to follow?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh no. You’ve written a book about Red
Layls.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Not just about him, Joanie, he’s only one of
many episodes in my life, you know that. Have you got a Perrier?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, I don’t. Let me just call you at home
later.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m not going to be home. I’m checking into a
hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot. Then I’m going to New
York, to meet with a top publisher… … which, incidentally, I would not
care for Mr. Redmon, fecal- face Layls to know.</p>
<p><strong>andy melvenos</strong>: You know what he said to me? We’re
going to be leaving.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Wait, I need to talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>16 int. apartment building - hallway - day 16</strong>:
Melvenos and the Fingerprinter step out into the hallway, with Joan
following:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I wanted to ask you, if there’s somebody, who
for some unknown reason, doesn’t like me, what do you suggest I do?</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: I might put some bars on the windows. My
name’s Melveny, if you want to get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Really though, I don’t see how this could be
somebody I know.</p>
<p><strong>melvenos</strong>: Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Because I actually go miles out of my way to
avoid conflictual situations.</p>
<p><strong>17 int. joan’s apartment - day 17</strong>: Helen, now
captive to Andy’s epic, is seated next to her on the couch, attempting
to listen politely to a tale without an end:</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And to top it off, my lawyer said, ‘Don’t
worry, they’re just pissing into the wind…’</p>
<p><strong>helen andy</strong>: Uhm-hmm. And I said, they’re pissing
Joan has reentered the room and approaches them.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Some help I’m going to get from him, because
he’s scared to death of Red.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy, are you telling me the truth?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes, he’s afraid, they’re all afraid, they’re
all off skiing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Speaking of lawyers… One fell on me while I
was sunbathing.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I mean, are you really going to New York?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes, I’m going to New York, where I intend to
remain in semi-private seclusion, at an undisclosed…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well maybe I could stay at your house while
you’re gone. So could you tell your housekeeper to…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Wait, I just want you to hear what this
colosal shit said about me, through his great white shark of a
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Pardon me, but I don’t care what he said. My
apartment, as you can see, is a complete shambles, I have a terrible
headache, I’ve been informed that somebody doesn’t like me, and I really
don’t want to stay here by myself!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Fine, why don’t you take my house then?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Gee whiz, why make such a big deal out of
everything?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I just got off a plane that almost fell into
the Pacific Ocean like a piece of rotten fruit… … but did I mention
it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now don’t start lazing around, June. Let’s
get with it.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: You get with it.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Do you like my hair this way, or do you like
it straight?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s very nice, Sluggo. Go hose out the
kennel.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Where the hell are my nail clippers?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I told everybody to stay out of these
drawers.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: I think I’ll go down to the Amazon, and get
involved with the trees.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get this first, will you.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: They need people, because that hole is
getting…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Remember, don’t say I’m here ’til you find
out who it is.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Yeah?… I doubt that he’s here at this present
time… Yeah, maybe later today sometime… Who are you addressing? Uh, the
executive kennel maid… uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, I’ll tell him… So long.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah? Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Ferde at something Motors. He wants two
payments by tomorrow or he’s gonna come an’ repop the van.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: You know, you said you were going to get me a
little Honda Elite to tool around in.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t give me a bad time, lard. I’ve got
enough trouble with Iwo Jima and her complaints, alright? Now the woman
doesn’t even believe you’re my niece.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Well, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s not the point I’m making.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know what’s gonna happen if I can’t pay
these damn breeders and get some adult dogs on the premises? Pretty damn
quick, some asses are going to hit the pavement, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: So? I’m sick of dog turds anyway.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Jesus, here I am, sitting in the center of a
lot of wealth, the escalation in crime couldn’t be better, and I’m not
turning a damn nickel on it…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh shit. There’s Lee.</p>
<p><strong>18a ext. street/harry’s pov through window - day
18a</strong>: Across the street, a van not unlike Harry’s can be seen.
On the sidewalk beyond it, a man stands putting coins in a parking
meter.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m in Vegas, delivering a couple a dogs to
Wayne Newton. Duke, Fuss’! You don’t know when to expect me.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Socorro!! Wait a minute! I want to talk to
you!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Excuse me, Socorro, but do you mind if I ask
what’s happening, why are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>socorro</strong>: No se, lo siento.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m asking, where-are-you-going?</p>
<p><strong>socorro</strong>: Esto me yerno, Balthazar. You speak please
Balto para mi.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes, what’s going on, are you bringing her
back later or what?</p>
<p><strong>balto</strong>: Yeah, Monday I bring her back.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Monday? But this is Thursday, I can’t stay
here alone ’til Monday.</p>
<p><strong>joan socorro</strong>: It’s my understanding Si, lunes,
lunes. that Socorro lived here, otherwise, I would’ve made other
plans.</p>
<p><strong>balto</strong>: Yeah, but she got her time off, too, man, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, this is just glorious.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: As she leans down to look for the
fallen part, a pickup truck can be seen parked down the street. The back
of the driver’s head can be seen and on the side panel of the truck are
the words “Canyon Tree Surgeons.”</p>
<p><strong>22 int. andy’s house/bedroom - night 22</strong>: TRAILER
MUSIC. Joan is asleep on the bed. Lying beside her is a fireplace poker
and a mallet meat tenderizer.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hey, Andy!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s Butch! Get your ass in gear and say
hello to your old drinking buddy!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy’s not here!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well, who are you, honey?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: She’s out of town, and there happens to be
several other people in here trying to sleep, so…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Whyn’t you come out and say hello?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Will you please go away!?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Come on, stick your head out the door an’
let’s see what you look like.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m sorry, but if you don’t leave, I’m going
to call the Foothill Patrol.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well, fuck you, honey.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Tch, where does she find these people.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I was just trying to be nice. Go ahead an’
call ’em, bitch, I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’ll just come back and kick your ass in for
you.</p>
<p><strong>22a int./ext. andy’s house/living room - night 22a</strong>:
Joan moves along the windows with her weapons in hand, watching as Butch
wavers erratically up to the driveway where the previously seen pickup
can be seen. She waits until he gets in and drives off, then she moves
back into the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Duke, platz! Always the name first, and then
the command.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now, in regard to any aggressor seeking to
give you a bad time, I want to show you what you can expect from a dog
of this caliber.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here we have the dog’s arsenal, so to speak.
The animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body
until the bone is more or less crushed. If the attacker is bearing a
weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a club, a knife or what-have-you, the
dog will, excuse me for saying… … automatically go for the
testicles.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh god, what if I don’t want him to do
that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You want him to do that.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, I just want him to scare someone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Believe me, this will scare them, as well as
incapacitate their mind and any ability to maneuver against you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know, I have an extremely sensitive
reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let me ask you something. I like to get a
general picture of the individual situation I’m working with.</p>
<p><strong>23 continued: 23</strong>: He pauses to light a cigarette,
making a quick, reflexive appraisal of her contours as he does:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you married, single, living alone or with
some other party?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m in the process of a divorce and I moved up
here because my apartment was burglarized and… But I’m not entirely
alone, there’s a housekeeper here, and several friends.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as
burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth
victim of the Westside Slasher…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, please, don’t tell me about that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Believe me, I know what you’re up against,
being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are…
But we’re going to remedy that situation right now, and get you to
feeling as safe as a little baby, alright? What’ve we got there so
far?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Ober, platz, geh am platz, bringen, komm,
sitz, fuss’, fahrt and blieb.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, that’s enough for a start on the basic
control commands…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now let’s do a little work with the
assailant.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Alright now, Joan, give him the command,
‘Duke, wachen sie.’</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Duke, wachen sie.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good. The dog is now on alert.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is really a nice piece of real estate
you’ve got here.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It’s not mine, it’s my sister’s.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, it’s your sister’s. And where’s she?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Am I doing this right? Shouldn’t I be prepared
for something?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Never look at your dog.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Never look at your dog? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>joan harry</strong>: Oh my God! Duke, fasse!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dammit, June, don’t exhibit fear until I tell
you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get him under control now, Joan.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I am… Good boy, be nice.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Give him the off command!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I forgot it! You tell him! Duke, stop!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Duke, aus!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: My golly, that was incredible. I love this
dog. Did you see that? I can’t believe how strong he is. I felt like a
rag doll…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ordinarily I wouldn’t do this, even on a
temporary rental basis, because he’s the absolute top security and
attack dog in the country.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is this your sister?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes, that’s her, with her third husband, Eric
Ellerman.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uhm hmm. Wait a minute, who’s this guy, isn’t
this Red Layls?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No kidding. Your sister’s involved with Red
Layls? This guy’s gotta be one of the five or ten richest men in the
country, with business connections all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>25 continued: 25</strong>: Feeling slighted, she watches him
move to a picture of Andy descending the steps of a plane with Layls
watching her on the tarmac.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And she’s your sister. That’s amazing. I
mean, this is an individual I’d really like to meet sometime.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Boy, look at that figure. I have to say, your
sister is really an attractive looking woman.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, that’s quite a compliment. I’ll have to
pass it on.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll skip back up in a day or two, okay, just
to see how you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And Joan, I want you to know, it’s been a
great pleasure doing business with you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh well… … thank you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Feel free to call on me for anything. Anytime
of the night or day, 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And would you also thank your…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I sincerely mean that.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: You big flirt.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, dumpty, don’t start that. This is
quality clientele. It calls for a certain kind of approach. Just soak
some of this in, will you?</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Soak this.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Start to pattern yourself. Breed up. Observe
the woman, for Christ sakes.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Oh screw her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You don’t screw this type of individual.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: You would.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is the kind of atmosphere we want to
gravitate toward. Did she even ask me the cost? Dammit, I really respect
that.</p>
<p><strong>on june</strong>: grumbling as she moves to the passenger
door:</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Well I don’t, he isn’t even your dog.</p>
<p><strong>28 int. andy’s house/bedroom - night 28</strong>: Joan, her
mood light-hearted, enters, with Duke following. She crosses to the
closet, selects a change of clothes and moves to lay them out on the
bed. Noting the message light blinking on her answering machine, she
steps over to the night-stand, presses the playback and to a series of
TONES preceding the recorded messages,</p>
<p><strong>29 int. andy’s house/bathroom - night 29</strong>: The
indistinct sounds of a TAPED MESSAGE OVER: Joan turns the tap on in the
wash basin and begins splashing water on her face. Then as she reaches
to a towel and turns the tap off, the WORDS of a popular ROCK SONG can
be heard. Exhibiting some curiosity, she exits the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. street/int. joan’s car - night 31</strong>: Once
again Joan is stopped at a signal. Aware of someone watching her, she
turns to look through the window. A MAN in an adjacent car is staring at
her, and momentarily addresses her with a peculiar request:</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: How about a little smile.</p>
<p>****: Conducting the soprano section of the “Et Resurrexit,”
accompanied by the pianist.</p>
<p><strong>on rest of chorale</strong>: The previously seen Eddy Revere
among them.</p>
<p><strong>on joan and other soloists</strong>: Seated on a lower level
of the tiered chairs arranged in a semi-circle around Lewie.</p>
<p><strong>closer on joan</strong>: Her eyes fixed on Lewie intensely
perusing him for any signs of malevolence.</p>
<p><strong>her pov of lewie</strong>: As he addresses the sopranos over
their voices.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: This is supposed to sound virginal, ladies,
so let’s try to fake it.</p>
<p><strong>on soprano chorus</strong>: singing and their various
reactions to the above remark.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: Don’t do what?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You’re not supposed to look him straight in
the eye.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: You have a dog you can’t look in the eye,
Joan?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: He’s not just a dog. He’s a Schutzhund trained
attack dog.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I was told to avoid a direct gaze and always
look at the base of the right or the left ear.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: You don’t have to go to all this trouble, I’ve
offered to stay up at your sister’s with you?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I can’t tell you how mad I am at Lewie, that I
have to leave him out here, tied to a tree…</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: God, you’re stubborn, Joan.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m not stubborn, I’m so accommodating, it’s
sickening.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: But you won’t tell me what’s really bothering
you. Why don’t you confide in me anymore?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: No you don’t. Come on, talk to me. Let’s go
have a drink after rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Eddy, you better come, he’s rehearsing the
tenors!</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: I’m coming…! How about tomorrow night
then?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I don’t know. Let’s say maybe.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: Well don’t go out of your way, Joan.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Eddy? Tomorrow’s fine. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>34 omitted 34</strong>: &amp; &amp; 35 35</p>
<p><strong>36 int. andy’s house/living room - late day 36</strong>:
Harry, Joan and Duke following, moves along the glass facade,
inspecting, then assessing the security status of the house:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I’d have to say this place is a snap to
break into.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I knew it. I shouldn’t have moved here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t worry. The dog’ll take care of anyone
trying to get inside.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I don’t know what to do. Maybe I should move
into a motel.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, you don’t have to do that. This is just
some ding-dong that’s trying to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well he’s succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But you don’t want to give off that
impression, by acting too timid or afraid, because that’s what invites
an aggressive attitude from certain types of men.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I didn’t invite this.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: For instance, don’t go mincing along, taking
mousey little steps, and waving your hanky, because you’re drawing a
target on yourself if you do…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Do I do that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, let’s see. Just walk back and forth the
way you normally do.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well I don’t normally walk back and forth,
but… okay.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t do it with you watching
me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, but keep in mind that you want to
exhibit a very confident attitude. Look like you know what you’re doing
and where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Uhm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just remember to stop short of appearing a
little dykey, because that’s not attractive.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: But I thought that’s your point, no to
attract…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, no, you always want to remain a little
bit attractive. Otherwise that can set somone off too.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: This is just impossible.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You just can’t win.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure you can, it’s just a matter of
degree.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well darn it, I give up…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh-oh. Now what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m sorry but this is really getting to
me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell you what. Let me take you out of here,
buy you a drink, and see if we can’t get your mind off these kind of
things.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: That’s very sweet of you, Harry. I’d like to
do that.</p>
<p><strong>37 int. yamashiro inn/pavilion - late day 37</strong>: ,
featuring a morbid, nearly John and Harry seated at a table. She is well
past the loosening effects of a second glass of wine, is not unaware
that Harry is looking at her:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: How long have you been divorced?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, I’d say seven or eight years, around
there.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And so you like, well, assuming you live a
single existence, I mean most men don’t seem to enjoy that, I’ve
read.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I have to tell you the truth… I’ve been
observing your hands, and I have to use the word exquisite.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Really? Well…</p>
<p><strong>37 continued: 37</strong>: Embarrassed by the compliment, she
reaches to her glass and nearly knocks it over, spilling a bit of wine
onto the tablecloth and is relieved to find him gazing off and unaware
of her gaffe.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re probably quite a singer too. I’d like
to come down and catch you sometime.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Very much. Even to the degree that when it’s
playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just mean it starts to get to me too much.
I can’t swallow my saliva.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have laughed.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things
like that. All those type of things really get to me.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Uhm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>37a continued: 37a</strong>: She is flushed from the wine and
exhilarated by her response to Harry:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You’re full of surprises, Harry, you know
that? That you’ve actually read Dante’s Divine Comedy I mean…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, it was a while back there that I did,
yeah…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know that part? ‘Yet as a wheel moves
smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The
love that moves the sun and other stars.’</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: For some reason, the sublimity of that always
touches me.</p>
<p><strong>37b ext. yamashiro inn/front entrance - night 37b</strong>:
Joan and Harry come down the steps of the Inn. The sun has gone down and
the lights of the city have come on. Under the following they cross the
driveway to a low fence railing off an Oriental garden.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know, it’s very sad. I look at my sister
and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life
is in, and I think it’s very sad and very bleak that men and women can’t
manage to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It depends on the man and woman you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What a tragedy that sex is often such a
barrier to friendship between men and women.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There I disagree with you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know Dante and Beatrice never slept
together.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is that right? Oh yeah, I forgot that
part.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, anyway… I shouldn’t have had so much
wine… because I prefer to go a little slow here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We can go as slow as you want… why not?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: So… You think men and women can be
friends?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Alright now, don’t play too rough.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, no, Duke, don’t do that, that’s not nice.
Now sitz. And behave yourself.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ‘Lewie. Mad at me.’</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Doesn’t want a divorce. Maybe he’s trying to
scare me, or punish me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s definitely not Lewie.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You’re not exactly a disinterested party.
You’re always promoting his cause…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Number one, I’ve known the man for fifteen
years, number two, he… loves you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ’Eddy Revere, a little moody, but a good
friend and very reliable.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: An opinion I don’t share, but… What do you
think about Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He has a terrible temper. We know that.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ‘Vincent Gallardo. Doubtful. We’ve never had
an unpleasant word.’ Aren’t you lucky. ‘Kenneth Dowler…’</p>
<p><strong>on kenneth dowler</strong>: He stands with a styrofoam cup in
his hand, coming on to one of the members of the female chorus:</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ‘Always trying to connect with me, proposing
private rehearsals at his apartment.’ You know what he asked me
yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What my cup size was. Steve Jewel! Who’s
Steve Jewel?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: My piano tuner.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is he weird or something?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well everyone appears weird to me right now.
So I put every possible name down, except for one, who happens to be
post- burglary.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think it’s him, the tree surgeon. He sounds
very suspicious…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Just don’t tell Lewie about the phone message
or the thing I got in the mail, because he’ll just use it to…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I already did.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Helen.</p>
<p><strong>41 int. campus rehearsal room - night 41</strong>: Joan and
Lewie stand in the doorway of the rehearsal room. chairs, and some,
including Eddy Revere and Helen, show occasional interest in the intense
exchange taking place</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: I’m extremely concerned about this situation.
I don’t want you living alone up there.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Now come on, wouldn’t you feel much safer if
you moved back into our house?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, I wouldn’t feel comfortable about doing
that.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Come here…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Darn it, Lewie.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: What? Are you afraid of your responses to
me?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Tch…</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Why are you resisting?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: These are very upsetting, really shitty
circumstances I’m dealing with and I…</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Do you know how hard all this has been on me?
Do you think it’s that easy for me to admit I want you back?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Couldn’t you spare yourself then?</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Are you seeing anybody? Just tell me
that.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Come on, you’re not the abstinent type.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Please, don’t judge me by your scrotal
excesses, Lewie.</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: I know you’re seeing somebody.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Are you spying on me?</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: Come on. Be open about it. Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>41 continued: 41</strong>: Her gaze meets Helen’s, who,
misconstruing the situation, makes an “OK” sign, delivering her semiotic
sanction to the happy reunion in the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Alright, I am seeing someone, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lewie</strong>: I don’t believe you. Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. andy’s house/patio - night 43</strong>: Socorro sets
the tray down and departs for the kitchen with Duke again falling in
behind her. Joan begins to pour their coffee, glancing inside the house
to see… Socorro turning lights out while the indefatigable Duke tries to
mount her. Uttering some impatient complaint, she swipes at him with a
napkin and the two move OUT OF VIEW THROUGH the kitchen door.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know, I hate to mention this but we’re
having a slight problem with Duke.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well… He keeps getting up and trying to ride
on one’s extremities.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh don’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Especially Socorro, who can’t speak English,
let alone German, and sometimes she has to go pulling him from room to
room like a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, that’s just normal in most of your adult
males. Some percentage of the time they’re gonna attempt to make these
vulgar motions on your person.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You just have to be very firm and stay on top
of him.</p>
<p><strong>43a int. andy’s house/living room - night 43a</strong>: Joan
and Harry are seated on the couch having coffee as they listen to a
CHOPIN NOCTURNE. He is doing his best to emulate her posture of
thoughtful intensity as she listens, but as he steals a look at her his
adult male impulses causes him to shift about slightly. She looks over
at him:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It’s not affecting you too much, is it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, it’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It’s Chopin, a nocturne.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know what’s affecting me?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Night-piece, it means.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I think I should say something.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: That’s the problem though, I want to be honest
with you…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There’s no problem.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Because I recently realized something about
myself. That I’ve slept with a number of men in my life just because I
didn’t want them not to like me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: being one of</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: But the thing is, I didn’t like most of them
that much, so why did I care whether they liked me or not?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know, I’m not one of these guys who’s
going to look upon you as an object.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, I know, that’s not what I’m saying…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Because I look upon a woman as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What I’m saying is I don’t know if right now I
might not go to bed with you because I don’t want to be alone, so I
thought maybe we… could try to explore other modes, or…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Other modes?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I mean, there are other ways of being
intimate, that people don’t even realize.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uhm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Which doesn’t mean I’m not attracted to
you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But you don’t want me to bring you
around.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Other modes is fine. You don’t have to be shy
with me. I’ve been asked to do do every kind of thing in the book.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: God, it’s so hard to pioneer in this area…
when you keep doing that…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Please leave a message after the tone… Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>44 continued: 44</strong>: The BEEP is followed by Andy’s
voice, in some waning stage of sedation, coming from the phone
speaker:</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Joan? It’s Andy… Are you there? I want to
inform you that these people are drugging me…</p>
<p><strong>44a int. darkened hospital room 44a</strong>: Andy, speaking
covertly into a telephone. She wears a hospital smock and is seated on
the edge of bed occupied by a woman in a drug-induced state of
oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: There’s no phone in my room, or cable TV. I’ve
had to sneak into this cell next to me, with some poor lithium zombie
lying here like a comatose cabbage…</p>
<p><strong>44b int. andy’s house/bedroom - back to harry and joan
44b</strong>: her expression shows some concern:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Maybe I better take this.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And this is the lengths this assassin is
willing to go to suppress me, because he does not want me to have my
book.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Harry, excuse me, it’s my sister.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy… It’s Joan.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh you’re there. Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Where are you? Are you in New York?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, that’s what I’m telling you. I went into
the hospital first, for one day, just to have a simple bone spur…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I know, you told me that, but where are you
now?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: … and the next thing I know I’m transported
some place the hell else, against my knowledge, while I was completely
medicated…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy, wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you understand the implications of this, I
have no underpants on, and absolutely no recourse to my rights!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh God, this is because of Red, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes, it’s because of Red, isn’t that
obvious!?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And if he and that fuckface lawyer in his paid
employ, think they can … Wait. I think I hear someone.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Find out where she is.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Hello? Andy? You have to tell me where you
are.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I told you, I don’t know where I am, these
bastards are very clever.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m in some private cracker box in the
boonies, with godammed wires on the windows…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ask her the name of the first hospital.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy, tell me the name of the hospital you
checked yourself into.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mount Haven, it’s in the South Bay, and don’t
ask me these inane questions, just do something…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell her we’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: We’ll find it, okay, so don’t worry…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I hear someone coming, I have to get off.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: … because I’m sure there’s some simple
explanation…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What should I do? Should I call the
police?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s just take a run out there.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You mean right now?</p>
<p><strong>44f ext. freeway - series of shots - night 44f</strong>: as
Joan’s car creeps along on a Saturday night Freeway, bottling up a line
of cars behind.</p>
<p><strong>45 ext. freeway/int. joan’s car - night 45</strong>: Harry is
none too happily confined to the passenger seat as Joan, white knuckling
on the wheel, obsesses on Andy:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I told her she shouldn’t do this, I mean, to
be so maniacally obsessed with this soul of mud that she’d even want to
write a book about him, is beyond me…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well the guy must be doing something right to
have amassed that amount of wealth.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: But she does this, you know, she just
periodically drops the entire weight of her life on me like a ton of
bricks.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Joan, can I make a suggestion?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes, please, anything.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You better try an keep up a little with the
flow or we’re gonna get cited.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. mount haven hospital/reception area - night
46</strong>: Harry stands scowling for effect, his arm around Joan. A
MALE ADMISSION’S CLERK sits at a computer behind a counter, keying up a
file, then reading if off the screen:</p>
<p><strong>a.c.</strong>: Ellerman, Antonia. She was admitted on the
third of the month and was signed out at 3:45 P.M. on the fourth, by her
personal physician…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: How do you know he was her physician?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hell, I could come in here and say I was a
doctor an’ sign somebody out.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And even if he was a doctor, it doesn’t mean
he was my sister’s doctor.</p>
<p><strong>a.c.</strong>: According to this he was her doctor.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Then who was the doctor who operated on her
foot?</p>
<p><strong>a.c.</strong>: There’s nothing on here about her foot. It
says ‘observation for clinical depression.’</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: That’s a lie. She was in here for an
operation, then she was drugged and taken out of here against her
will.</p>
<p><strong>a.c.</strong>: That couldn’t possibly happen, we have very
strict regulations about…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, let’s stop wasting time here, where is
this guy, what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>a.c.</strong>: His name is Dr. Monroe Park. It doesn’t say
where he is.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I can’t believe this, you mean there’s no
phone number or address?</p>
<p><strong>a.c.</strong>: I’m sorry, but I didn’t type this file…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What kind of business are you running here,
buddy?</p>
<p><strong>a.c.</strong>: All I can do is give you the data I have on
here. If you want to call the Physician’s Registry… There’s some public
phones over there. He’s probably listed with them.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: He approaches, answering her expectant look
with a shake of the head and the disheartening news:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nothing. No Dr. Monroe Park.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. mount haven hospital - night 48</strong>: Harry and
Joan, moving toward the hospital parking lot:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: How am I supposed to find this man? Maybe he
used a false name, or maybe he isn’t even a doctor…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ve got a couple of ideas here. First, we
want to try an’ connect with Red Layls.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, I don’t want anything to do with Red, I’m
terrified of him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There’s nothing to be afraid of, believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I mean, you hear all kinds of things, about
government kickbacks, and Panamanian drug couriers and…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know these type of guys. You take away
their money and their power, and what are they.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, really, I have to do something. I have to
go to the police…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just hold off a bit on that, honey, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You called me honey.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well that’s what you are.</p>
<p><strong>48 continued: 48</strong>: He puts an arm around her,
speaking in reassuring tones:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I want to get a hold of this top private
investigator, who’s a close, personal friend of mine, okay, and get him
to find out who this doctor is.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Harry, this isn’t your problem and I don’t
want to draw you into it…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t worry, we’re going to find your sister.
Everything’s going to turn out fine.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. meryl’s coffee shop - on newspaper headline - day
49</strong>: reading “Sixth Victim of Westside Slasher.” The ANGLE
SHIFTS to reveal Harry seated at a table next to a plate glass window,
reading the above paper. The view is inclusive of The House of Bliss
across the street. He lowers the paper as a waitress appears with a
Silex of coffee. She sits down opposite him, refilling his cup and
addressing him in a familiar manner:</p>
<p><strong>vita</strong>: Okay, go ahead, I’ve gotta hear this. Who is
it this time?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, it’s not what you think. This is a very
unique individual I’m talking about. Plus there’s a mind there, as well
as a body and a face.</p>
<p><strong>vita</strong>: Didn’t I hear this before, about the hostess
at Denny’s, that was a college graduate and had a mole like Elizabeth
Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m telling you, this is something completely
different. You gotta meet her. She sings opera and has the hands of a
hula dancer…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anyway, you remember that private detective
that use to come in here all the time? On the portly side, bald, had
kind of crossed eyes…</p>
<p><strong>vita</strong>: Oh. Fred, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, that’s him. How do you think I could
get a hold of him?</p>
<p><strong>vita</strong>: Oh gee, I think he’s moved out of the area and
went into gourmet snacks.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. meryl’s coffee shop/ext. street - day 50</strong>:
Harry’s attention is drawn to June, tapping on the window.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. house of bliss/parking lot - day 51</strong>: Harry
stands back, uneasily regarding the smoked windows and the sun flaring
off the glossy surfaces of the car.</p>
<p><strong>51 continued: 51</strong>: Presently, the passenger door
opens and L.N. MONCRIEF, a barely discernible presence in a suit
blending in with the dark interior of the car, addresses him by
name:</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Mr. Bliss, I’d like to have word with you,
if I may.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re talking to the wrong godammed party,
you know that?</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I think it’s in your best interest to hear
me out.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, you hear me out, friend…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, I happen to have a very high regard for
this party. And maybe I even have some feelings of a personal nature
here.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Well I don’t want to appear to be taking
unfair advantage of you…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Goddamned right.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: But in developing certain information on
you, it’s come to our attention that your name isn’t Harry Bliss. That
in fact, your name is Eugene Earl Axline…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: And that both the I.R.S., and an
impressive number of creditors in several Eastern cities… … seem to be
somewhat interested in your whereabouts.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know, that’s not necessarily entirely
accurate, I mean, I don’t know where you come up with these so-called
facts, but… I can’t go sneaking around, stealing this lady’s
property.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I’d like to pose that the name and
reputation of this very decent man, is not the property of
Mrs. Ellerman, or her sister.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: And it’s my hope that we can avoid any
unpleasant eventualities, either for you, or for someone you have such
admirable feelings toward…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What do you mean, ‘unpleasant’?</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I mean that Mr. Layls is prepared to do
whatever it takes to confiscate this document. And if you’d like to be
of some assistance to us, by finding it and turning it over to me, he’d
like to offer you this very generous gift.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Jesus Christ, I hardly know the woman. I’m
just renting a dog to her, that’s all. What kind of a person do you take
me for?</p>
<p><strong>closeup of typhon corporation check</strong>: signed by L.N.
Moncrief and made out to the sum of $15,000.</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. andy’s house/driveway - day 54</strong>: Joan gets
out of the Mercedes and opens the gates. As she moves back to the
driver’s door, she glances at Butch, then gets quickly into the car. She
drives in through the gates and once again gets out to close them behind
her.</p>
<p><strong>on butch</strong>: He watches sullenly as her car disappears
through the gates, then lifts a can of beer to his mouth and drinks.</p>
<p><strong>angle - upstairs</strong>: On an upstairs landing, she
searches through some drawers and cupboards. Then spotting Socorro on
the level below:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, Socorro…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Could you come in here, por favor?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I-am-looking-for-my-sister’s-book.</p>
<p><strong>socorro</strong>: No. No es mi.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: La manuscripto … de mi hermana, Andy, si? I
go… toda la casa… Everywhere… Looking y looking… And no es anywhere.
Sabe usted?</p>
<p><strong>socorro</strong>: No se, no entiendo… Lo siento…</p>
<p><strong>55a int. andy’s house/bedroom - continuous action - day
55a</strong>: Joan rifles through the drawers of a small escritoire
against the back wall of the bedroom. Then she moves toward the dressing
area giving off to the bathroom, and stops as she sees the top rung of a
ladder just visible above the bottom ledge of a window adjacent to the
shower. A small section of glass has been removed, just large enough to
permit the entry of hand to the window lock.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I told this detective I wanted to press
charges against Red Layls, for abducting Andy, for burglarizing my
apartment, for breaking into her house…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh come on, you’re way off.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And that he’s been trying to scare and
intimidate me in case I might have read something in her manuscript that
he doesn’t want anybody to know. And you know what he said? That I
haven’t given him probable cause to even go and question Red Layls, or
his lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, he’s right, I could’ve told you that.
This is a man who goes fishing with the President, honey. He’s a little
high up to go around burglarizing people and sending them nasty notes.
So why don’t you just ease back on this thing for awhile… Life’s too
godammed short.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I can’t do that, Harry. This is my sister. I
can at least make out a missing persons report on her, and then I want
to talk to the private detective friend of yours.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m trying to chase the guy down, okay? But
don’t go and make yourself sick…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I mean, Jesus, why don’t you just get this
damn thing and hand it over to me and I’ll give it to these guys.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You mean to Red?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, to Red, or whoever…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well if I ever find, it, that’s the last thing
I’d do with it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dammit, you’re making my work more difficult
for me, you know that!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What is this, have I come at the wrong time or
something?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I tell you what the hell to do and you don’t
listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, someone abates your maidenhood and
suddenly feels they can start ordering you around.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not ordering you around. I’m just giving
you my opinion. And maybe I get tired of hearing about this stuff all
the time, this book business, this manu-whatever, and Red Layls, and
your sister.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh. Well… I’m sorry if I’ve overtaxed you with
my problems, Harry, but I never asked you to consider them a part of
your work. So why don’t we speak when you’re in a better frame of
mind.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ah honey, now…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Aw honey yourself.</p>
<p><strong>on harry</strong>: again seated at his desk. He stares out
the window, in the throes of a moral conflict. Then making some sudden
resolve he opens a drawer, takes out an envelope and a paperback book
and lays them on the desk.</p>
<p><strong>closeup on paperback</strong>: The price sticker is still
attached above the title: Dante’s Divine Comedy - Simplified Edition. He
opens the book, removes the Typhon voucher from between its pages and
begins addressing the envelope with the information on the check. Then
he puts the voucher into the envelope and seals it.</p>
<p><strong>57 ext. street - evening 57</strong>: Harry, envelope in
hand, moves with determination down the block from his building. He
approaches a mailbox, pulls the handle on the letter drop and inserts
his hand inside the chute. He holds it there a moment, seized by
indecision, and then brings his hand back out, still holding the
envelope. Turning around, he angrily stuffs it into his back pocket and
heads back to the House of Bliss.</p>
<p><strong>58a int. andy’s house/kitchen - night 58a</strong>: Joan,
carrying two glasses of beer, crosses to exit the kitchen, the
ubiquitous Duke trailing after her. She pauses to address Socorro, at
the service island, vigorously hacking at the pink cadaver of chicken
and tossing the dismembered pieces into a stewing pot:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, Socorro, please-keep-the-dog … el perro,
in… in piso inferior, por favor… exercise room… Tiene allergy…</p>
<p><strong>socorro</strong>: Ah, si. Duke, venga aqui.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: … And now I’d like you to meet the director
and the star of the smash hit movie, Blood And Kisses. So let’s give
them a nice warm welcome…</p>
<p><strong>59a int. andy’s house/den 59a</strong>: APPLAUSE OVER. On a
large TV screen, where a fervently solicitous HOST addresses the
DIRECTOR. Seated beside him is the Actress previously seen on the
billboard and</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Before we begin, why don’t we show the
audience a clip from the movie. Do you want to set it up for us?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Well, it’s a bit… this scene involves…
just go ahead and run it.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: I must say, this is a dazzling piece of work
and you two are a dynamite wedding of talents…</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: But I hear you’re a little sensitive about the
criticism you’ve had about the amount of sexual violence and nudity you
have in the picture…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: ‘Any scars, marks or tattoos.’</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Well it’s absurd. In the first place, I
didn’t invent this genre. And it happens to be a tradition in this kind
of film that women make more interesting and exciting victims than men
do…</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Well, I understand…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And secondly the violence directed at
Mimi’s character is an essential component of the story, and is not in
any sense of the word, gratuitous.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: But, Mimi, now what about you. That scene
where you run nude through Times Square with those multiple knife wounds
all over your body. That must’ve been horrendous for you.</p>
<p><strong>joan actress</strong>: Assholes. Yes it was, very
horrendous…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Come on, let me drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>helen actress</strong>: Wait. But what helped me
enormously</p>
<p><strong>60 omitted 60</strong>: thru thru</p>
<p><strong>64 int. house of bliss - rear apartment - night 64</strong>:
June, lying on a studio couch with a remote control in her hand, looking
at the Actress:</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: … and that scene came directly after the
gang rape in the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s her problem.</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: Also, I love Dick’s taste so I knew he was
handling it very artistically…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now what’s she complaining about?</p>
<p><strong>harry host</strong>: Give me that. Well, you’re just Iwo’s
got some shit she’s Don’t go away, we’ll be looking at… right back.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I come over here to look at the ball game
and you give me these clowns.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I mean, what’s wrong with these women.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: You want a know something?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They don’t want to hear the truth, that’s
what disturbs me.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: There’s some people that don’t treat me like
you do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You tell them the truth and they come at you
with a cleaver.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: I know one guy that says very complimentary
things to me, like that I have nice features and a sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What guy?</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Some guy I met, that likes me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re going to leave me, lard, just after
I’ve broken you in, and taught you the fine art of dog training?</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Maybe. As if you cared.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Women. What’s the score?</p>
<p><strong>angle inside joan’s car</strong>: Joan turns the IGNITION ON
and as she starts to buckle herself in, her eye catches the movement of
something at the back of the garage.</p>
<p><strong>x64 continued: x64</strong>: From behind a sheet of plywood
resting against the back wall of the garage, and just visible in the
darkness, a man’s hand can be seen reaching to the handle of an ax in
amongst other gardening tools in an iron rack. Helen opens the passenger
door and Joan whispers to her:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Helen, quick, get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Helen! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I can’t! I can’t move!!</p>
<p><strong>x64c ext. andy’s house/garage - night x64c</strong>: The
hooded man has Joan up against the garage wall. One of his hands is on
her throat and the other is held over her mouth. In the struggle, she
manages to sink her teeth into his hand. He pulls it free and hits her
across the face. She reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and
pole-axes him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and
enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately grabs an iron rake
from the garden rack and turns fiercely toward him. Now standing,
vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently having had enough, he begins
to back away from her. When he reaches a safe distance, he turns and
moves quickly off, disappearing into the dark.</p>
<p><strong>x64d int. andy’s house/living room - some time later
x64d</strong>: Joan, her garments soiled and disheveled from the pre-
vious scene, comes from the vicinity of the front door, closely followed
by Duke and Harry:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why didn’t you have the damn dog with you,
that’s what he’s for!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I told you, he was in the house.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What the hell good is that! You have to have
him with you at all times!</p>
<p><strong>x64d continued: x64d</strong>: As they move into the living
room, Helen, wearing Joan’s chenille robe, her hair wildly askew, can be
seen in the kitchen area, holding a bottle of liquor in one hand and
searching through a cupboard for a glass.</p>
<p><strong>joan harry</strong>: I can’t have him with me Didn’t I tell
you, right all the time, he’s killing from the start, it’s my mucous
membranes… very dangerous to fool</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No you didn’t, I said he was dangerous, and
you said he wasn’t…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, but that’s before he tried to part your
hair with an axe!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I don’t know if it was him. Maybe it was this
tree surgeon…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait a minute. How tall was he? About six
one? Kind of ugly?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He was about your height.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, he wasn’t, he was much taller.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well let’s not quibble, for god sakes. The
man is a complete maniac… And excuse me for saying, but this isn’t a job
for an amateur…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: But wait, he couldn’t be the same man who
burglarized my apartment, because that’s before I came up here…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Forget about him. I know what I’m talking
about…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Joan, if you don’t call the police, I’m not
staying here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Guy like Red Layls have hit men working for
them, that drive them around and do their dirty work for them.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Gee whiz, first it isn’t Red, now it is Red. I
can’t keep up with these sudden reversals.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Alright… I’m calling a cab.</p>
<p><strong>65 omitted 65</strong>: thru thru 67 67</p>
<p><strong>68 int. andy’s house/bedroom and bathroom - night
68</strong>: Harry sits on chaise trying not to catch glimpses of Joan,
who is changing her clothes in the closet. The mood is more subdued.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know what I think? It’s more than one
person.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s not more than one person. I’m telling
you who the hell it is!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: But I don’t think Red would have someone sing
into my answering machine…</p>
<p><strong>68a angle on closet 68a</strong>: Joan sticks her head out
door.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It doesn’t seem like something he’d do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dammit, Joan!!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: God, what is this?! I can’t say anything to
you anymore, you’re so darn touchy!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can mention anything you want, honey. I’m
just trying to keep you from turning up face down, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I mean, I can’t leave you up here alone
now…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It’s Andy’s –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s very becoming on you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: – Maybe I don’t quite fill it out.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes you do.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>68a continued: 68a</strong>: He gets up and comes over to the
bed and reaches a hand down to touch the side of her face. She looks up
at him:</p>
<p><strong>69 ext. andy’s house/driveway - next day 69</strong>: Harry
stands watching Joan. She pulls the Mercedes half- way out of the garage
and stops the car to call out to him:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What are you going to do now? Are you going to
leave?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, I’m going to skip down the hill, take
care of a few things, pick up some clothes…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Could you be back for dinner, around 7:00?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>69 continued: 69</strong>: thing out of the hood for you.” J:
“Later, I don’t have She blows him a kiss. Then moves down the driveway
toward the gates. He stands watching until her car disappears. Then he
moves to front door of the house and finds it locked.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>socorro</strong>: Ella no esta aqui.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just want to look for my… … watch, I think
I left it… … in there.</p>
<p><strong>socorro</strong>: Ah si, es okay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks, Soco.</p>
<p><strong>close on harry</strong>: He opens the drawer, glances inside
and starts to close it when he sees:</p>
<p><strong>pov of drawer</strong>: A gift envelope with his name on it
rests on a small wrapped box. He picks it up, opens the envelope and
takes out a plain white card with a handwritten message on it:</p>
<p><strong>close on card</strong>: “Thank you for everything you’ve done
for me, Harry, and mostly, for being in my life. I love you, Joan.”</p>
<p><strong>72a ext. adele’s front lawn - late day 72a</strong>: Adele
stands playing a garden hose over the lawn. Two pop-eyed little DOGS YAP
and mill about her legs. In the b.g., Harry’s van can be seen in the
driveway, and presently he appears from the side of the house, carrying
a suitcase and a few items of clothes. As he moves to the van and opens
the door, her attention is drawn to him:</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Harry! What the hell do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>72a continued: 72a</strong>: He sets the suitcase down, lays
the clothes over it and crosses the lawn to her:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just got a phone call, honey, from a
prominent entertainer up in Vegas, a very well-known singer…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Who is it, Paul Anka?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He’s a rock star, you probably wouldn’t know
the name. Anyway, I gotta run a couple a dogs up to him…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You know, it’s T-minus zero and counting,
Harry, on this whole shitty deal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now Iwo, don’t blow this way out of
proportion. You think I want to do this. I need the extra cash right
now, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: If you leave, I’m getting Top Lock to come
over and change the front and back doors!</p>
<p><strong>harry adele</strong>: Look, I’m only talking time here. Ming!
Tippy! Shut</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I mean it! You get in that van, and I’m
taking my building back and putting in a Fingernail Salon!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on now, honey, don’t say things like
that…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s not make a big issue out of it…
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>73 int. andy’s house/living room - night 73</strong>: They
are finishing dessert and coffee by candlelight. Joan’s hands encircle
Harry’s wrist with a new watch.</p>

deeply morose and makes a half-hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries
to secure the clasp. the table next to the watch he used to deceive his
way</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s really very nice looking, honey.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Do you like it?</p>

needed, so…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Nothing’s wrong. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You’re probably wondering why I’m smiling.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I was just thinking that I find this moody
side of you very attractive.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: In fact, if you want to know, and I can see
you’re dying to… I completely adore you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, same here, honey.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Why are you all wet?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know, there is something I feel I gotta
say here, Joan, that’s been preying on my mind. Something I maybe
should’ve handled a bit differently with you from the start, about this
particular situation I’m in…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What situation?</p>

Joan and Harry, looking toward the television set. Socorro stands next
to the screen, pointing at herself, a small figure near the front door
of Andy’s house. In the f.g. a television REPORTER addresses the

<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … Regarding an earlier press release
announcing Mrs. Ellerman’s intention to publish her book, which
purportedly contains several explosive details concerning Redmon Layls’
controversial business dealings.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Layls’ lawyer, Laurence Moncrief, had
this to say when asked if he was concerned about what might be revealed
in the Ellerman book:</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I have no knowledge whatsoever of
Mrs. Ellerman’s so-called book, or her alleged disappearance, which
appears to have all the ear marks of a publicity stunt.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Can you believe this?!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Recent reports of Layls’ failing health
were denied by his personal physician, Dr. Park. When questioned in a
phone interview, he responded that the elusive billionaire…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … was recovering from quote, ‘nothing more
than the treatment of an ordinary virus.’ Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Do you see that?</p>
<p><strong>harry reporter</strong>: What? … this seems to be Monroe
Park! That’s the career of Andy Ellerman, name of the man who checked
one-time Washington Andy out of the hospital! playgirl and erstwhile I’m
not sure that was the men… This is Heidi guy’s name. Robles reporting to
you</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes it was.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What did she say? San Dimas? Where’s San
Dimas?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Let’s call the T.V. station and find out.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is not the way you want to go about
this, honey.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell her, Soco. She shouldn’t mess with these
people.</p>
<p><strong>75 int. andy’s house - night 75</strong>: Joan comes out of
the bedroom with her purse and jacket and with Harry following, crosses
the living room:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Will you just once take the benefit of my
advice?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: First you tell me I go around acting too
timid…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, but this is a whole different situation
here…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And now when I suddenly feel like I could save
the Pope in an earthquake, you start trying to…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is not the Pope we’re talking about
here, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: That’s just a figure of speech.</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. andy’s house/driveway &amp; garage - night
76</strong>: Joan comes out the front door, Harry moving along beside
her, as she moves crossing briskly toward the garage:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dammit, Joan, these people are holding all
the cards. They’ll probably throw you into that bughouse with your
sister.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You want to go there and call ’em a bunch of
names, throw a lot of accusations at them? They don’t care. People with
that kind of money behind them, with their kind of connections, they
never go to jail, you never see them behind bars.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Am I getting through to you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. city streets - night 77</strong>: The Mercedes moves
along one of the surface streets with the ax handle still protruding
from its hood.</p>
<p><strong>78 int. joan’s mercedes - night 78</strong>: Joan, staring
grimly out the windshield as she snails along in the right-hand lane.
Harry begins shifting fitfully around, grumbling:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is just nuts, what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Will you stop trying to undermine me every
inch of the way.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look at this goddamned traffic.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Anyway, I didn’t ask you to drag along with
me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re the one that’s dragging along. Go
around the goddamned truck.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, just let me drive the goddamned car,
that’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Why should I let you drive?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why? I’ll tell you why, because you’re a
terrible driver, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, now all the ugly little truths are coming
out.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You operate this vehicle like it was a cane
with a red tip painted on the end of it.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Don’t talk to me, Harry. I mean it, just don’t
say another word to me!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I was doing just fine until you started in on
me…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in
your car…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And now look at me. I’ve got purpose
tremors…</p>
<p><strong>79 ext. freeway/int. joan’s car - night 79</strong>: He gives
up and moves back to the passenger door, passing a man in an adjacent
car, looking curiously from the ax handle to him:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is something the fuck bothering you, pal?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can I at least offer some advice?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good. Just barge into the place, honey, and
play the big hero. When he tells you your sister’s not there, what’re
you going to do, cry?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Okay. What?</p>
<p><strong>remote angle on harry and joan</strong>: He takes her by the
hand and leads the way over the grounds toward the rear quarters of the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. m.p. center/utility area - night 83</strong>: They
step inside a narrow hallway leading to one of the main corridors of the
hospital. As they edge past a laundry cart outside a utility room, Harry
releases her hand. She moves ahead, then experiencing a sudden loss of
nerve, stops and looks back to see Harry rummaging through the dirty
laundry.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. m.p. center/hallway - night 84</strong>: Harry, in a
white doctor’s jacket, with Joan at his side, move through a corridor.
As she glances nervously about, then at him:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: This isn’t going to work. You look like a
busboy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Excuse me, Nurse…</p>
<p><strong>long shot</strong>: ON Harry, Joan and Nurse One. Presently
the Nurse ges- tures to a stairwell leading to the second floor. Joan
and Harry move in the direction indicated.</p>
<p><strong>84a int. m.p. center/stairwell to 2nd floor hall
84a</strong>: PICKING UP Harry and Joan moving down the above hallway,
looking at the room numbers:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I hope you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t worry. Just do what I told you.</p>
<p><strong>84a continued: 84a</strong>: Harry reaches to the door, opens
it, ushers Joan inside and is about to follow, when:</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: Doctor! Just a minute please!</p>
<p><strong>harry’s pov - nurse</strong>: Approaching up the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: He takes a few steps towards her,
assuming his all-purpose scowl:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s the problem, dear?</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: We’re trying to contact Doctor Park, just
to be sure he’s authorized you to examine Mrs. Ellerman, because you
know, we have to follow certain…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I understand. You’re doing your job.</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: Where did your assistant…?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She had to step inside for a moment, to
relieve herself.</p>
<p><strong>85 int. m.p. center/andy’s bathroom - night 85</strong>: Joan
is now wearing Andy’s hospital gown, while Andy is hastily buttoning
herself into Joan’s blouse:</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And if this little kinglet of corporate shit
thinks he can get away with this, he’s greatly mistaken. Just wait ’til
he hears what I’m going to come out with now.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Put this on.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Remember when he passed me off as staff and I
was put on official government payroll all through Maui and the Yucatan
Mission?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, I don’t. And hurry up, will you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes you do, remember, when I almost died of
the vomito negro? Well that’s when he was doing all that illegal oil
drilling off the Mexican Gulf…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Have you got any lipstick?</p>
<p><strong>86 int. m.p. center/hallway - night 86</strong>: ON Harry and
the Nurse, as before:</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: I assume you’re a fairly recent associate
of the doctor’s?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s very correct.</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: Uhm hmmm… What do you specialize in?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’d say female troubles, mainly.</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: Oh, so Dr. Park feels there’s a
gynecological involvement here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sometimes he does, yes. By the way, did
anyone ever tell you what attractive eyebrows you have?</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: Oh, well, no, they haven’t…</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: Excuse me a minute, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: of Joan and Andy, the former whispering
urgently in ref- erence to the latter’s red hair:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What about her hair?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>on old man</strong>: now snoozing in the wheelchair. Harry’s
hand MOVES INTO FRAME and deftly removes his hat.</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: That was my superior. She tells me
Dr. Park is in surgery and she suggests that you wait in the
Administrative Lounge until we can get a hold of him. Would that be
alright?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>his pov of joan</strong>: Looking frightened at her imminent
abandonment.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t worry Mrs. Ellerman, we’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Harry takes her by the arm and looks
amiably toward the Nurse.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>nurse one</strong>: That way, Doctor, and thank you very much
for your patience.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>87 ext. m.p. center/parking lot - night 87</strong>: Harry,
outside the Mercedes, glancing around furtively, while inside the car,
Andy continues to perseverate about Red Layls as she struggles out of
Joan’s clothes:</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And this man, who wouldn’t know the truth if
it came up and spit him in the eye, is accusing me of lying…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You know what that prick had his lawyer say to
me?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That I was a pretty, grudge- bearing little
malcontent, grasping at some splinter of celebrity for myself at his
expense. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here, put this on.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I mean, the arrogance… What did she say your
name was?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Harry.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Have you got a cigarette, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Stay in the car. Don’t talk to anybody, and
I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. m.p. center/ grounds - night 88</strong>: Harry,
hurrying across the grounds to the rear of the hospital. Continental can
be seen pulling up and parking on a street bordering the hospital.
Moncrief, carrying a briefcase, and his chauffeur , get out and move</p>
<p><strong>89 ext. m.p. center - rear - night 89</strong>: Harry rounds
the corner of the hospital building and stops: Two male hospital
employees are smoking and conversing outside the door he had previously
entered with Joan.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Joan? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: He stands several feet below, looking up at
the window.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes, it’s me. Hurry up, will you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m having a little trouble getting back
in.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh great, Harry. What have you got me
into?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Don’t worry, honey…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You have to get me out of here!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Everything’s under control, just hang on a
few more minutes and I’ll be right back, okay?</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Andy? It’s Larry Moncrief.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Would you care to sit up for a minute? I’d
like to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>91 continued: 91</strong>: A sleek black car with opaque’d
windows pulls into a parking slot several yards away. A faded male
beauty, somewhere in his 50s, gets out of the rear passenger door and as
he moves to the walkway leading to the hospital grounds:</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>his pov of andy</strong>: Her hair still hidden under the
stingy-brim, her eyes unrecognizable behind the dark glasses.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Who the hell do you think it is?!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sweetheart? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No thanks to you, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Aw, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Harry turns and strides back toward
the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Before he arrives, I’d like you to take a
look at a list of certain deletions and expurgations, which if agreed
to…</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: … Red is, very generously, I think,
prepared to offer his sanction to a sanitized version of your book.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I think you should know, that if you push
this too far, you run the risk of having him withdraw his consent to
your well-being. I don’t think we want that, do we, Andy?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I can see that, Miss Spruance. Would you
care to tell me where she is?</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: She sits up, glancing uneasily at
Sturge, then attempts to assert herself boldly to Moncrief:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: As a matter of fact, she happens to be on her
way to the police right now, accompanied by a close friend of mine…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey? It’s me again.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I have to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Don’t say a word, Harry! I’m not alone!</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Sturge.</p>
<p><strong>pov of harry</strong>: standing below the window,
whispering:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Moncrief steps in beside Joan:</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I think you better come in here,
Mr. Bliss.</p>
<p><strong>on grounds - on harry</strong>: Muttering under his
breath:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Just go get Andy and leave, will you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I’m a little disappointed to find you
defaulting on our agreement.</p>
<p><strong>95 int. m.p. center/ andy’s hospital room - night
95</strong>: Joan looks from Moncrief to Harry:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What agreement?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Bullshit! I never agreed to anything! This
asshole approached me and tried to bribe me into working for them, and I
told him to go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I believe an agreement was implicit in
your acceptance of my check.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, you want to see your check?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh Harry, how could you…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, don’t go by anything this guy says,
because I’m the only one who knows what the hell I’m doing. It just
slipped my mind, I was going to tell you. See? I never cashed the
fucking thing!</p>
<p><strong>pov - harry and sturge - night</strong>: lurching about in a
grappler’s waltz below the window. In the b.g. the old man can be seen
leaning down to the walkway, picking up the stingy-brim hat and
returning it to his head. She turns from the window to see a subdued
Andy entering, her eyes showing signs of recent weeping. Behind her in
the hall, Moncrief can be seen greeting Red Layls.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No you’re not. What did that bastard do to
you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I need a Kleenex.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know what they’re trying to do, don’t you?
To force you into signing some kind of agreement that…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Wait, I want to tell you what he said to
me…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He said I was the only woman he’s ever really
cared for…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And when he said it… … he had a tear in his
eye…</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Well this moves to the top of the list,
Red, as one of your more stunning achievements.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Get me something cold to drink, will you?</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy, you don’t know what you’re saying.
You’re suffering from hostage syndrome or something.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, after all I do love him.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You ‘love’ him?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes, he’s been a very important man in my
life, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, now he’s not a fecal-faced, great white
shark!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t know where she got that. Will you
please keep your voice down. He’s very sensitive to what people say.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: ‘Sensitive’? Have you lost all your beads?!
This man had you kidnapped and kept in a drugged stupor for the last
three weeks, and now he’s…</p>
<p><strong>on harry</strong>: Stepping into the doorway, holding Struge
in a painful armlock:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Alright, what the hell’s going on in
here?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: That’s the dog trainer.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I thought he was working for us.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Well there seems to be a little grey area
there, Red.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Come over here, I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Mr. Layls…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Will you listen to me! This man is not only a
bastard, he’s a scummy, soul-less little thug and a criminal!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you implying that I have defective
judgement in men, Joanie?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just want a say, that though you’re someone
in a category I admire, you’ve gone to some lengths on this thing here,
that I don’t entirely agree with…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sit down. I have a neck condition and it
aggravates me to have to look up at you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But I want to go on and finish my thought on
this, because…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You know, I’m not in the best of health right
now, and I’ve been advised to avoid excitement…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So if you intend to do that… I might just have
to have my shock troops blow your brains out.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: More sugar.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And furthermore, this ‘sensitive’ man’s lawyer
more than implied they were willing to put your feet, as well as
probably mine, into a block of cement!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh that’s just all talk… Would somebody please
get me my clothes!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Just put yourself, Harry, for a moment, in the
shoes of a man whose sole intention is to leave the world a better place
than he found it, only to discover those intentions have been painfully
slandered by someone he’d given both his heart and his economic support
to, not to mention his trust…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uhm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Harry, I can’t believe you’re sitting there
nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not nodding my head, honey, I’m just
listening to the man.</p>
<p><strong>on andy</strong>: as Harry, in the b.g., resumes his exchange
with Red:</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Who is this guy, anyway? Isn’t he a little
sleazy, Joanie, a bit infra dig? I mean Lewie’s a bit of a stiff,
but…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You’re going to talk to me about sleaze, when
you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon, who was flicking his tongue
out at me like some rutting iguana, and groping at his naturalia at
three in the morning?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, ‘him.’</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh ‘him’?! He came at me with an ax!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, he’s very immature.</p>
<p><strong>on joan</strong>: As Moncrief steps up to her, offering a
glass of tea:</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Miss Spruance, would you care for a…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>on red</strong>: Raising a baleful eye to Joan:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I don’t know what kind of spell you’ve cast on
my sister, but it doesn’t extend to me…</p>
<p><strong>on joan</strong>: Standing above Layls:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: In fact, I’ve been to the police and I intend
to press charges against you…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, he’s not supposed to get excited.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: … Not only for having my apartment burglarized
but for breaking into Andy’s house, as well as hiring someone to
frighten, harass and intimidate me!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know, maybe you better not…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>harry joan</strong>: He’s got a bad neck… I’m not afraid of
these</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I never much cared for you, young lady. And I
find your display of anger both unattractive and unfeminine.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m not here to beg your good opinion…</p>
<p><strong>harry joan</strong>: … Red Layls or not, you … or to find out
don’t insult this party in the right amount of my presence.
attractiveness and</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Doctor Park is trying to reach you.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell him to hold on. First, you assume far more
interest in you on my part than exists. I had nothing whatsoever to do
with your supposed misfortunes…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I don’t believe you!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And as regards Andy’s house, I’d have no need
to break into Andy’s house, because I own Andy’s house.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I don’t care whose house you own, you’re
nothing but a slimy, mean- minded little hood!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Will you please stop interfering in my
personal life, Joanie.</p>
<p><strong>red andy</strong>: Go ahead. I just want to go out Red? I’ve
got good news. god sakes… We’ve found one for you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Andy, you know something?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: The kind of woman you are is a danger to the
kind of woman I am, so the next time you and your boyfriend have a
domestic spat, don’t call me!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well if you’re going to take this kind of
grumpy attitude, I certainly won’t.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Harry, where are my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>harry park</strong>: I think they must be I’m over at Poly-

<p><strong>harry park</strong>: Can I just talk to you for I’m not

I’ve taken a</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Will you people be quiet, I can’t hear this. Go
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>park</strong>: It’s as sound a muscular bag as I’ve ever seen
and the pericordium is a gorgeous color.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Well whose heart is it? Give me a profile.</p>
<p><strong>park</strong>: I don’t have any specific data, but the host
was around 35 and she was obviously very healthy.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Godammit, Monroe!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I told you I don’t want a woman’s heart!</p>
<p><strong>park</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s not going to change you in
any way.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How do you know?! You don’t know that!</p>
<p><strong>park</strong>: Look, let’s just get it done.</p>
<p><strong>harry park</strong>: In other words, you don’t And later if
you find trust me. you’re unsatisfied with</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Would you please get me my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: I wanted to tell you a moment ago, that I
was privileged to see you at the Bowl on the Fourth of July…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So what. I’m talking to this lady…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You can’t tell me what kind of a woman she
was?! And if she was so godammed healthy, why is she dead?!</p>
<p><strong>room - night</strong>: ON Moncrief, Joan and Harry.</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: And I was especially moved by your
rendition of ‘The Battle Hymn of The…’</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Never mind that shit. Tell her…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did I spend your money! Did I give you any
services for it. Tell this woman the truth, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>moncrief</strong>: Well, shall we start with the fact that
you’re a married man… … and then go on from there?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jesus Christ! What are you trying to do to
me!!</p>
<p><strong>99 continued: 99</strong>: She turns away from him and goes
toward the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait a minute, honey…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You know whose heart this body- snatcher is
trying to give me?! A victim of somebody called the Westside Slasher!
And this is the doctor you recommended to me! You’re killing me, Monroe!
You know that?! You’re pushing me to the goddamned wall!</p>
<p><strong>99a ext. m.p. center/hallway - night 99a</strong>: Joan moves
quickly down the hall, putting the doctor’s jacket on over her hospital
smock, with Harry following, trying desperately to explain:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, there’s a simple explanation to all of
this, if you want me to go into it… I was trying to tell you at
dinner…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Will you just stop for one minute and let me
talk to you… It’s very complicated…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What in the hell should I do?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well Red, better a woman than dead, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So let’s just go there, sweetheart, and have
him sew the darn thing in.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, you know, you live a life, honey, you
make some mistakes. You get married for maybe mutual benefits, or
business considerations weighing on you at the time, and because you
don’t think the right person is ever going to come along.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I would never have knowingly become involved
with a married man.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know that, that’s why I was trying to come
out and tell you…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Please, I don’t want to discuss it anymore. I
bet you never read Dante, either.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now there you’re 75 percent wrong.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I mean, I can’t believe it, that you’d lie to
me about this…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, I lied. Didn’t you ever tell a lie? If
not let me kiss your high heel.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m going in the house.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait. Can I call you tomorrow, just to see
how you’re feeling? Or how things are going?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I have a dress rehearsal tomorrow and a
concert on Friday. That’s all I care about right now.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And I don’t want to see you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t say that, please. I’m asking you to
just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life,
because…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: No. I didn’t extricate myself from the
infidelities of one man, just to fall into the arms of the prince of
prevaricators…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I may be all kinds of a son of a bitch,
and the prince of whatever, but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t, when it
comes down to it, stand up and take the bullet for you.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: That’s not what I observed, Harry.</p>

<p><strong>lee</strong>: Harry, I want my dog.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, Lee, how are you. I just this minute got
back from Vegas. I was dealing a couple of dogs to Paul Anka. I was
about to give you a call.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Don’t embarrass us both, man. Just give me the
dog back, and let’s preserve the friendship.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Lee, I’m in the neighborhood of getting my
hands on the money. I’m about to close a business deal with Vark
Zulethian of Zulethian Carpets, you’ve probably heard of him…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Come on, I know these dodges backwards and
forwards. I need the dog. He’s up for a TV series.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I don’t even want the ten thousand now,
compared to what he might appreciate to.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, our agreement was I could buy the dog
back. He’s the only thing I got to prove to people what I can do, and
all I’m asking you, Lee, is…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Don’t make me have to get legal with you,
Harry. You sold me the animal, then as a personal favor, I let you
borrow him, to demo to some V.I.P.. that probably don’t even exist. You
haven’t been straight with me, man. Just go get the dog.</p>
<p><strong>on duke and harry</strong>: as they come across the parking
lot to Lee’s van. Harry hands him the leash and Lee addresses Duke:</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Duke, geh im wagen.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Why don’t you take this dog, Harry. He’s green,
but maybe you could do something with him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, I don’t want the dog.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Go ahead, man. Take him. If you don’t want him,
pick up some change. Sell him for a pet.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do me one favor, will you? Say ‘owner’ if you
want to, but don’t say ‘trainer.’ I trained that dog.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Let me think about that, okay?</p>
<p><strong>101c int. meryl’s coffee shop - day 101c</strong>: Harry, in
a profound state of bereavement, as Vita fills a coffee cup in front of
him:</p>
<p><strong>vita</strong>: What do you want, Harry?</p>

<p><strong>vita</strong>: Do you want anything?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>joan</strong>: No, go ahead. I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, who’s going to drive you home?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’ll call a cab.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: I can take her home.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Good, because I don’t want you to be alone.

small town, where it’s friendly, and everybody knows each other, and
there are no bars on the windows…</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: And the milkman’s a child molester.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Thanks, Eddy.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: Well, it’s true. It doesn’t matter where you
live. Shit happens.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Are you in a bad mood or something?</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: No. I’m not in a bad mood. Not as bad as
yours.</p>

’86?</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: The night after we did a concert in Osaka?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Could you be more specific?</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: We had a few drinks in your room. And a
certain intimacy took place.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: And when I asked to see you the next night,
you know what you said? You were too tired and sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: That was witty of me.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: But you weren’t. Because an hour later, you
went into Lewie’s room and you didn’t come out.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, if you remember, I was in love with
Lewis around that time, which I confided to you, so you did know…</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: That’s not the reason.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Excuse me, Eddy, you just passed the turn off
to my street.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Eddy.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: I just want to drive a little, so we can
talk.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Anyway, if I remember correctly, we only
kissed. But if that led you to believe something that hurt you in any
way, I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It looks like somebody bit you.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: Somebody did.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, am I supposed to guess, or are you going
to…</p>

Jeep pitches about on its shocks as it moves up an incline graded
slightly higher than the one already giving Harry trouble. Eddy shifts
into four-wheel. Joan, jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them,
looks over at him:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Why did you do these things?</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: Because you deserved it.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I didn’t deserve it. I’ve always thought of
you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends…</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: I use to think very highly of you, too, but
now I don’t like what I see. In fact, it’s been very disturbing to me,
Joan. Very disillusioning. To see that before you’ve even gotten rid of
Lewie, you’ve started up with some other man.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Eddy, I want you to take me home now.</p>
<p><strong>y122 ext. dirt road - night y122</strong>: The Jeep pulls
onto a large dirt promontory situated above the city and makes a sharp
angle, bringing it to the edge of the brush and chaparral sloping down
into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: You know, there’s so many things about me you
have no idea of. You never ask me about my life or what I’m thinking,
because you have no interest…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes I do. You can tell me whatever you want
to, but let’s go back down to…</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: Creative things, and dreams, and feelings I
have, that Lewie or anyone else in your life, are not capable of…</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: See? You’re not genuinely interested. You’re
not at all sincere, Joan.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Eddy…</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: You present yourself like you are, but you’re
not… Don’t you think I know that, better than anybody?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: I want you to listen to me, and I want you to
kiss me. And this time, like you mean it…</p>

driver’s door suddenly opens and Harry, in the heat and fury of his

place on the precarious footing of the hillside, with Joan alternately
pulling at one and pushing at the other. The intensity and violence of
their struggle is such that she is knocked further down the incline.
Harry, quickly glances down the hill to see if she is alright and is
left open to severe blow by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his
car.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You bastards!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What are you people doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you crazy?! What are you doing, running
around with a guy like this!!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You maniacs!! You liars!! You shits!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are you yelling at me for?! This son of
a bitch is probably the Westside Slasher!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It looks like a domestic quarrel. Let’s get a
car up here quick.</p>
<p><strong>back to harry and joan</strong>: She is yelling at him:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m finished wagging my tail and leaving
little puddles on the floor…!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait a minute, honey…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And smiling on command, because I don’t give a
damn whether any of you like me or not!!!</p>

<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stand where you are, and put down the
knife.</p>
<p><strong>on joan</strong>: Perceiving the danger to Harry:</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Put the knife down, Harry!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why don’t you go harass someone else!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’ve got a bead on you, so just put it
down.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stay where you are, don’t go near him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just saved her life, you son of
bitches!!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Give me that thing.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: See? He’s not hurting me! He’s my friend!!
This is just for their benefit.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t touch her, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But that’s what I am, honey, your friend,
that’s what I wanted to tell you, and then I saw you with this guy…</p>

way.</p>

know, how important you are to me…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Step away from him, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And I needed you to know this one other thing
about me, because I don’t want to withhold anything from you
anymore…</p>

<p><strong>music over</strong>: Red Layls lies with a plastic tube up
