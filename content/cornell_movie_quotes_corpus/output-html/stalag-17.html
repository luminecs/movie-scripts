<h1 id="stalag-17">stalag-17</h1>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: I don’t know about you, but it
always make me sore when I see those war pictures – all about flying
leather- necks and submarine patrols and frogmen and guerillas in the
Philippines. I don’t want to take anything away from those guys, but
what gets me is that there never was a movie about P.O.W.s – about
prisoners of war. Now my name is Clarence Harvey Cook, – they call me
Cookie. I was shot down over Magdeburg, Germany back in 43. That’s why I
stammer a little once in a while, especially when I get excited and I
always get excited when I talk about Stalag 17. I spent two and a half
years in Stalag 17. Stalag is the Kraut word for prison camp and number
17 was somewhere near Krems on the Danube. There were about forty
thousand P.O.W.s there, if…</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: you bothered to count the Russians
and the Poles and the Czechs. In our Compound there were about six
hundred and thirty of us – all American airmen, all shot down by the
Krauts – radio operators, gunners and engineers – all sergeants. Now you
put six hundred and thirty sergeants together and boinnnnng! – you’ve
got yourself a situation! There was more fireworks shooting off around
that place! Take for instance the story about the spy we had in our
barrack. It was about a week before Christmas in ’44 and two of our guys
– Manfredi and Johnson to be exact – were just getting set to blow the
joint…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get up, Animal! Betty Grable’s on the
phone!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Here’s your civilian clothes, boys.</p>
<p><strong>manfredi</strong>: Okay, Hoffy.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Bury your Army outfits before you get out of
the forest.</p>
<p><strong>manfredi</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: The compass is the top button on your pants,
Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Anybody asks for your papers, you’re French
laborers.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Your map – your Kraut money – Swiss
francs.</p>
<p><strong>manfredi</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Now, let’s hear it once more, boys.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: We’ve been over it a hundred times.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Let’s hear it again.</p>
<p><strong>manfredi</strong>: We stick to the forest going west until we
hit the Danube –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Then follow the Danube up to Linz –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: In Linz we hop a barge and go all the way
to Ulm –</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Stop it, Joey – go to sleep!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Go on. You’re in Ulm.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Once in Ulm we lie low until night, then
take a train to Friedrichshafen.</p>
<p><strong>manfredi</strong>: Then once in Friedrichshafen we steal a
rowboat, get some fishing tackle, and start drifting across the lake –
always south – until we hit the other side – Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Bingo. Once in Switzerland, just give out
with a big yodel so we’ll know you’re there. It’s a breeze, boys.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Stay out of it, Sefton.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Just one question. Did you calculate the
risk?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You got ten minutes to get through the
tunnel. That’ll bring you out just when the Jerries are changing shifts.
Blondie?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Okay, boys – peel off.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: When you get going on those broads, think of
me!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Animal! Animal! Aren’t you ashamed of
yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you’re thinking of
broads. Broads?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: We’ll miss you, you cruds.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: They ought to be under the barbed wire
soon.</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Looks good outside.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I hope they hit the Danube before dawn.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: They got a good chance. This is the longest
night of the year.</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: I bet you they make it to Friedrichshafen all
right.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I bet they get all the way to
Switzerland!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: And I bet they don’t even get out of the
forest.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Now what kind of a crack is that?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they
don’t get out of the forest.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: That’s enough, Sefton. Crawl back into your
sack.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He’d make book on his own mother getting hit
by a truck!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Anybody call?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Go on, Sefton – butt out!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Wait a minute, Hoffy – I want to back those
kids. I’ll cover ten of that.</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: I’ll take five.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Eight.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Put me down for ten, you louse.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ll call the whole pot.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Whatever you say. Hey, Cookie – get me some
more cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here’s two and a half.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: No butts.</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m
–?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: That’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Speak up, boys. Any more sports in the
crowd?</p>
<p><strong>manfredi</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Filthy Krauts!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What slipped up, Hoffy?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Don’t ask me. Price was elected Security.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Okay, Security – what happened?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I wish I knew. We had everything figured out.
To the last detail.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Maybe the Krauts knew about that tunnel all
the time!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shut up, Animal!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Maybe they were layin’ for ’em out there!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Yeah. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots – so
who says they didn’t get away?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Anybody here wanna double their bet?</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: Funny thing about those Krauts. They
hated the sight of us yet they couldn’t wait to look at us again. Every
morning – at six on the dot – they’d have the Appell – that’s roll call
to you. Each barrack had its own alarm clock. Our alarm clock was Johann
Sebastian Schulz. I understand the Krauts had a composer way back with
the Johann Sebastian in it – but I can tell you one thing: Schulz was no
composer. He was a Schweinehund. Oh, Mother – was he ever a lousy
Schweinehund!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Aufstehen, gentlemen! Appell! Raus! Hurry
up!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You must get up for roll call! Raus, raus,
gentlemen! Everybody aufstehen! Raus!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: We heard you, Schulz! And good morning to you!
Aw, break it off! Why don’t you take that whistle and shove it! Tell the
Kommandant I’ve got dysentery! Shut up, Schulz – you’re talking to
sergeants of the United States Air Force! Look at this chilblain. Ain’t
it a beaut!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Raus! Raus! Aufstehen!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Come on, sack rats – cut the bitchin’ and get
up!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Say, Schulz – you guys had machine gun
practice last night?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice
boys. I’d better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You killed them, huh? Both of them?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Such nice boys! It makes me sick to –</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t wear it out!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Outside! You, too! Put away the
piccolo!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Los, los. Dummkopf!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Lay off, Schulz. He’s got a sickness. He’s
krank.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Sometimes I think he is fooling us with
that crazy business.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of
nine pals splattered all over your plane? C’mon Joey – don’t be
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not
want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Say, Schulz –</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Jawohl?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sprechen Sie deutsch?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Jawohl.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Then droppen Sie dead!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Ja – ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the
jokes! Droppen Sie dead!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Aufstehen! Appell!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get up, Animal. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good morning, Animal! What’ll it be for
breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny-
side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Stop it, Harry!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little
cocoa?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Why do you do this to me every morning?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake!
Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la
king!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I’ll kill you, Harry – so help me!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let go, Animal! It’s roll call! Hitler wants
to see you!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Good morning, Sefton.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Good morning, Schulz. And how’s Mrs. Schulz?
And all the little Schulzes?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Fine – fine!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Let us see. We have now two empty bunks
here. Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke
vier.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a
little – just out of decency?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are
cramped for space with new prisoners every day. Gentlemen! Outside!
Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Hey, Schulz – as long as you’re going to move
somebody in – how about a couple of those Russian broads?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Russian women prisoners?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Jawohl!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Some are not bad at all.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Just get us a couple with big
Glockenspiels.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: All right, men – fall in!</p>
<p><strong>german officer’s voice</strong>: Ach-tung! Abzaehlen!</p>
<p><strong>german lieutenant</strong>: Parade Atten-tion!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Guten Morgen, Sergeants!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Nasty weather we’re having, eh? And I
so much hoped that we could give you a white Christmas – just like the
ones you used to know… Aren’t those the words that clever little man
wrote – you know the one who stole his name from our capital – that
something-or-other Berlin?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Look at that mud. Come spring – and I
do hope you’ll still be with us next spring – we shall plant some grass
here – and perhaps some daffodils –</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Ich bitte!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Melde gehorchsamst: 628 Gefangene. Zwei
Mann fehlen in Baracke vier.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: I understand we are minus two men
this morning. I am surprised at you, gentlemen. Here I am trying to be
your friend and you do these embarrassing things to me. Don’t you know
this could get me into hot water with the High Command? They do not like
men escaping from Stalag 17 - especially, not enemy airmen from Compound
D. We plucked you out of the skies and now we must see to it you do not
fly away. Because you would come back and blast our cities again. The
High Command would be very angry with me. They would strip me of my
rank. They would courtmartial me, after all these years of a perfect
record! Now you wouldn’t want that to happen to me, would you?
Fortunately, those two men –</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: As I was saying: fortunately those
two men did not get very far. They had the good sense to rejoin us
again, so my record would stand unblemished. Nobody has ever escaped
from Stalag 17. Not alive, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest
the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead
prisoners are to be given a decent burial.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Of course. I’m aware of the Geneva
Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you
would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and
give them a twenty-one gun salute?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: For the last time, gentlemen, let me
remind you: any prisoners found outside the barracks after lights out
will be shot on sight. Furthermore, the iron stove in Barrack 4, the one
camouflaging the trap door, will be removed. And so that the men from
this barrack will not suffer from the cold, they will keep warm by
filling in the escape tunnel. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: All right, then, gentlemen. We are
all friends again. And with Christmas coming on, I have a special treat
for you. I’ll have you all deloused for the holidays. And I’ll have a
little tree for every barrack. You will like that.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Who did this?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: I will give the funny man exactly
five seconds to step forward.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Then you shall all stand here if it
takes all day and all night.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: That is better!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: I see! Six hundred funny men! …There
will be no Christmas trees! But there will be delousing. With ice water
from the hoses!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: ‘We will remove the iron stove – the one that
was camouflaging the trap door.’</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain’t
Kosher.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You can say that again!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m telling you, Animal – these Nazis ain’t
Ko –</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I said say it again. I didn’t say repeat
it.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Private property, bub.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How come the Krauts knew about that stove,
Security? And the tunnel? How come you can’t lay down a belch around
here without them knowing it?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Look – if you don’t like the way I’m handling
this job –</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Kill it, Duke. It’s got us all spinning.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I just want to know what makes those Krauts so
smart.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Maybe they’re doin’ it with radar. Maybe they
got a mike hidden some place.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Right up Joey’s ocarina.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Or maybe it’s not that they’re so smart. Maybe
it’s that we’re so stupid. Maybe there’s somebody in our barracks that’s
tipping ’em off! One of us!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A
dirty, stinkin’ stoolie!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Is that Einstein’s theory? Or did you figure
it out yourself?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.</strong>: New dames in the Russian compound!</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.s</strong>: Yee-ow! Tovarich! Tovarich! Oh you
sweethearts! Let’s open the third front! Hey, Minks – Pinsk! How about
some borscht – the two of us!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Hey – Russki – Russki! Look at those
bublichkis! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya – Otchi
Tchorniya!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Chewing gum – chewing gum!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Look at me! I’m your baby! Get a load of that
blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey – Comrade! Over here! This is Harry
Shapiro – the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Lay off! The blonde is mine!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Hey, Olga – Volga – wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Zurueck oder wir schiessen! Zurueck!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Let me go! Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They’ll shoot you, Animal!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I don’t care! Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s chow, Animal! Chow!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over
there!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No you don’t! You don’t want any broads with
boots on!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I don’t care if they wear galoshes!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You want Betty Grable!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Betty Grable!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Animal! When the war’s over, remember I told
you I’d fix you up with Betty Grable!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty
Grable?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How? We go to California. I got a cousin
that’s working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That’s how we get the
address, see? Isn’t that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the
doorbell and say, ‘Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the
girl we’d most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I’m here to
present the award’.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: What’s the award?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What d’ya think, jerko! You’re the award!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Me? What if she don’t want me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If she don’t want you, she don’t get
anything.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You’re teasing me again!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let go, Animal! It’s chow! We’ll miss
chow!</p>
<p><strong>1st g.i.</strong>: What’s this stuff anyhow? Manicure
water?</p>
<p><strong>2nd g.i.</strong>: This is what I like – a hearty meal.</p>
<p><strong>3rd g.i.</strong>: They finally found the formula: an Ersatz
of an Ersatz.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What’s holding up the parade?</p>
<p><strong>4th g.i.</strong>: Are you supposed to drink this stuff or
shave?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Drink. Shave.</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: Anyone else want potato soup?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Chow! Where’s the chow!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Take your socks outa my breakfast!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, Animal.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head.
Gotta wind up with athlete’s stomach.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Set ’er up, Cookie. I’m starved.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Easy, Animal! Easy!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Where’d that come from?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: From a chicken, bug-wit.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: A chicken?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t you remember, Animal? A chicken lays
those things.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: It’s beautiful! You goin’ to eat it all
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Uh-huh. The yellow and the white.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Is it all right if we smell it?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Just don’t drool on it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re not going to eat the eggshells?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Thanks. You’re a real pal! What’re we goin’
to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: If I were you, Sefton, I’d eat that egg some
place else. Like for instance under the barrack.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: A little weak today.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Come on, Trader Horn! Let’s hear it: what’d
you give the Krauts for that egg?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone
up.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: That wouldn’t be the cigarettes you took us
for last night?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What was I going to do with them? I only
smoke cigars.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and
Johnson last night and today he’s out trading with them.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on
account of they’re going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat
it in peace?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Ain’t that too bad! Tomorrow he’ll have to
suck a raw egg!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He don’t have to worry. He’ll trade the
Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What’s your beef, boys? So I’m trading.
Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that
makes me a collaborator.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: A lot sharper, Sefton! I’d like to have some
of that loot you got in those footlockers!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You would, would you? Listen, Stupe – the
first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my
blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain’t no
Salvation Army – this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You stink, Sefton!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Come off it! Both of you!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Now you’ve done it. You’ve given me nervous
indigestion. Anything else bothering you, boys?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just one little thing. How come you were so
sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn’t get out of the forest?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I wasn’t so sure. I just liked the odds.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: And what’s that crack supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: They’re lying dead in the mud out there and
I’m trying to find out how come.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I’ll tell you how come. The Barrack Chief
gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it’d be
safe. That’s how come.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What’re you guys trying to prove anyway?
Cutting trap doors! Digging tunnels! You know what the chances are to
get out of here? And let’s say you do get all the way to Switzerland! Or
say to the States? So what? They ship you to the Pacific and slap you in
another plane. And you get shot down again and you wind up in a Japanese
prison camp. That’s if you’re lucky! Well, I’m no escape artist! You can
be the heroes, the boys with the fruit salad on your chest. Me – I’m
staying put. And I’m going to make myself as comfortable as I can. And
if it takes a little trading with the enemy to get me some food or a
better mattress or a woman – that’s okay by Sefton!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why you crud! This war’s going to be over some
day – then what do you think we’ll do to Kraut-kissers like you?</p>
<p><strong>marko’s voice</strong>: At ease! At ease!</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: AT EASE!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Break it off, boys! At ease for the news!</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Today’s Camp News! Father Murray announces
that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held
at seven in the morning!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You can tell Father Murray to –</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack
rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote.
At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool.
See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack
Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for
the pinochle championship of the camp.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s a fix.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: At ease! Tuesday afternoon at two o’clock all
men from Texas will meet behind the north latrine.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: At ease! Next: A warning from Kommandant von
Scherbach. Anybody found throwing rocks at low-flying German aircraft
will be thrown in the boob. At ease! At ease! Are the doors covered?</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Okay, Steve. Give ’em the radio.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: You can keep it for two days.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Two days? We’re supposed to have it for a
week!</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: You’re lucky to get it at all. The boys are
afraid the Jerries’ll find it here. This barrack is jinxed.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Take some men and get the antenna going.
Let’s see if we can catch the BBC.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: What about those guys last night? What gives
in this barrack anyway?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Just a little sickness. Somebody around here’s
got the German measles.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: He oughta know. He went to Johns Hopkins. He
used to be a bedpan.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: What’s the gag?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: At ease! At ease!</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Be sure to put down the news. Looks like the
Germans have started a counter-offensive and the other barracks want to
know.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Getting anything?</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Getting too much. I’m tryin’ to
unscramble.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: If you can’t get the BBC, how about getting
Guy Lombardo?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Are we boring you?</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Hold it… Quiet…</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: …has driven across Luxemburg… The second
German wedge is reported fourteen miles west of Malmedy where tank
columns cut the road to Bastogne… the Allied Air Force is grounded by
poor visibility…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wunderbar! Isn’t he wunderbar!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: He’s the grrrrreatest!</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: …five Panzer divisions and nine infantry
divisions of von Rundstedt’s army have poured into the wide breach…
meanwhile two of Patton’s tank units have been diverted toward Bastogne
and are trying to –</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Static!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Static is right! The radio’s static, Patton’s
static, we’re static!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Maybe it’s going to be a longer war than you
figured – eh, Duke?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Yeah. We were just passing out guns.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Always joking. Always making
wisecrackers!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his
English? In a pretzel factory?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You always think I am a square. I have been
to America. I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I
will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You should live so long.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: This is me in Cincinnati.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Who’s the other wrestler? The one with the
mustache?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: That is my wife.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Look at all that meat. Isn’t she the bitter
end!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Give it back. You must not arouse
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose
you help us escape. We’ll go home and have everything ready for you in
Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of
Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Droppen Sie dead! Raus mit dem Ofen. Los!
Los!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: All right, gentlemen! We will now all go
outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the
tunnel which you digged.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Why don’t we just plug up that tunnel – with
the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: It is not me. It is the orders. I am your
friend. I am your best friend here.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Cut out the guff, Schulz. We’re on to you. You
know everything that’s happening in this barrack. Who’s tipping you
off?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Tipping me off? I do not understand.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You’re wasting your time, Duke. Outside,
everybody! Let’s get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he’s our
best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the
information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel?
Who’s giving it to you? Which one of us is it?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Which one of you is what?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Which one of us is the informer?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You are trying to say that an American
would inform on other Americans?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s the general idea. Only it’s not so
general as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You are talking crazy!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: No use, Schulz. You might as well come
clean. Why don’t you just tell ’em it’s me. Because I’m really the
illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you’ll
make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You Americans! You are the craziest people!
That’s why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a
nice German Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why don’t we accept, Animal? The worst that
can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Raus! Raus! All of you!</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: He was the Beast of Bavaria all
right, as we pieced it together later. And there was a stoolie in our
barrack, just as Duke said. They had a very simple communications system
– Schulz and the stoolie…</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: That’s how the Krauts knew about the
tunnel, from the day we started digging. Those poor suckers Manfredi and
Johnson! They got out of Stalag 17 sure enough, only not quite the way
they wanted to go.</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: As for the stoolie, I just wish he
had German measles because when you get the measles you break out all
over in red spots, and we could have pegged him easy. As it was it could
have been anybody in our outfit – Duke or Hoffy or Price or Goofy Joey
or Harry or the Animal or maybe Sefton. Sergeant J.J. Sefton. I guess
it’s about time I told you a few more things about that Sefton guy. If I
was anything of a writer I’d send it in to the Reader’s Digest for one
of those ‘Most Unforgettable Characters You’ve Ever Met’…</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: …he was a B.T.O., Sefton was. A Big
Time Operator. Always hustling, always scrounging. Take for instance the
horse races. Every Saturday and Sunday he would put on horse races. He
was the sole owner and operator of the Stalag 17 Turf Club. He was the
Presiding Steward, the Chief Handicapper, the Starter, the Judge, the
Breeder and his own bookie. He was the whole works, except that I was
the stable boy for ten smokes a day.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Step up, boys! The horses are at the
post!</p>
<p><strong>g.i.s</strong>: Five on Equipoise! Give me Equipoise – ten on
the nose! Two on Twenty Grand! Schnickelfritz for me. Five smackers!
Equipoise – one solid pack!</p>
<p><strong>last g.i.</strong>: Five on Seabiscuit! Pay you when the Red
Cross parcels come in.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: No credit.</p>
<p><strong>unkempt bum</strong>: Have a heart, Sefton!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Sorry. It’s against the rules of the Racing
Commission. Already? Any more bets? Shake ’em up, Cookie!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Let ’er go! They’re off and running at
Stalag 17!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Equipoise! Oh, you beauty! This way! This
way!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you,
Animal?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Come on, baby! Daddy’s going to buy you a
hunk of cheese!</p>
<p><strong>stosh and harry</strong>: Straighten out, you dog! This way!
That’s no horse – that’s a dervish! Please! This way! Come to Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: The winner is No. 5: Schnickelfritz!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz!
Why’d you make me bet on Equipoise!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I clocked him this morning. He was running
like a doll.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You clocked him! Why don’t I clock you?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: The next race will be a claiming race for
four months old and upward which have not won since November 17th.</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: It’s a good thing nobody ever asked
for a saliva test. Because I wouldn’t have put it past Sefton to stiff a
horse once in a while – especially when the betting was heavy.</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: Another one of his enterprises was
the distillery. Believe it or not, he ran a bar right in our barrack,
selling Schnapps at two cigarettes a shot. The boys called it the
Flamethrower, but it wasn’t really that bad. We brewed it out of old
potato peels and once in a while a couple of strings off the Red Cross
parcels, to give it a little flavor.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: It’s not fair, Harry. I’m telling you, it’s
not fair! She’s been married for over a year! My Betty! She had a baby!
Didn’t you hear it on the radio!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: C’mon, Animal! Pull yourself together! Hey,
Cookie! Belt us again!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Look at her! Isn’t she beautiful! Married an
orchestra leader!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So what? There’s other women!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Not for me! Betty! Betty!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Cut it out. Animal! I’ll fix you up with a
couple of those Russian women!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You’ll fix me up!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure, Animal! I’ll get you over there!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get
over there and they shot him in the leg!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us
a little gimmick.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sharp. Sometimes I’m so sharp it’s
frightening.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: To the Brick Kremlin!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: She’ll never forgive me!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Bombs away!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are you serving today? Nitric acid?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: I only work here. Talk to the
Management.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: All right, Management. What are you trying to
do? Embalm us while we’re alive?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Exactly what did you expect for two
cigarettes? Eight year old Bottled- In-Bond? All the house guarantees is
that you don’t go blind. Don’t ever serve ’em again.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Blind! Harry! Harry!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Harry – I’m blind!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I
drank the stuff myself.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Animal! Animal! Where are you, Animal?</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: The killer-diller, of course – the
real bonanza – was when Sefton put up the Observatory. He scrounged
himself some high-powered Kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror and got
Ronnie Bigelow from Barrack 2 to put the whole shebang together for a
pound of coffee. On a clear day you could have seen the Swiss Alps, only
who wanted to see the Swiss Alps? It was about a mile away, that Russian
delousing shack, but we were right on top of it. It cost you a cigarette
or a half bar of chocolate a peek. You couldn’t catch much through that
steam, but believe you me, after two years in that camp just the idea
what was behind that steam sure spruced up your voltage.</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: Let’s go! Thirty seconds to a customer.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.</strong>: Hey, Sefton – what’s snarling up the
traffic? By the time we get to look they’ll be old hags!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Simmer down, boys. There’ll be a second show
when they put the next batch through.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What’s the big idea, Sefton? Take that
telescope out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Says me.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You take it out. Only you’re going to have a
riot on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Every time the men get Red Cross packages you
have to think up an angle to rob them.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: When the Krauts find that gadget they’ll
throw us all in the boob.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: They know about that gadget. I’d worry more
about the radio.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I suppose they also know about your distillery
and the horseraces?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Just what makes you and them Krauts so
buddy-buddy?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Ask Security. You tell him, Price. You’ve
got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven’t you found out
yet?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Answer the question. How do you rate all
those privileges?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent
of the take.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: And maybe a little something else?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: A little something what?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe a little information!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Break it off!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How much more do we have to take from him?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: There’ll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I’m
Barrack Chief.</p>
<p><strong>g.i. voices</strong>: Hey, look at them! It’s Harry and the
Animal! Look what they’re doing!</p>
<p><strong>g.i.s</strong>: Those crazy jerks! They won’t get away with
it! The Krauts will shoot them!</p>
<p><strong>g.i.s</strong>: They’re past the fifty yard line! Quarterback
sneak! Look at them go!</p>
<p><strong>six g.i.s</strong>: We want a touchdown! We want a touchdown!
We want a touchdown!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Those idiots! They’ll paint themselves into
their graves!</p>
<p><strong>german guard</strong>: Was ist denn hier los? Sie sind
verhaftet!</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: Now let me see, what came next? Oh,
yes. Next came those new prisoners. ’Twas two days before Christmas when
all through the camp, not a creature was stirring, not even that
lamp.</p>
<p><strong>marko’s voice</strong>: At ease! At ease!</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Mail call!</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: At ease! At ease! First, the Kommandant is
sending every barrack a little Christmas present. A copy of Mein Kampf.
In the words of Oberst von Scherbach: ’Now that a German victory is in
sight, all American prisoners are to be indoctrinated with the teachings
of der Fuehrer. Unquote. In my own words: Unquote.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s the wrong direction.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You must have been some tail gunner! Go
ahead, Cookie.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Come on, let’s get that mail. Anything for
Stanislaus Kuzawa?</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: At ease! At ease!</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Martin. Shapiro. Price. Trzcinski. McKay.
Shapiro. Shapiro. Manfredi.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Shapiro. Musgrove. McKay. Peterson. Cook.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Nothing for Kuzawa?</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Shapiro. Shapiro.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Just what makes you so popular?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frightening, isn’t it? Fifty million guys
floating around back home and all those dames want is Sugar-lips
Shapiro.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: McKay, Agnew. Here, Stosh.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Give this to Joey, will you?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: At ease! At ease! Here’s a little something
from Father Murray. One to each barrack.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: And he says he wants you cruds to cut out all
swearing during Yuletide.</p>
<p><strong>g.i.</strong>: How’d he get those trees?</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: I don’t know. Prayed, I guess. They grew out
of his mattress.</p>
<p><strong>g.i.</strong>: What’ll we use for decorations?</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: For that you got to pray yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: ‘…and we do hope that you will finish that
last year of law school when you come back home…’ Law school?! You don’t
want to be a stinking lawyer with a stinking brief case in a stinking
office, do you, Joey?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: ‘…And do keep writing, son. Your letters are
very dear to us. With all our love, Dad.’ Here, Joey, take it.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: It’s from your Dad, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: The next time we write to your folks, Joey,
you know what you’re going to say? You’re going to say you don’t want to
be a lawyer any more. You want to be a musician – like play the flute,
maybe – eh, Joey?</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: I believe it! I believe it!</p>
<p><strong>g.i.</strong>: You believe what?</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: My wife. ‘Darling, you won’t believe it, but I
found the most adorable baby on our doorstep and I have decided to keep
it for our own. Now, you won’t believe it, but it’s got exactly my eyes
and nose…’ Why does she always say I won’t believe it? I believe it!</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: This is from my mother. ‘I saw a wonderful
article on German prison camps in one of the magazines. They showed
pictures of the tennis courts and they also say that in the winter they
freeze them over so you boys can ice skate…’</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Anything about us grouse hunting in the Vienna
woods?</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: ‘…In a way I’m glad you’re not in America
right now – with everything rationed here, like gas and meat.’</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Heart-rendering, ain’t it? Why don’t we send
them some food parcels?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: What do those broads say?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What do they always say?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: That’s what I wanna hear.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s not good for you, Animal.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Hey! This is with a typewriter! It’s from a
finance company!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So it is from the finance company. So it’s
better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the
Plymouth. So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh.
So they want the Plymouth.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is a good one! Shut up, everybody!
Listen to this! ‘The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro.
Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby
notified to report…’ What do you know! So now I’m a draft evader!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: This is it, gentlemen. Don’t bother to scrape
your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Okay, gang! Meet our new guests. This is
Lieutenant Dunbar and this is Sergeant Bagradian.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar and bagradian</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Lieutenant?!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Knock it off, boys. The pleasure’s all
mine.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: The Lieutenant will be with us for a week or
so until the Krauts can ship him to the officers’ camp in Silesia. Looks
like all the railroad lines out of Frankfurt are fouled up because
somebody blew up an ammunition train.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Somebody, my eye. The Lieutenant did it –
right in the station – with fifty German guards around.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well! Glad to have you with the
organization!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You’re just in time for the Christmas
Pageant.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Looks more like the lost company of
Tobacco Road.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w. with barrack bags</strong>: He’s an actor. You should
see him do imitations. He can imitate anybody.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If he can imitate a girl, he’s made.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.</strong>: Hey – do Lionel Barrymore.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Do Grable.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Stop it, boys. They were shot down two days
ago and they’ve been on their feet ever since. Fix them some tea, will
you? Price will show you your bunks.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We had a couple of unexpected vacancies.
Which one will it be – the upper or lower, Lieutenant Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn’t be James
Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes, it would. Do we know each other?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: He’s from Boston, too. But you wouldn’t know
him, not unless you had your house robbed.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Maybe he would. We applied for Officers’
Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I’m glad to see
you made it. Of course, it couldn’t be that all that dough behind you
had something to do with it! His mother’s got twenty million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: They’ve got a summer house in Nantucket,
with an upstairs polo field. You better put a canopy over his bunk.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Lay off, Sefton.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: With your mother’s pull, how come you’re not
a chicken colonel by now?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Lay off, I said – if you don’t want your head
handed to you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tea is being served on the verandah!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Where are the napkins, Animal?</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Do be seated, Bonita. What a perfectly
charming table arrangement. They must have copied it from House
Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Animal! How many times have I told you, you
got to pour from the left!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dinner will be served at seven sharp. Black
tie.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Where’d they get you, Lieutenant? Over
Frankfurt?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: On the Schweinfurt run.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: How many ships did you lose?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Half the group.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Flying out of England?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes. Paddington, 92nd Bomber Group.</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Hey, Lieutenant. How did you blow up that
train with fifty guards around?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Just lucky, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Don’t let him kid you. Cagney couldn’t
have pulled a sweeter job. All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot
in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the
longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in
the men’s room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window
and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then,
he comes out like nothing’s happened and three minutes later you can
hear it – boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: I wouldn’t talk about things like that.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: They never caught on.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: They may. That’s why I would keep my mouth
shut.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: We’re all Americans here!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The Krauts have a way of getting
information.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Especially in this barrack.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: That’s what we’d like to know.</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: There’s only one pair left.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: We’ll get some more.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Where does a guy take a hot shower around
here?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Hot showers? Dig him!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Sorry. No hot showers. You wash in the
latrine.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Latrine?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What did you expect, glamor boy? The
Officers’ Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks
before and I let them slide. But I don’t intend to take any more. If you
resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won’t help
you here. Because here you’re on your own. And no mother to throw you a
lifebelt. Now let’s see how good you can swim.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Sorry, boys, but my taxi’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Plenty.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Number one on the rat parade!</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: It was a funny thing about Sefton
and me. I guess I knew him as well as anybody else in the camp because I
had worked for him for two years. But there were lots of things I didn’t
know about him. Take for instance, where he would disappear to once in a
while. Of course, I had a hunch, but it seemed so crazy I couldn’t quite
believe it – Just as I would never have believed that Sefton was the guy
that would give away Lieutenant Dunbar for blowing up that ammunition
train.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Cut the horseplay, Harry. What’s the matter
with you guys?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: And don’t blame me if you all wind up in the
cooler.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: How’s two?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Get ready! Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Attention!</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Heil, Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Heil, Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Droppen Sie dead.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Quiet! We are indoctrinating! Is you all
indoctrinated?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.s</strong>: Jawohl.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Is you all good Nazis?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.s</strong>: Jawohl.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Is you all little Adolfs?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.s</strong>: Jawohl!</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von
und zu Schulz! About face!</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.s</strong>: Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg Heil!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Ach! One Fuehrer is enough! Now please,
gentlemen! Take off the mustaches immediately. Or do you want me
arrested by the Gestapo?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.s</strong>: Jawohl!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You would be very sorry to get a new
Feldwebel. Somebody without a sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Okay, boys. Wipe off the mustaches. Now what
is it, Schulz?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man
is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the
International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you
very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the
wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also
span.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: We’ll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: The Kommandant also sends you clean
blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: We know! We got them last year. Five minutes
after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant
told me to pick up the radio.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What radio?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: The one you are hiding in the barrack,
don’t you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all
over the compound.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Schulz, you’re off your nut!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Give me the radio.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We have no radio.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: All right, gentlemen, I will find it
myself. Now let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Am I cold? Am I getting warmer? Hot, maybe?
Very hot?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: What is this? This is water?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s a mouse trap.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: My grandmother’s ear-muffs.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a
clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: We sort of hope you’ll laugh yourselves to
death.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Now, outside everybody, for the blankets!
Everybody out!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Outside! You, too!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That Schulz pig. I’ll get him yet.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You hold him. I’ll slug him.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: It’s not Schulz. It’s that stoolie. Whoever
he is, he’s sure batting a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where’s
Sefton? You haven’t seen Sefton, have you?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: No, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>german guard</strong>: Der Naechste!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Henkel! Krause! I’m very sorry about the
mouse trap, but the war news are very depressing anyway.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: I might as well also confiscate the
antenna.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: American know-how!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: All right, Cookie, let’s hear it: where is
Sefton?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: I don’t know. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: He wouldn’t be at the Kommandant’s, would
he?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What did they trade him for the radio?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why don’t we just look in those
footlockers?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them
keys.</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: I haven’t got any keys.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Okay. Then I’ll get me a key.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Okay, Hoffy?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Of all the hoarding cruds!</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Looks like Macey’s basement, don’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: That kid’s richer than my mother.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: For cryin’ out loud! What would he be doing
with these?</p>
<p><strong>duke’s voice</strong>: Suppose you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Go on, ask me! Because I got the goods on
Mister Sefton. Because this time he didn’t shake me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Take a look for yourself. It’ll curdle your
guts.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: The Russian women!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Try the end barrack. Where the goodies
are.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, Hoffy! We all want to see!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: How did he get over there?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the
guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: This is murder!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Go play with your marbles!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: The stinkin’ miser! Keeping all that to
himself!</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: Would I like to lay my hands on him!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who wants to lay their hands on him?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: So I’m a vigilante, huh? So what are the
Barrack Officers going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t worry Duke. We’ll handle it from here
on in.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You better handle it fast. Before a few more
of us get knocked off.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Too late for chow?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What’s the matter, boys? Is my slip
showing?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: I’ll say it is. You spilled a little borscht
on it.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Borscht?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Have a nice time over there?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Oh! Somebody was peeking!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Yeah! Had a dreamy time! Those dames, they
really know how to throw a party. I’ve handled some pretty interesting
material in my day, but between you and me, there’s just nothing like
the hot breath of the Cossacks. There’s a couple of blonde snipers over
there, real man-killers…</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What happened, Cookie? Who did it?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: We did it.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: There better not be anything missing. This
is private property.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: So was the radio private property. So was
Manfredi and Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What about the radio?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, what about it? Cut the horsing around.
We know he’s the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let’s get on
with it.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Let’s get on with what? What is this anyway?
A Kangaroo Court? Why don’t you get a rope and do it right?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You make my mouth water.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You’re all wire happy, boys. You’ve been in
this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four.
Only it ain’t four.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What’s it add up to you, Sefton?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong
guy. Because I’m telling you. The Krauts wouldn’t plant two stoolies in
one barrack. And whatever you do to me you’re going to have to do all
over again when you find the right guy.</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Watch it!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Good evening, Sergeants. A bit dank
in here, isn’t it?… Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: You have a Lieutenant here…</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: …a Lieutenant James Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I am Lieutenant Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: What is your number?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: 105-353.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: That is correct. Lieutenant Dunbar, I
came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we
never put officers up with enlisted men.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’ll live.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Quite a transportation jam we are
having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be
even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don’t
you think so, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about,
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Of course you don’t. Now, Lieutenant,
how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire
going.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’m okay here. Why bother?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: No bother. I’m very grateful for a
little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Ever try forty sleeping pills?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Abfuehren!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Wait a minute. We have some rights here. Why
is this man being taken out?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Curtains would do wonders for this
barrack. You will not get them.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: How did he ever find out about that
ammunition train?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You must have shot off your mouth all the way
from Frankfurt to here.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: We did not.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: I don’t have to think. We didn’t tell
anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What are you looking at me for?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I suppose some jerk’s going to say I did
it.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Why don’t you try it one at a time?</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: Now, there’s a lot of folks around
these days that don’t believe in Santa Claus. I always did and I always
will. For a while there, I thought the German Luftwaffe had shot him
down, reindeer, sleigh and all. But, no sir! Come the day before
Christmas, he showed up with some presents for us, the Geneva Man did.
He had started out with seven truckloads. He was lucky to get one of
them through – with all the bombing and booby traps and pilfering.
Still, they were presents and made you feel good: coffee, a little sugar
and some candy and toothbrushes and about a thousand rolls of that
sanitary paper. Brother, they sure kept sending us reams of that stuff.
I’ll bet you if they had dropped all that paper on Berlin the first day,
the war would have been over right then and there.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Schnell! Schnell! Bevor der Mann vom Roten
Kreuz inspizieren kommt!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Nehmen Sie das hinaus!</p>
<p><strong>sefton’s voice</strong>: Hey, Schulz!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: What is this? You must get out of the bunk.
The Geneva Man is coming to inspect the barrack!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a
fight?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: How would you like to give Frau Schulz a
pair of silk stockings for Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I
can – Silk stockings?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Here. Take them.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for
my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village –</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: And how about three hundred cigarettes for
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you
want from me?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Who’s the guy, Schulz?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: What guy?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: The one you work with. Who is he? How do you
do it?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: I do not want those cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Yes, you do!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I’ll make it five hundred!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You’d better talk, Schulz, because I’m going
to find out with you or without you. Because I won’t let go for a
second. Because they’ll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Talk what? I do not know anything!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: How many do you want? A thousand?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Take it! Take it!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Gentlemen! When the Geneva Man comes
through the barrack, I don’t want any funny business. No mustaches. We
will all behave ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: And gentlemen! You will not complain to the
Geneva Man. Because I have orders from the Kommandant to report everyone
who complains.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Look at him! Dunbar’s being crucified and
he’s trading again!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Didn’t you get enough last night? You itching
for more?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Some guys never learn!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: I called a meeting of the barrack chiefs this
morning, Sefton. I thought maybe I could get you transferred into
another barrack. It turns out nobody likes you any more than we do.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: So you’re stuck with me, eh?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Maybe those Russian dames would take him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not with that kisser – not any more!</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: Here… put some ice on it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Beat it, stooge! Go on – tell the crumb where
he stands.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: All right, Sefton. You got away lucky last
night. One more move, no matter how small, and you’ll wake up with your
throat slit!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You heard that, Sefton?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Sure I heard it. I still got one good
ear.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Achtung! Achtung! Everybody at attention
for the Geneva Man!</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: As you were, gentlemen. Please.</p>
<p><strong>german lieutenant</strong>: Here we have a typical barrack.
It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk,
naturally.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Naturally. It would be rather awkward to
have three men in one bunk.</p>
<p><strong>german lieutenant</strong>: As for the blankets, you will
notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: They also smell of moth balls. When were
they issued? This morning?</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: What do you do for heat in this barrack?
No stove?</p>
<p><strong>german lieutenant</strong>: The men here used it for a trap
door, so we had to remove it temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: How long is temporarily? I trust not
until July.</p>
<p><strong>german lieutenant</strong>: Here you see a typical meal the
prisoners are getting. What are we having today, Schulz?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Bean soup with ham hocks. Would you like to
taste it? Where’s the ham hock? There should be a ham hock.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: When he finds it, we’ll send it to
Geneva.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Are there any complaints? Please speak
up.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Don’t be afraid to talk. That’s what the
Geneva Convention is for: to protect the rights of prisoners of war.
Whether they are Americans or Germans.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: What have you got to say?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I like it here. Aeh!</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s all right. Considering.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: What happened to you? Were you beaten?
Why don’t you answer? What did you do to this man?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: They didn’t do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Who beat you?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Nobody beat me. We were playing pinochle.
It’s a rough game.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Pardon me, sir. Since you want us to speak
up, there was a man removed from this barrack last night. A Lieutenant
Dunbar. We sure would appreciate your looking into it. That’s if they
haven’t shot him yet.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Why was the man arrested?</p>
<p><strong>german lieutenant</strong>: Sabotage. He blew up a train.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: They’d have to prove that first, wouldn’t
they? Isn’t that what the Geneva Convention says? You can’t just take a
man out and shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: You have no idea how boring my life
here is. If it weren’t for an occasional air raid or some foolish
prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn’t know what to do. I want to thank
you for keeping me company. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t read.
I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to
lose you.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I didn’t do it – I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Of course you did! Twenty-six
carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running
around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von
Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: You are being rude again.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on
that couch.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger
should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good
news?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Hauptkommando Berlin. General von
Pfeffinger. Dringend.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: I hope you appreciate this moment,
Lieutenant. You see, I am a cavalry man. All the von Scherbachs were
cavalry men. Well, you know what happened to the cavalry. The young ones
they put into panzer divisions. The older ones they put in the
quartermaster’s corps. Or they made them recruiting officers or wardens.
Like me. Wet nurses to putrid prisoners. In Berlin they have forgotten
that Colonel von Scherbach even exists. They will remember now!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Berlin? Hier Oberst von Scherbach.
General von Pfeffinger? Oberst von Scherbach. Stalag 17. Melde
gehorchsamst haben als Gefangenen den Mann, der Munitionszug in
Frankfurt in die Luft gesprengt hat. Jawohl, Herr General – – Name
Leutenant Dunbar. Sabotage. Jawohl, Herr General.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: There will be two S.S. men here
tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General
Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I’m sure you won’t
forget to give me the proper credit.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I want to sleep… I haven’t slept for three
days.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: You will remember the name? Von
Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Herein!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Der Mann vom Roten Kreuz moechte den Herrn
Oberst sprechen!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Ich bitte!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Well, Herr Inspector! How did you
find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar.
Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: What exactly is he charged with?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Whatever it is, it’s out of your
jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a
saboteur.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: He is a prisoner of war until you can
prove sabotage.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I didn’t do it. I was in the Frankfurt
station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Oh, come now! You threw a time
bomb.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: How could I have had a time bomb? They
searched me when they took me prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: And the way you search your prisoners,
it does sound rather unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: All I know is he did it. I am
satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: I am not. According to the Geneva
Convention –</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Is there anything about letting a guy sleep
in the Geneva Convention?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: You were saying –?</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Simply this. After the hostilities are
ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this
man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held
responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Very well. If you insist on details.
I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.
You will forgive me for receiving you like this?</p>
<p><strong>geneva man</strong>: Perfectly all right. I do not like
boots.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Schulz!</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Wie ist es moeglich dass dieser
Amerikaner eine Bombe bei sich hatte? Er wurde doch bei der
Gefangennahme untersucht.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.</p>
<p><strong>von scherbach</strong>: Finden Sie es heraus – und zwar
sofort!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Zu Befehl, Herr Kommandant.</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: I believe it. I believe it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Put it down, boys.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, – music!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We made a deal with Barrack One.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Any news on Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: He’s still in the Kommandant’s office. That’s
all I know.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Let’s have that distillery. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What are you looking at him for? Any
objections, Sefton?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Take it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Next we’re going to auction off your
department store – and your stable.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.</strong>: Hey! That goes with it!</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.s</strong>: Do Bogart. Do Cary Grant.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Do Cagney.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Naw! Do Grable!</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Grable, not Gable!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do Jimmy Durante!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: There was that ammunition train in the
depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men’s room and
fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out,
see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor,
see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later – voom! See?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Throws what? How could he have a time
bomb?</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Just pulled the old match gag, see!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’s the match gag?</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Take some matches, see? And a cigarette,
see? Tuck the cigarette in like this, see? Now the cigarette keeps
burning like a fuse, see?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Say, that’s a dandy!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yeah. Pretty clever.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Do Grable.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, here’s Esther Williams.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nothing, eh?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.</strong>: Do Cary Grant.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Where’s the corkscrew?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Have a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Hey, Joey – there’s a present for you.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Want me to open it for you?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: There, Joey – ain’t that better than being a
lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Animal! Got a little something for you!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Got a little something for you, too!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll open mine now.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I’ll open mine, too.</p>
<p><strong>harry and stosh</strong>: You’re a doll! Just what I wanted!
How did you know!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Air raid warning.</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Not Christmas Eve!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Come on, everybody. Let’s get out. Let’s hit
those slit trenches.</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: I’m not really built for war.</p>
<p><strong>schulz’ voice</strong>: Out, out everybody!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You must get out. For your own good, you
must get out.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Come on, everybody! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: What’s the matter with you? You want to be
killed?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Must you always be the last?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Oh, yeah? You jump in those trenches first
and everybody jumps on top of you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How do you think I got my hernia?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie’s
herausgefunden?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Ich weiss alles.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Wie hat er’s gemacht?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Ganz einfach… Streichhoelzer… und eine
Zigarette…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Passen Sie auf!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Ach so!… ACH SO!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Air raid! Air raid! Everybody in the
trenches!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Ach so-o-o-o!</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: So it got to be Christmas Day in
Stalag 17. As it turned out, it was more like the Fourth of July – with
all the fireworks that were to go off all at once and bust the camp wide
open. It sure started off innocently enough, with a party going on in
every barracks…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, Animal – let’s trip the light
fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Let me alone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re crying, Animal.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: It’s that song, Harry!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You don’t want to cry over a dame that
doesn’t even know you’re alive! Snap out of it!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: There’s a time in every man’s life when he
wants to be alone! So go away!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: All right, boys, who wants the Queen of the
May?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Any cigars left, Cookie?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Come on, Cookie. Get me a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What’s the matter? You on their team now?
You think I’m the guy?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: I don’t know anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I understand how you feel, Cookie. It’s sort
of rough – one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie
– maybe that stoolie’s not an American at all. Maybe he’s a German the
Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an
agent in with us – a trained specialist. Lots of loose information
floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to
escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and
how our radar operates. Could be, couldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: In this barracks?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our
bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up.
Except that he beat hardest.</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: That’s not the point, Cookie. The point is
what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out
of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or
you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole
barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: If you don’t want to tell me, why don’t you
tell Hoffy? Or Security?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Yeah. Security.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: Where’s Hoffy? Why don’t we get any news
about Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t worry. He’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>bagradian</strong>: I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off
my mouth!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Forget it. He’ll be back here. They’ve got no
proof.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sweet and soft, boys. Beguile me.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Betty!… Betty!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: May I have this dance, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why, sure!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Who would’ve ever thought I’d be holding you
in my arms?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Pinch me, will you? Pinch me so I’ll know I’m
not dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Thank you, darling!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Did anybody ever tell you you have the most
beautiful legs in the world?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: But it’s not just those legs. It’s that nose
of yours I’m crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, Animal! Animal!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: I’ve been crazy about you for years. I’ve
seen every picture you’ve ever made six times. I’d just sit there and
never even open that popcorn bag.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Animal! Animal! Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Betty! Betty!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is me, Animal! It’s Harry Shapiro!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Cut that music! Cut it! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar.
They’re taking him to Berlin. Looks like he’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Only he ain’t quite finished yet. Blondie –
get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve’s leg.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: I want everybody out of here. We’ll need a
lot of commotion on the compound.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: I’ll get the men from the other barracks.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You don’t think you can snatch Dunbar? Not
from the S.S.?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: We’re sure going to make a stab at it. You,
Price and Stosh and Harry and Blondie – be at the north latrine. You’ll
all get your posts. Now everybody start drifting out with Marko.</p>
<p><strong>marko</strong>: Easy, boys, easy. Disperse out there nicely
and always remember just because the Krauts are dumb that doesn’t make
them stupid.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Okay. Move on.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t know what your scheme is, but it
sounds crazy.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Maybe it’s crazy, but it’s better than having
Dunbar dead.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn’t it be
smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about Schulz. I’d worry
about Sefton. Remember me? I’m the stoolie.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You ain’t going to squeal this one,
brother.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: No? Aren’t you a little afraid to turn the
stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what
the Krauts would pay?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You’ll stay in this barracks and not a peep
out of you.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to
put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time
you won’t have a patsy. Right?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No – not
Joey. Wouldn’t you feel safer with Security on the job?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Okay, Price. You stay.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What about Schulz?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: We’ll take care of Schulz. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: That’s the boy, Joey. Play us a little
something. What do you want to hear, Price? Home On The Range? Or maybe
a little Wagner?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you’re
not a pinochle man. You’re a chess player. I haven’t played since I was
a kid. Let’s see – – a pawn moves this way, doesn’t it? And a bishop
this way? And the queen – every which way, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth
shut.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I went to school with a guy named Price. But
that was in Boston. You’re from Cleveland, aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yes, I’m from Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I thought that’s what you said. You’re from
Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Thirty-fifth.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron?
Out of Chelveston?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Are you questioning me?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one
friend in this barracks.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t bother, Sefton. I don’t like you. I
never did and I never will.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: A lot of people say that and the first thing
you know is they get married and live happily ever after. I wonder what
they’re trying to pull out there?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Ach so!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Amazing, what you can do with five thousand
ping-pong balls, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Stop that, will you! Those idiots! So they
sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He’s still in the compound, isn’t he?
How long can he last? Where can they hide him?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Where. Up Joey’s ocarina. Didn’t you
know?</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: Yeah? Where did we hide him? Nobody
knew that except Hoffy – not one of us – and he wouldn’t talk. It sure
drove the Krauts crazy looking for Dunbar. They herded us all out into
the compound and put some extra machine guns on us and gave us the old
picture check. You know, checking our dogtags and our pans…</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: …against their index file. They
searched under the barracks. They searched the roofs. They even searched
the bathroom in the Kommandant’s office, but no Dunbar. Then they tried
to smoke him out, throwing tear gas bombs into every barracks, just in
case he was hiding up in the rafters. Then they made us stand for six
hours out there until finally von Scherbach came out and gave us his
ultimatum: if Dunbar didn’t come out by next morning he’d raze the whole
lous; compound, stick by stick and if we’d sleep in the mud for the rest
of our lives, that was okay by him. I thought he’d bust his gut the way
he was screaming. He just couldn’t figure how a guy could disappear from
the compound and still be there, but Dunbar was there all right. He sure
was there.</p>
<p><strong>cookie’s voice</strong>: He was there for half the night, his
feet right in the icy water. That’s tough to take, especially when you
got three heated pools at home. It took a lot of guts, the kind you’d
expect from a sergeant – but a lieutenant –!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Let’s have it understood men – this is going
to be a rough deal. But we have no choice. One of us must take Dunbar
out of the camp tonight. Right away. We’ll draw one dogtag and the guy
who goes with it does the job. It’s going to be rough because the Krauts
have put on extra guards and they are expecting a move like this. So if
anyone wants to withdraw, he better speak up now.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Then we’re all in on it?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Everybody but Joey, and you know who.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Okay. Who’s the lucky one?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let me do it, Hoffy.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You want to go?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. I want to draw.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: All right. Draw.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Suppose we call this my tag. I’ll take him
out.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: No volunteers, Price. I said we’re all in on
it.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You have elected me Security. The way things
have been going in this Barracks, I guess I’ve done a poor job and I
want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: We’ve all done a poor job of it.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I still say this is my tag. Any objections,
Hoffy?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Any objections, men?</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: Not from me.</p>
<p><strong>triz</strong>: He can have it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who are we to argue with a hero?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How about me latching on, Price?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Three’s a crowd, especially if you’ve got to
cut your way through barbed wire. Here’s the wire cutters. Are the
civilian clothes ready?</p>
<p><strong>blondie</strong>: Coming up.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Get going on the trap door.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What do you say, Hoffy. We’ll hit the air
raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You’d better cut out in back of the south
latrine.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Why the south latrine?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Because that’s where he is. In the water
tank.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Good spot. With any luck we’ll make Krems by
morning, or maybe even catch a barge to Linz.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never
gets out of the compound.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You starting that again?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Anybody cover?</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Somebody step on that crumb!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We warned you, Sefton!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Sure you warned me. You were going to slit
the throat of that stoolie.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Here’s the knife to do it with. Only make
sure you got the right throat.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We’re looking at it.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Hurry up on that trap. What are you trying to
do, Sefton? Gum up the works?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: That’s right. Or would you rather see Dunbar
lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and
Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they
wouldn’t tear you apart –</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I called it the last time, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Are we going to stand around here and listen
to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: The Germans know where Dunbar is.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: How do they know?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You told them, Hoffy.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You did!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You off your rocker?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Uh-huh. Fell right on my head. Sprechen sie
deutsch?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No. I don’t sprechen sie deutsch.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you’re
kaput, Price.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can
go?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Go where? To the Kommandant’s office and
tell him where Dunbar is?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’ll kill you for that!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Shut up! Security Officer, eh? Screening
everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland,
Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price?
Or, don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: December seventh, forty-one.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What time?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Six o’clock. I was having dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Six o’clock in Berlin. They were having
lunch in Cleveland. Am I boring you, boys?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: He’s a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his
name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when
the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little
Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him
phony dogtags –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: He’s lying! He’s just trying to get himself
off the hook!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shut up, he said.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You heard him.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Okay, Herr Preismaier, let’s have the mail
box.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: The one you took out of the corner of your
bunk and put in this pocket.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Now let me show you how they did it. They
did it by mail. That’s right. Little love notes between our Security
Officer and von Scherbach with Schulz the mail man. Here’s the flag. And
here’s the mail box. Cute, isn’t it? They delivered the mail or picked
it up when we were out of the barracks, like for Appell. When there was
a special delivery, they’d pull a phony air raid to get us out of here,
like for instance, last night. There wasn’t a plane in the sky – or was
there, Price?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Hilfe!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Gag him.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Brother, were we all wet about you!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What are we going to do with him?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Don’t you know? Because I got my own ideas.
Let’s have that civilian stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I’ll look pretty stupid in this, yodelling
my way over those Alps. Now let’s have the wire cutters.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: You taking Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You betcha. There ought to be some reward
money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: I told you boys I’m no escape artist, but
for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What’s the decoy?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Price. When I go I want you to give me five
minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then
you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He’ll draw every
light from every goon tower. It’s our only chance to cut through. What
do you say, Barracks’ Chief?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Shoot!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What’s the matter, Price? You said you were
going to save Dunbar, didn’t you? So now, you’re getting your
chance.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: So long, Cookie. The department store is all
yours. What’s left of it.</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: So long, Sefton.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: You’re not disposing of those Russian
broads?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a
hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another
face.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You could use a new one yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Let’s synchronize the watches. Eleven
forty-two, sharp.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: One more word. If I ever run into any of you
bums on a street corner, just let’s pretend we never met before.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: This barracks will never be the same.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Shut off the moaning, or we’ll have the dogs
on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: My legs are frozen.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You’d better get that blue blood
circulating, because we’re busting out of this stink-hole in exactly – –
one minute and twenty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Sefton!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Not you.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: What some brandy?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Who doesn’t! Suppose we wait until we hit
the Waldorf Astoria.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: You won’t get off that cheap.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: What are the chances busting out of
here?</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: We’ll know in forty seconds. Only in a
democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hold his leg.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just in case your Kameraden are hard of
hearing.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Fifteen seconds. Get him up.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Stop shaking, Price. There’ll be no pardon
from no governor.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Funny, ain’t it? In your own Vaterland – by
your own Soldaten! The kid’s got no sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: What’s the matter with you, Security? You
were always so calm. Especially when you let Manfredi and Johnson go out
there. Open the hatch.</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: Let ’er go!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Schiesst nicht! Schiesst nicht! Ich bin ein
Deutscher!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>sefton</strong>: Let’s blow, Chauncey.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Let’s!</p>
<p><strong>hoffy</strong>: All right, men. Everybody back in their bunks
like nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What do you know? The crud did it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’d like to know what made him do it.</p>
<p><strong>stosh</strong>: Maybe he just wanted to steal our wire
cutters. Ever think of that?</p>
