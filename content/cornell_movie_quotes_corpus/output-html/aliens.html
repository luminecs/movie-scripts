<p><strong>first draft</strong>: May 28, 1985</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Internal pressure positive. Assume nominal
hull integrity. Hypersleep capsules, style circa late twenties…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Lights are green. She’s alive. Well, there
goes out salvage, guys.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Why don’t I open the viewport? Watch your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: And how are we today?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Terrible.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Just terrible? That’s better than
yesterday at least.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How long have I been on Gateway station?</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Just a couple of days. Do you feel up to a
visitor?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Jones!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Come here Jonesy you ugly old moose…you ugly
thing.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Nice room. I’m Burke. Carter Burke. I work for
the company, but other than that I’m an okay guy. Glad to see you’re
feeling better. I’m told the weakness and disorientation should pass
soon. Side effects of the unusually long hypersleep, or something like
that.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How long was I out there? They won’t tell me
anything.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Well, maybe you shouldn’t worry about that
just yet.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: All right. My instinct says you’re strong
enough to handle this…Fifty-seven years.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Fifty-seven…oh, Christ…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You’d drifted right through the core systems.
It’s blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they…are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Code Blue! 415. Code Blue! 4-1-5!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No…noooo!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hold her…Get me an airway, stat! And fifteen
cc’s of…Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Bad dreams again? Do you want something to
help you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No.. I’ve slept enough.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: We made it, Jones. We made it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Dumbshit.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Sorry…I’ve been running behind all
morning.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Have they located my daughter yet?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Well, I was going to wait until after the
inquest…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Is she…?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I
guess. Age: sixty-six …at time of death. Two years ago. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Amy.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven’t licked that
one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No
children.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I promised her I’d be home for her birthday.
Her eleventh birthday. I sure missed that one. Well…she has already
learned to take my promises with a grain of salt. When it came to flight
schedules, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You always think you can make it up to
somebody…later, you know. But now I never can. I never can.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: The hearing convenes at 0930. You don’t want
to be late.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You read my deposition…it’s complete and
accurate.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, I believe you, but there are going to
be some heavyweights in there. You got Feds, you got interstellar
commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company
guys…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I get the picture.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Just tell them what happened. The important
thing is to stay cool and unemotional.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Do you people have earwax, of what? We have
been here three hours. How many different ways do you want me to tell
the same story?</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: Look at it from our perspective. You
freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an
M-Class star-freighter. A rather expensive piece of hardware…</p>
<p><strong>insurance investigator</strong>: Forty-two million in
adjusted dollars. That’s minus payload, of course.</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: The shuttle’s flight recorder
corroborates some elements of your account. That the Nostromo set down
on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time. That repairs were made.
That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct.
By you. For reasons unknown.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Look, I told you…</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: It did not, however, contain any entries
concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Then somebody’s gotten to it… doctored the
recorder. Who had access to it?</p>
<p><strong>eca rep</strong>: Would you just listen to yourself for one
minute.</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: The analysis team which went over your
shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the
creature you describe…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That’s because I blew it out the Goddamn
airlock! Like I said.</p>
<p><strong>insurance man</strong>: Are there any species like this
‘hostile organism’ on LV-426?</p>
<p><strong>eca rep</strong>: No. It’s a rock. No indigenous life larger
than a simple virus.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I told you, it wasn’t indigenous. There was
an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship. We homed on its beacon…</p>
<p><strong>eca rep</strong>: To be perfectly frank, we’ve surveyed over
three hundred worlds and no one’s ever reported a creature which, using
your words… …‘gestates in a living human host’ and has ‘concentrated
molecular acid for blood.’</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Look, I can see where this is going. But I’m
telling you those things exist. Back on that planetoid is an alien ship
and on that ship are thousands of eggs. Thousands. Do you understand? I
suggest you find it, using the flight recorder’s data. Find it and deal
with it – before one of your survey teams comes back with a little
surprise…</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will
be…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: …because just one of those things managed to
kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching…</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: Thank you, that will be all.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That’s not all, Goddamnit! If those things
get back here, that will be all. Then you can just kiss it good-bye,
Jack! Just kiss it goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You had them eating out of your hand,
kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They had their minds made up before I even
went in there. They think I’m a head case.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You are a head case. Have a donut.</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: It is the finding of this board of
inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley, NOC-14672. has acted with
questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a
commercial flight officer.</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: Said license is hereby suspended
indefinitely. No criminal charges will be filed at this time and you are
released on own recognizance for a six month period of psychometric
probation, to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric tech…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Why won’t you check out LV-426?</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: Because I don’t have to. The people who
live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and ‘hostile
organism’ or alien ship. And by the way, they call it Acheron now.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What are you talking about. What people?</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: Terraformers…planet engineers. It’s what
we call a shake ‘n’ bake colony. They set up atmosphere processors to
make the air breathable…big job. Takes decades. They’ve already been
there over twenty years. Peacefully.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How many colonists?</p>
<p><strong>van leuwen</strong>: Sixty, maybe seventy families.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Sweet Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>elevator passenger</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: You remember you sent some wildcatters out
to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Yeah. What?</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: There’s a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop
survey team. Says he’s homing on something and wants to know if his
claim will be honored.</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Christ. Some honch in a cushy office on
Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we
look. They don’t say why, and I don’t ask. I don’t ask because it takes
two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer’s always ‘don’t
ask.’</p>
<p><strong>lydecker</strong>: So what do I tell this guy?</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Tell him, as far as I’m concerned, he finds
something it’s his.</p>
<p><strong>jorden</strong>: Look at this fat, juicy magnetic profile.
And it’s mine, mine, mine.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Half mine, dear.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: And half mine!</p>
<p><strong>jorden</strong>: I got too many partners.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Daddy, when are we going back to town?</p>
<p><strong>jorden</strong>: When we get rich, Newt.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: You always say that. I wanna go back. I wanna
play ‘Monster Maze.’</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You cheat too much.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Do not. I’m just the best.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Do too! You go in places we can’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: So! That’s why I’m the best.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Knock it off! I catch either of you playing in
the air ducts again I’ll tan your hides.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Mom. All the kids play it…</p>
<p><strong>jorden</strong>: Holy shiiit!</p>
<p><strong>jorden</strong>: Folks, we have scored big this time.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You kids stay inside. I mean it! We’ll be
right back.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Shouldn’t we call in?</p>
<p><strong>jorden</strong>: Let’s wait till we know what to call it in
as.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: How about ‘big weird thing’?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Cheater!</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Timmy…they’ve been gone a long time.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: It’ll be okay, Newt. Dad knows what he’s
doing.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four
Niner calling Hadley Control. Repeat. This is…</p>
<p><strong>voice from video</strong>: Hey, Bob! I heard you and the
family are heading off for the colonies!</p>
<p><strong>bon</strong>: Best decision I ever made, Bill. We’ll be
starting a new life from scratch, in a clean world. No crime. No
unemployment…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman of
the…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Ripley we have to talk. They’ve lost contact
with the colony on Acheron.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No. There’s no way!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hear me out…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you
guys…and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, we don’t know what’s going on out
there. It may just be a down transmitter. But if it’s not, I want you
there…as an advisor. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: You wouldn’t be going in with the troops. I
can guarantee your safety.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: These Colonial Marines are some tough
hombres, and they’re packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they
can’t handle…right, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: We’re trained to deal with these kinds of
situations.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What about you? What’s your interest in
this?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Well, the corporation co-financed that colony
with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights. We’re getting
into a lot of terraforming…‘Building Better Worlds.’</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I heard you were working in the cargo
docks.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of
thing?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s all I could get. Anyway, it keeps my
mind off of… everything. Days off are worse.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: What if I said I could get you reinstated as
a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your
contract?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: If I go.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: If you go. It’s a second chance, kiddo. And
it’ll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat
it. You gotta get back on the horse…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Spare me, Burke. I’ve had my psych
evaluation this month.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yes, and I’ve read it. You wake up every
night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No! The answer is no. Now please go. I’m
sorry. Just go, would you.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Burke, just tell me one thing. That you’re
going out there to kill them. Not study. Not bring back. Just burn them
out…clean …forever.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: That’s the plan. My word on it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: All right. I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: And you my dear, are staying right here.</p>
<p><strong>spunkmeyer</strong>: Arrgh. I’m getting too old for this
shit.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: They ain’t payin’ us enough for this.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Not enough to have to wake up to your
face, Drake.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Suck air. Hey, Hicks…you look like I
feel.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: This floor’s freezing.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Christ. I never saw such a buncha old women.
You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Would you, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Hey, Vasquez…you ever been mistaken for a
man?</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: No. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Hey, hand job, you take my towel?</p>
<p><strong>spunkmeyer</strong>: I need some slack, man. How come they
send us straight back out like this? We got some slack comin’, man.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: You just got three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>spunkmeyer</strong>: I mean breathing, not this frozen
shit.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Yeah, ‘Top’…what about it?</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: You know it ain’t up to me. Awright! Let’s
knock off the grabass. First assembly’s in fifteen…let’s shag it.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Who’s the fresh meat again?</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: She’s supposed to be some kinda consultant…
…She was an alien once.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Whoooah! No shit? I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Let’s go…let’s go. Cycle through!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Hey, ‘Top.’ What’s the op?</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Rescue mission. There’s some juicy colonists’
daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.</p>
<p><strong>spunkmeyer</strong>: Shee-it. Dumbass colonists. What’s this
crap supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: Cornbread, I think. Hey, I wouldn’t
mind getting me some more a that Arcturan poontang. Remember that
time?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Looks like that new Lieutenant’s too good to
eat with us grunts.</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: Yeah. Got a corn cob up his ass,
definitely.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry you feel that way about
Synthetics, Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You never said anything about an android
being here! Why not?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Well, it didn’t occur to me. It’s been policy
for years to have a synthetic on board.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I prefer the term ‘artificial person’
myself. Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: A synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip
out. Some deaths were involved.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m shocked. Was it an older model?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Well, that explains it. The A/2’s were
always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral
inhibitors. Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow
to be harmed a human being. More cornbread?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that
straight?</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: She don’t like the cornbread
either.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Tench-hut!</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: At ease. I’m sorry we didn’t have time to
brief before we left Gateway but…</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Yes, Hicks?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Hudson, Sir. He’s Hicks.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: What’s the question?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir,
on another bug-hunt?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: All we know is that there’s still no contact
with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: It’s a bug-hunt. So what are these
things?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I’ve dictated what I know on these.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Tease us a bit.</p>
<p><strong>spunkmeyer</strong>: Yeah…previews.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Okay. It’s important to understand this
organism’s life cycle. It’s actually two creatures. The first form
hatches from a spore…a sort of large egg, and attaches itself to its
victim. Then it injects an embryo, detaches and dies. It’s essentially a
walking sex organ. The –</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Sounds like you, Hicks.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: The embryo, the second form, hosts in the
victim’s body for several hours. Gestating. Then it… …then it…emerges.
Moults. Grows rapidly –</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: I only need to know one thing.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Where they are.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Yo! Vasquez. Kick ass!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Anytime. Anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Somebody said alien…she thought they said
illegal alien and signed up.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Anytime. Anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Am I disturbing you conversation
Mr. Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I hope you’re right. I really do.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been
kind enough to prepare for you.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Are there any questions? Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: How do I get out of this chicken-shit
outfit?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: All right. I want this to go smooth and by
the numbers. I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830.
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have
seven hours…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Attention. This concluded final maneuvering
operations. Thank you for your cooperation. You may resume work.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Still nothing from the colony?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Dead on all channels.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Clear, please.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I feel like a fifth wheel here. Is there
anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: I don’t know. Is there anything you can
do?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I can drive that loader. I’ve got a Class
Two rating. My latest career move.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Where you want it?</p>
<p><strong>web belts. packs. harnesses. helmets. com-sets.</strong>:
Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings. It has its own
rhythm…CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Let’s move it, girls! On the ready line.
Let’s go, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: I am ready, man. Ready to get it on.
Check-it-out. I am the ultimate badass…state of the badass art. You do
not want to fuck with me. Hey, Ripley, don’t worry. Me and my squad of
ultimate badasses will protect you. Check-it-out…</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Independently targetting particle-beam
phalanx. VWAP! Fry half a city with this puppy. We got tactical
smart-missles, phased-plasma pulse-rifles, RPG’s. We got sonic
eeelectronic ballbreakers, we got nukes, we got knives…sharp sticks
–</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Save it.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Sure, Hicks.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Initiate release sequencer on my mark. Three.
Two. One. Mark!</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Switching to DCS ranging.</p>
<p><strong>spunkmeyer</strong>: Two-four-o. Nominal to profile. Picking
up some hull ionization.</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Got it. Rough air ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Stand by for some chop.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How may drops is this for you,
Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Thirty-eight…simulated.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: How many combat drops?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Well…two. Three, including this one.</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Turning on final. Coming around to a
seven-zero-niner. Terminal guidance locked in. Where’s the damn
beacon?</p>
<p><strong>bio-monitors</strong>: EEG, EKG, and other graphic
life-function readouts. Other screens show EXTERIOR VIEWS.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Let’s see. Everybody on line. Drake, check
you camera. There seems to be a…</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: …that’s better. Pan it around a bit.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Awright. Fire-team A. Gear up. Let’s move.
Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That the atmosphere processor?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the
planet. They’re completely automated. We manufacture them, by the
way.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Hold at forty. Slow circle of the
complex.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: The structure seems intact. They have
power.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Okay, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Awright! I want a nice clean dispersal this
time.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: You staying in here?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Figures.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Set down sixty meters this side of the
telemetry mast. Immediate dust off on my ‘clear,’ then stay on
station.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: First squad up, on line. Hicks, get yours in
a cordon. Watch the rear.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Vasquez, take point. Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Sealed. Hudson, run a bypass.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: First squad, assemble on me at the main
lock.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Second team, move up. Flanking
positions.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Quarter and search by twos. Second team move
inside. Hicks, take the upper level. Use your motion trackers.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Nothing. No movement.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Looks like my room in college.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Wait! Tell him to… …Hicks. Back up. Pan
left. There!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: You seeing this okay? Looks melted.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hmm. Acid for blood.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Looks like somebody bagged them one of
Ripley’s bad guys here.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Hey, if you like that, you’re gonna love
this…</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Second squad? What’s your status?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Just finished our sweep. Nobody home.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: The place is dead, Sir. Whatever happened, we
missed it.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: All right, the area’s secured. Let’s go in
and see what their computer can tell us. First team head for operations.
Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line. Hicks, meet me at the
south lock by the up-link tower…</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: …We’re coming in.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: He’s coming in. I feel safer already.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Pendejo jerkoff.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Sir, the CPU is on-line.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Okay, stand by in operations. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Burke!</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: Scare you?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Christ, Wierzbowski!</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: Sorry. Hicks said to keep an eye on
you.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Looks like you company can write off its
share of this colony.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’s insured.</p>
<p><strong>front</strong>: Sir, you should check this out…</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Right ahead here…</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: Last stand.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: No bodies?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: No, Sir. Looks like it was a helluva
fight.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Are these the same…?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Watch it, Burke…</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: It likes you.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: These are dead. There’s just the two
alive.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Removed surgically before embryo
implantation. Subject: Marachuk, John L. Died during procedure. They
killed him getting it off.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Behind us.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: One of us?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Apone…where are your people? Anybody in
D-Block?</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Negative. We’re all in Operations.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: It’s moving.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: You fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Come on out. It’s all right…</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Ow! Shit. Watchit, she bites.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s over… you’re
going to be all right now… it’s okay…you’re safe…</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: What’s her name again?</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate. Just start
at the beginning…</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Where are your parents? You have to try…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Gorman! Give it a rest would you.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Total brain-lock.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Physically she’s okay. Borderline
malnutrition, but I don’t think any permanent damage.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Come on, we’re wasting our time.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Here, try this. A little instant hot
chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Poor thing. You don’t talk much do you?
That’s okay by me. Most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not
saying very much.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Uh oh. I made a clean spot here. Now I’ve
done it. Guess I’ll just have to do the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hard to believe…there’s a little girl under
all this. And a pretty one at that.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: What’s he scanning for?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: PDT’S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every
adult colonist had one surgically implanted.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: If they’re within twenty klicks we’ll read
it out here, but so far…zip.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I don’t know how you managed to stay alive
but you’re one brave kid, Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: N-newt.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Newt. My n-name’s Newt. Nobody calls me
Rebecca except my dork brother.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Well, Newt it is then. My name’s Ripley…and
people call me Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Pleased to meet you. And who is this? Does
she have a name?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Casey. She’s my only friend.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: I don’t want you for a friend.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Because you’ll be gone soon, like the others.
Like everybody. You’ll be dead and you’ll leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Oh, Newt. You mom and dad went away like
that, didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’d be here if they could, honey. I know
they would.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: They’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt. Look at me…Newt. I won’t leave you. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: You promise?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Cross my heart.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: And hope to die?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: And hope to die.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Hah! Stop your grinnin’ and drop your linen!
Found ’em.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Alive?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Unknown. But, it looks like all of them.
Over at the processing station…sublevel ‘C’ under the south tower.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Looks like a Goddamn town meeting.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Let’s saddle up.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Awright, let’s go girls, they ain’t payin’ us
by the hour.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: I was the best at the game. I knew the whole
maze.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: The ‘maze’? You mean the air ducts?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor.
I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You’re really something, ace.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Forty meters in. Ramp on axial two-two.
Access to sublevels.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: B-Level. Next one down.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: We’re not making that out too well. What is
it?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: You tell me. I only work here.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Proceed inside.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Looks like some sort of secreted
resin.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: They ripped apart the colony for building
materials.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: And the colonists…When they were done with
them. Newt, you better go sit up front. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Hotter’n hell in here.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Yeah…but it’s a dry heat.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’re right under the primary heat
exchangers.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat,
that’s why they built…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That’s not what I mean. Gorman, if your men
have to use their weapons in there, they’ll rupture the cooling
system.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: She’s right.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: So…then the fusion containment shuts
down.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: So? So?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: We’re talking thermonuclear explosion.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Shit. Apone, collect magazines from
everybody. We can’t have any firing in there.</p>
<p><strong>wierzbowski</strong>: Is he fucking crazy?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: What’re we supposed to use, man? Harsh
language?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Flame-units only. I want rifles slung.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Let’s go. Pull ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: I always keep this handy. For close
encounter.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Let’s move. Hicks, back us up.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Any movement?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Nothing. Zip.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Please…God…kill me.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Flame thrower! Move!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Movement!</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Position?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Can’t lock up…</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Talk to me, Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Uh, seems to be in front and behind.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: We can’t see anything back here, Apone.
What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Pull you team out, Gorman.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Go to infrared. Looks sharp people!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Multiple signals. All round. Closing.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Let’s rock.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Who’s firing? I ordered a hold fire,
dammit!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Let’s get the fuck out of here!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Not that tunnel, the other one!</p>
<p><strong>crowe</strong>: You sure? Watch it…behind you. Fucking move,
will you!</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Shut up. Just shut up!</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Uh,…Apone, I want you to lay down a
suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the
APC, over.</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Say again? All after incinerators?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: I said…</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: …lay down …by squads to…</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Dietrich? Crowe? Sound off! Wierzbowski?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: We’re getting juked! We’re gonna die in
here!</p>
<p><strong>apone</strong>: Yeah. Right. Right! Fuck the heat
exchanger!</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: I told them to fall back…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’re but off! Do something!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt, put your seatbelt on!</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Ripley, what the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: What are you doing? Turn around! That’s an
order!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Drake! He’s down!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: He’s gone! Forget it, he’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: No.. No, he’s not. He’s –</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Get on the Goddamn door!</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. apc 104-</strong>: 105</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: It’s okay…we’re clear. We’re clear. Ease
up.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Sounds like a blown transaxle. You’re just
grinding metal.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt? Where’s Newt?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Jesus…Jesus…I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: I’m all right, leave it!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: He’s alive. I think he’s paralyzed.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: He’s fucking dead!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Wake up pendejo! I’m gonna kill you, you
useless fuck!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Hold it. Hold it. Back off, right now.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Looks like it stung him.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Hey…hey! Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren’t
dead, man.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: They must be like Gorman. Their signs are
real low but they ain’t dead!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You can’t help them. Right now they’re being
cocooned just like the others.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Oh, God. Jesus. This ain’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>spunkmeyer</strong>: Need anything else?</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: All right, we can’t blow the fuck out of
them…why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the
whole nest?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Look, man, let’s just bug out and call it
even, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No good. How do we know it’ll effect their
biochemistry? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.
It’s the only way to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now hold on a second. I’m not authorizing
that action.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Well, I mean…I know this is an emotional
moment, but let’s not make snap judgments. Let’s move cautiously. First,
this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
–</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They can bill me. I got a tab running.
What’s second?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: This is clearly an important species we’re
dealing with here. We can’t just arbitrarily exterminate them –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Maybe you haven’t been keeping up on current
events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Look, Burke. We had an agreement.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I know, I know, but we’re dealing with
changing scenarios here. This thing is major, Ripley. I mean really
major. You gotta go with its energy. Since you are the representative of
the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally
be some serious, serious money.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Don’t make me pull rank, Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has
authority here.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Corporal Hicks!?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: This operation is under military
jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, this is a multimillion dollar
operation. He can’t make that kind of decision. He’s just a grunt! No
offense.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: None taken. Ferro, you copying?</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Standing by.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Prep for dust-off. We’re gonna need an
immediate evac. I think we’ll take off and nuke the site from orbit.
It’s the only way to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: This is absurd! You don’t have the authority
to –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: We’re going home, honey.</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Spunkmeyer? Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>ferro</strong>: Where the fu –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Well that’s great! That’s just fucking
great, man. Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We’re in some
real pretty shit now!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Are you finished? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: I guess we’re not leaving, right?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I’m sorry, Newt.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: You don’t have to be sorry. It wasn’t your
fault.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Just tell me what the fuck we’re supposed to
do now. What’re we gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: May be could build a fire and sing songs.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: We should get back, ’cause it’ll be dark soon.
They come mostly at night. Mostly.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: This is all we could salvage. We’ve got four
pulse-rifles with about fifty rounds each. Not so good. About fifteen
M-40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full…one damaged.
And We’ve got four of these robot-sentry units with scanners and display
intact.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How long after we’re declared overdue can we
expect a rescue?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: About seventeen days.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Man, we’re not going to make it seventeen
hours! Those things are going to come in here, just like they did
before, man… they’re going to come in here and get us, man, long
before…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: She survived longer than that with no
weapons and no training.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: So you better just start dealing with it.
Just deal with it, Hudson…because we need you and I’m tired of your
bullshit. Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan
file. Construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that
shows the layout of this place. I want to see air ducts, electrical
access tunnels, subbasements. Every possible way into this wing.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Aye-firmative. I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’ll be in medical. I’d like to continue my
analysis.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Fine. You do that.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: This service tunnel is how they’re moving
back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Yeah, right, it runs from the processing
station right into the sublevel here.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: All right. There’s a fire door at this end.
The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that
door.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We gotta figure on them getting into the
complex.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That’s right. So we put up welded barricades
at these intersections… …and seal these ducts here and here. Then they
can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field
of fire for the other two sentry units, here.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Outstanding. Then all we need’s a deck of
cards. All right, let’s move like we got a purpose.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Aye-firmative.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Aye-firmative!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Testing!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Hudson here. A and B sentries are in place
and keyed. We’re sealing the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Here, put this on. Then I can locate you
anywhere in the complex on this –</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Just a…precaution. You know.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Uh, what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Now you just lie here and have a nap. You’re
exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: I don’t want to…I have scary dreams.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I’ll bet Casey doesn’t have bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Nothing bad in here. Maybe you could just
try to be like her.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Ripley…she doesn’t have bad dreams because
she’s just a piece of plastic.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Oh. Sorry, Newt.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: My mommy always said there were no monsters.
No real ones. But there are.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yes, there are, aren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Why do they tell little kids that?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Well, some kids can’t handle it like you
can.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Did one of those things grow inside her?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I don’t know, Newt. That’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Isn’t that how babies come? I mean people
babies…they grow inside you?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No, it’s different, honey.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Did you ever have a baby?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yes. A little girl.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: You mean dead.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Ripley, I was just thinking… Maybe I could do
you a favor and fill in for her. Just for a while. You can try it and if
you don’t like it, it’s okay. I’ll understand. No big deal. Whattya
think?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I think it’s not the worst idea I’ve heard
all day. Let’s talk about it later.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Don’t go! Please.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I’ll be right in the other room, Newt. And
look…I can see you on that camera right up there.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Here. Take is for luck. Now go to sleep…and
don’t dream.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’ve isolated a neuro-muscular toxin
responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should
wake up soon.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Now let me get this straight. The aliens
paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be
hosts for more of those…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Which would mean lots of those parasites,
right? One for each person…over a hundred at least.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes. That follows.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: But these things come from eggs…so where are
all the eggs coming from.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That is the question of the hour. We could
assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike
organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a
single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You’re saying one of those things lays all
the eggs?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Well, the queen is always physically larger
then the others. A termite queen’s abdomen is so bloated with eggs that
it can’t move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by
the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the
mother of their society.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Could it be intelligent?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Hard to say. It may have been blind
instinct…attraction to the heat of whatever…but she did choose to
incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn’t destroy her without
destroying ourselves. That’s if she exists, of course.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I want those specimens destroyed as soon as
you’re done with them. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Mr. Burke have instructions that they were
to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs. He was very
specific.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Burke!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Those specimens are worth millions to the
bio-weapons division. Now, if you’re smart we can both come out of this
heroes. Set up for life.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You just try getting a dangerous organism
past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You’ve been doing your homework. Look, they
can’t impound it if they don’t know about it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: But they will know about it, Burke. From me.
Just like they’ll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one
hundred and fifty-seven colonists here –</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now, wait a second –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You sent them to that ship. I just checked
the colony log… directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke,
Carter J.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You sent them out there and you didn’t even
warn them, Burke. Why didn’t you warn them?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, maybe the thing didn’t even exist,
right? And if I’d made it a major security situation, the Administration
would’ve stepped in. Then no exclusive rights, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It was a bad call, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Bad call? These people are fucking dead,
Burke! Well, they’re going to nail your hide to the shed… and I’ll be
there when they do.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you
would be smarter than this.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: They’re coming. They’re in the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Guns A and B. Tracking and firing on multiple
targets.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: They must be wall to wall in there. Look at
those ammo counters go. It’s a shooting gallery down there.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: B gun’s dry. Twenty on A. Ten. Five. That’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’re at the fire door.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Man, listen to that.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Bishop here. I’m afraid I have some bad
news.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Well, that’s a switch.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That’s it. See it? Emergency venting.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How long until it blows?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m projecting total systems failure in a
little under four hours. The blast radius will be about thirty
kilometers. About equal to ten megatons.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We got problems.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: I don’t fucking believe this. Do you believe
this?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: And it’s too late to shut it down?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m afraid so. The crash did too much
damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Oh, man. And I was gettin’ short, too! Four
more weeks and out. Now I’m gonna buy it on this fuckin’ rock. It ain’t
half fair, man!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Hudson, give us a break.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: We need the other drop-ship. The on one the
Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: How? The transmitter was on the APC. It’s
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I don’t care how! Think of a way. Think of
something.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Think of what? We’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What about the colony transmitter? That
up-link tower down at the other end. Why can’t we use that?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I checked. The hard wiring between here and
there was severed in the fighting.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Well then somebody’s just going to have to
go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in
manually.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Oh, right! Right! With those things running
around. No way.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m really the only one qualified to
remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I’d prefer not to. I may be
synthetic but I’m not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: All right. Let’s get on it. What’ll you
need?</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Listen. It’s stopped.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Well, they’re into the complex.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: This duct runs almost to the up-link
assembly. One hundred eighty meters. Say, forty minutes to crawl down
there. One hour to patch in and align the antenna. Thirty minutes to
prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s going to be closer. You better get
going.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: See you soon.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: They’re in the approach corridor.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: On my way.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Twenty meters and closing. Fifteen. C and D
guns down about fifty percent.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Now many?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Can’t tell. Lots. D gun’s down to twenty.
Ten. It’s out.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They retreated. The guns stopped them.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Yeah. But look…</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Newt time then can walk right up and
knock.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: But they don’t know that. They’re probably
looking for other ways to get in. That’ll take them awhile.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Maybe we got ’em demoralized.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: I want you two walking the perimeter. I know
we’re all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We’ve got to
stop any entries before they get out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: How long since you slept? Twenty-four
hours?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’ll get us.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hicks, I’m not going to wind up like those
others. You’ll take care of it won’t you, it if comes to that?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: If it comes to that, I’ll do us both. Let’s
see that it doesn’t Here, I’d like to introduce you to a close personal
friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and under with a
30mm pump-action grenade launcher.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Just pull it in real right. It will kick
some. When the counter here heads zero, hit this…</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Just let it drop right out. Get the other one
in quick. Just slap it in hard, it likes abuse. Now, pull the bolt.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: You’re ready again.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Well, that’s the grenade launcher …you
probably don’t want to mess with that.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Look, you started this. Now show me
everything. I can handle myself.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Yeah. I’ve noticed.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.
Look, Ripley…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: You still want to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: It won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: There, there. Sssshh. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Now, if I did it right…</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Attention. Attention. Automatic
fueling operations have begun. Please extinguish all smoking
materials.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt. Newt, wake up.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Wah…? Where are…?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Sssh. Don’t move. We’re in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hey…hey!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hicks! Hicks!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Roger. Check back when you’ve activated the
ship. He’s at the up-link tower.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Mommy…mommmyyyyy…</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Mommy…I mean, Ripley…I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I know, honey. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in medical! We got a
fire!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: The corner! Ready?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Burke…it was Burke.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch
right now!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: I don’t get it. It doesn’t make any Goddamn
sense.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: He wanted an alien, only he couldn’t get it
back through quarantine. But if we were impregnated …whatever you call
it…and then frozen for the trip back at just the right time…then nobody
would know about the embryos we were carrying. We and Newt.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Wait a minute. We’d know about it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: The only way it would work is if he
sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back. Then he could jettison the
bodies and make up any story he liked.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Fuuuck! He’s dead. You’re dogmeat, pal.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: This is total paranoid delusion. It’s
pitiful.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You know, Burke, I don’t know which species
is worse. You don’t see them screwing each other over for a fucking
percentage.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Let’s waste him. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Just find someplace to lock him up until
it’s time to –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They cut the power.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: What do you mean, they cut the power? How
could they cut the power, man? They’re animals.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt! Stay close. Let’s get some trackers
going. Come on, get moving. Gorman, watch Burke.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: There’s something.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: It’s inside the complex.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: You’re just reading me.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: No. No! It ain’t you. They’re inside. Inside
the perimeter. They’re in here.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Hudson may be right.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: It’s game time.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Get back here, both of you. Fall back to
Operations.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: This signal’s weird…must be some
interference or something. There’s movement all over the place…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Just get back here!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Movement! Signal’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Range twenty meters.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Seal the door.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Seventeen meters.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Let’s get these things lit.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They learned. They cut the power and avoided
the guns. They must have found another way in, something we missed.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We didn’t miss anything.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Fifteen meters.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I don’t know, an acid hole in a duct.
Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking
signal. Ten meters.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’re right on us. Vasquez, how you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Nine meters. Eight.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Can’t be. That’s inside the room!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: It’s readin’ right. Look!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Well you’re not reading it right!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Six meters. Five. What the fu –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Medical! Get to medical!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Burke! Open the door!</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Let’s go! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Fuckin’ A!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Hold you fire!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Locked.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: You can’t use those in here!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Right. Fire in the hole!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Thanks a lot! Now I can’t hear shit.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Come on! This way.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Stay behind me.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Come on. Crawl faster.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: DO you know how to get to the landing field
from here?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Sure. Go left.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Go right.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Bishop, you read me? Come in, over.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes, I read you. Not very well…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: The ship is on its way. ETA about sixteen
minutes. I’ve got my hands full flying… the weather’s come up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: All right, stand by there. We’re on out way.
Over.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Back. Go back!</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Losing fuel.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: You always were an asshole, Gorman.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: This way. Come on, we’re almost there!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt, wait!</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Here! Go up.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Just up there –</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Riiiiipppleee –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt!</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Mommy…where are you?</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Moooommeeee…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hicks, get down here. I need that
locator.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt! Star wherever you are!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: This way. We’re close…</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Here! I’m here. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Climb down, honey. We have to cut through
this grate.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt! Newt!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No! Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: She’s gone! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No! No! She’s alive! We have to –</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: All right! She’s alive. I believe it. But we
gotta get moving! Now!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Come on, you can make it. Almost there.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Ripley…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: She’s alive. They brought her here and you
know it.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: In seventeen minutes this place will be a
cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hicks, don’t let him leave.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We ain’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: See you, Hicks.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Dwayne. It’s Dwayne.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Don’t be long, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Attention. Emergency. All personnel must
evacuate immediately. You now have fourteen minutes to reach minimum
safe distance.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Ripley…help me. I can feel it…inside. Oh,
God…it’s moving! Oh gooood…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You now have eleven minutes to reach minimum
safe distance.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: I knew you’d come.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on
tight.</p>
<p><strong>int. catacombs - corridor 178-</strong>: 179</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You now have two minutes to reach minimum
safe distance.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor - elevators 182-</strong>: 183</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Close your eyes, baby.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You now have thirty seconds to reach…</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. drop-ship - station 186-</strong>: 187</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Punch it, Bishop!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s okay, baby. We made it. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I gave him a shot, for the pain. We’ll need
to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry if I gave you a scare but that
platform was just becoming too unstable…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I had to circle and hope things didn’t get
too rough to take you off.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You did okay, Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Well, thanks, I –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Get away from her, you bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Not bad for a human.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Mommy…Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Right here, baby. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Are we going to sleep now?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>newt</strong>: Can we dream?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yes, honey. I think we both can.</p>
