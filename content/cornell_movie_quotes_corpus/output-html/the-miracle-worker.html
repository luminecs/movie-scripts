<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Shet11 live. KATE closes her eyes. I can
tell you now, I thought she wouldn’t,</p>
<p>****: I’ve brought up two of them, but this is my wife’s first, she
isn’t battle-scarred yet.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Doctor. Will my girl be all right?</p>
<p><strong>0 doctor</strong>: Oh, by morning she’ll be knocking down
Captain Kellerfs fences again.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Is there nothing we should do?</p>
<p>****: Put up stronger fencing, ha?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Just let her get well, she knows how to do
it better than we do. These things come and go in infants, never know
why. Call it acute congestion of the stomach and brain. KELL ? moves
after the DOCTOR, we hear them off-camera; we see only KATE’S face
hovering over us, her hand adjust- ing the blanket.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: I’ll see you to your buggy, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: 0 Main thing is the fever’s gone. I’ve never
seen a baby, more vitality, that’s the truth – Their voices and
footsteps fade. KATE is bent lovingly over the crib, which emits a
bleat; her finger is play- ful with the baby’s face.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hush. Don’t you cry now, you’ve been trouble
enough. Call it acute congestion, indeed, I don’t see what’s so cute
about a con- gestion, just because it’s yours? We’ll have your father
run an editorial in his paper, the wonders of modern medicine, they
don’t know what they’re curing even when they cure it. Men, men and
their battle scars, we women will have to – Helen, Helen Captain,
Captain, will you come.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Katie, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: KATE She can’t see. Look at her eyes. She takes
the lamp from him, moves it before the child’s face. She can’t seel</p>
<p>****: Helen.</p>
<p><strong>a k te</strong>: Or hear. When I screamed she didn’t blink.
Not an eyelash –</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Helen. Heleni</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: She can’t hear youl</p>
<p><strong>helenl</strong>: His face has something like fury in it,
crying the child’s name; KATE almost fainting presses her knuckles to
her mouth, to stop her own cry.</p>
<p><strong>6. continued</strong>: maze, the sheets blowing in the wind;
and staggering among them is the figure of the child, HELEN 5 years old,
reach- ing out, struggling, buffeted by the damp, blowing sheets, CRANE
DOWN towards the figure. HELEN lashes out, her face frightened,
unknowing — she pulls down a sheet, be- comes tangled in its folds,
almost hysterical. In the BG KATE comes rushing from the house – to help
her.</p>
<p><strong>10. continued</strong>: smiles. She is flanked by the other
two, in a litter of 0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, HELEN’S
hands thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the movements
of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the dialogue is only
background.</p>
<p>****: First Itm gonna cut off this doe- torts leg, one, two, now then
–</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Why you cuttin’ off that doctor’s legs?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’m gonna give him a operation. Now I’m
gonna cut off his arms, one, two. Now I’m gonna fix up She pushes
HELEN’S hand away from her mouth. You stop that.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Cut off his stomach, that’s a good
operation.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No, I’m gonna cut off his head first, he got
a bad cold.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Ain’t gonna be much of that doc- tor left to
fix up, time you finish all them opera– But HELEN is poking her fingers
inside his mouth, to feel his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she
jerks them away. HELEN now fingers her own lips, moving them in
imitation, but soundlessly. Again the CAMERA on this.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What you do, bite hand?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: That’s how I do, she keep pokint. her fingers
in my mouth, I just bite ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>:1artea</strong>: -.That she tryin’ do now?</p>
<p><strong>peercy</strong>: She tryint talk. She gonna get read. Looka
her try in’ talk.. ILLEN is scowling, the lips under her fingertips
moving in silence, growing more and more frantic, until in a bizarre
rage she bites at her own fingers. This sends PERCY off into laughter,
but alarms :MARTHA.</p>
<p><strong>marti</strong>: Hey, you stop now. She pulls EELEI’ S hand
down, You just sit quiet and But at once HELEIT topples LTARTHA on her
back, knees pinning her shoulders down, and ;-ravs the sissors. MARTHA
screams, hile her tied b _nchlets of hair f17 off in snips of the
scissors. PERCY darts to the bell stria on the porch, yanks it W THE
DELL</p>
<p><strong>ripgs.</strong>: bOA. DAY. INT. LIVID ROOLI</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: CAPTAIN X LLER is at work at his deal. JA ES is
at his ease in conversation with KATE and AUNT EV. KATE is serving a
cool refreshment. ITAR RINGING OF BELL. KATE rushes out the door
followed more slowly by A”MITT W, leaving behind JAILS &amp; FELLER.</p>
<p><strong>11. kate o? ?` ninc door onto arch sees the scone.</strong>:
Five years have done much to her, the girlish play- fulness is gone, she
is a woman settled in grief.</p>
<p><strong>bate</strong>: Helen. She is dorm the steps at once to them,
seizing Ii LE’TT S wrists and lifting her off IARTHA. VINE= runs in and
chases MARTHA and PERCY OFF.</p>
<p>****: `kAT_J Let me have those scissors,</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: SATE reaches for the scissors in HELEN’ S hand.
Put HEL N pulls the scissors bacI.’, they stru g:le ‘for then: a
mno_m.ent, then KATE gives up, lets HELE1.1 keep them. She tries to
drrrr HELEN into the house. HELEN jerks swwray. KATE next goes do.-,rn
on her knees, tskes ?ELE! 1 S hands gently, and using; the scissors like
a doll, m&amp; es HELi N caress and cradle them; she points =,Y’ S
finger houseward.s. III�LEN’ S whole body now beco_nnes ea^er; she
surrenders the scissors, KATE t?’-rns her toward the door and -..hues
her a little pus-1. I LEN scrambles up and toward the h_�u se, and NA=
risin- follows her,</p>
<p><strong>c”.pt_“</strong>: IN KE!,L:<em>R in spectacles is working
over netrs- paper pages at a corner desk; a benign AM1T EV, wearing a
hat, with a sew in-,. basket on a sofa is put- tin the finishing
stitches on a big shapeless doll made out of towels; an ineol ont young
man of I”TE’ S are, JA S 1c</em> tR turns from the window to look at H E
L_,’N. i LE halts, her hands alert to grope, and E KATE turns her to the
AUNT, who gives her the doll, the AUNT is meanwhile speaking to
TELLER.</p>
<p><strong>aunt ev</strong>: Arthur, something ought to be done for that
child.</p>
<p><strong>t-</strong>: A refresh,; ng suggg;estion. ’°l .at?</p>
<p><strong>aunt ev</strong>: ’-Thy, this ver-T famous Perkins School in
Poston; they’re just supposed to do wonders.</p>
<p><strong>ic’eller</strong>: The child’s been to speci lists
everywhere. The- couldn’t help her in Baltimore or 1,1 -7aslaington,
could they?</p>
<p><strong>kell’ r</strong>: :ratie, Howe many tines can you let- then
brew.{ your heart? Any number of tines, h T e foreroinz and follovrin”
dialo,ue is peripheral to the we are on }EL ’ T 1 She sits on the or to
explore the doll t71th h.r fingers, gravely, and her hand pauses over
the face: this is no face, a blan area, and it troubles her. CLOS’_’ UP
on her finger– tips searching for flaatures. She tans ouestioninSly
f’o:’ eyes, but no one notices. She then yanks at her _Jfl’’T1S dress,
and taps amain viForousRy for eyes.</p>
<p><strong>0 c o</strong>: T’! I ICJ n</p>
<p><strong>aunt ev</strong>: What, child? Obviously not hearing, HELEN
commences to go around from person to person, tapping her eyes, but no
one attends or understands.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: As long as there’s the least chance. For her
to see. Or hear, or –</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: There isntt. Now I must finish here.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I think, with your permission, Captain, I’d
like to write to the Perkins School.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: I said no, Katie.</p>
<p><strong>0 aunt ev</strong>: Why, writing does no harm, Arthur, only a
little bitty letter. To see if they can help her.</p>
<p><strong>feller</strong>: They can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We won’t know that; to be a fact, Captain,
until afLLer you write. 13. HELEN NOW IS GROPING AMONG THING.’ ON FELL
ER t S DESK, AND</p>
<p><strong>k i j,er</strong>: Katie. KATE quickly turns HELEN away, and
retrives the papers. I might as well t°y to work in a henyard as in th.s
house –</p>
<p>****: You really ought to put her away, Father.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Some asylum. It’s the kindest thing.</p>
<p><strong>aunt ev</strong>: Why, she’s your sister, James, not a nobody
–</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Half sister, and half-mentally defective, she
can’t even keep herself clean. It’s not pleasant to see her about all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Do you dare? Complain of what 0 you can
see?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: This discussion is at an end] HELEN gropes
her way with the doll back to AUNT EV. The house is at sixes and sevens
from morning ’til night over the childl I want some peace here, I don’t
care how, but one way we won’t have it is by rushing up and down the
country every time someone hears of a new quack. I’m as sensible to this
affliction as –</p>
<p><strong>14. helen with aunt ev</strong>: fingering her dress, yanks
two buttons from it.</p>
<p><strong>aunt ev</strong>: Helena My buttons.</p>
<p><strong>14. continued</strong>: HELEN pushes the buttons into the
doll’s face. KATE 0 now sees, comes swiftly to kneel, lifts HELEN’S hand
to her own eyes in question.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Eyes? HELEN nods energetically. She wants the
doll to have eyes. Another kind of silence now, while KATE takes pins
and buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the doll as
eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches morosely, AUNT EV blinks and
conceals her emotion by inspecting her dress.</p>
<p><strong>aunt ev</strong>: My goodness me, I’m not decent.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: She doesn’t know better, Aunt Ev. I’ll sew
them on again.</p>
<p>****: 40 It’s worth a couple of buttons, Kate, look. HELEN now has
the doll with eyes, and cannot contain herself for joy; she rocks the
doll, pats it vigorously, kisses it. This child has more sense than all
these men Kellers, if there’s ever any way to reach that mind of
hers.</p>
<p><strong>hesitatingly overturns it.</strong>: The swaddled baby
tumbles out and CAPTAIN KELLER barely manages to dive and catch it in
time.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Helen! All are in commotion, the baby
screams, but HELEN un- perturbed is lying her doll in its place, KATE on
her</p>
<p><strong>15. continued</strong>: knees, pulls her hands off the
cradle, wringing them; 0 HELEN is bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Helen, Helen, you’re not to do such things,
how can I make you</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Katie.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: How can I get it into your head, my darling,
my poor –</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Katie, some way of teaching her an iota of
discipline has to be</p>
<p>****: How can you discipline an afflicted child? Is it her fault? 0
HELEN’S fingers have fluttered to her Mother’s lips, vainly trying to
comprehend their movements; we are close on these two.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: I didn’t say it was her fault.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Then whose? I don’t know what to dot How can I
teach her, beat her – until she’s black and blue?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: It’s not safe to let her run around loose.
Now there must be a way of confining her, somehow, so she can’t—</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Where, in a cage? She’s a growing child, she
has to use her limbs!</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Answer me one thing, is it fair to Mildred
here?</p>
<p>****: Are you willing to put her away? Now HELEN’S face darkens in
the same rage as at herself earlier, and her hand strikes at KATE’S
lips. KATE catches her again, and HELEN begins to kick, struggle,
twist.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: She wants to talk, like – be like you and me.
She holds HELEN struggling until we HEAR from the child her first sound
so far, an inarticulate weird noise in her throat such as an animal in a
trap might make; and KATE releases her. The second she is free, HELEN
blunders away collides violently with a chair, falls, and sits weeping.
KATE comes to her, embraces, caresses, soothes her, and buries her own
face in her hair, until she can control her voice.</p>
<p><strong>0 kate</strong>: Every day she slips further away. I don’t
know how to call her back.</p>
<p><strong>aunt ev</strong>: Oh, I’ve a mind to write to Boston myself.
If that School can’t help her, maybe they’ll know somebody who can.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: I’ll write to Perkins, Katie. He stands with
the baby in his clasp, staring at HELEN’S head, hanging down on KATE’S
arm.</p>
<p><strong>of train.</strong>: M.R. ANAGNOS on platform with ANNIE’S
suitcase, is reach- ing up to help ANNIE mount steps. CAMERA is
behind</p>
<p><strong>anagnos</strong>: 0 – only that a suitable governess has been
found here and will come. It will no doubt be difficult for you there,
Annie, but it has been difficult for you at our school too, hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>anagnos</strong>: …-This is my last time to counsel you,
Annie, and you do lack some – by some I mean all – what, tact, or talent
to bencT. To others. And what has saved you on one or more occasions at
Perkins is that there was nowhere to expel you to. Above ANNIEIS seat
ANAGNOS puts her suitcase, looking .down at her. Your eyes hurt?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: My ears, Mr. Anagnos.</p>
<p>****: Nowhere but back to that dreadful place where children learn to
be saucy. Annie, I know how unhappy it was there, but that battle is
dead and done with. Why not let it stay buried?</p>
<p>****: I think God must owe me a resur- rection.</p>
<p><strong>anagnos</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: 0 Well, he keeps digging up that battle.</p>
<p><strong>anagnos</strong>: That is not a proper thing to say. Annie,
be humble. He extends a gift to her.. You’ll need their affection, work-
ing with this child. ANNIE, not quite comprehending, looks at gift. A
gift with our affection. ANNIE opens a small box and sees a garnet ring.
She looks up, blinking, then down.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Dear Mr. Anagnos,</p>
<p><strong>i –</strong>: But she swallows over getting the ring on her
finger and cannot continue until she finds a woebegone joke.</p>
<p>****: That is only half true, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Which half? The train lurches. ANAGNOS bends
and kisses her on the cheek and says,</p>
<p><strong>anagnos</strong>: Goodbye. Goodbye.</p>
<p>****: I won’t give them any trouble. I’ll be so ladylike they won’t
notice I’ve come.</p>
<p><strong>19. continued</strong>: 0 Passengers behind ANNIE turn
reacting to her shout. She is conscious of this and sinks down’in seat.
Past ANNIE, through window of train, we see ANAGNOS join 5 or 6 blind
girls on the platform, and the train departs.</p>
<p><strong>24. annie sitting on seat of moving train.</strong>: Suddenly
train rushes into a tunnel, and darkness comes over the scene.</p>
<p><strong>young jimmie</strong>: Where are we going, Annie?</p>
<p><strong>young annie</strong>: Jimmie.</p>
<p><strong>young jimmie</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>young annie</strong>: I said I’m taking care of you.</p>
<p><strong>young jimmie</strong>: Where we go…</p>

JIMMIE and YOUNG ANNIE are standing in front of desk. We do not see man
sitting behind desk, but we hear his voice.</p>
