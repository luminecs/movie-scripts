<h1 id="mr-brooks">mr-brooks</h1>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: God grant me the Serenity to accept the
things I cannot change…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Courage to change the things I can…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Come on, you’ve been a good boy for a long
time, you deserve a little fun.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … and Wisdom to know the difference.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Living one day at a time, Enjoying one
moment at a time, Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that He will make all things
right if I surrender to His will. That I may be reasonably happy in this
life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I could go on and on about what a great guy
Earl is, how he cuts his toe nails…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: … how he gives freely of his time and money,
but let’s get Earl up here to speak for himself. Ladies and Gentlemen, I
give you a businessman, a philanthropist, a great friend and the
Evanston Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year… Mr. Earl Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Thank you all very much. The first thing
I would like to say is… I don’t even know how I cut my toe nails.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Twenty years ago when I started the
Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed I would one day be standing here.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Did you see Sis Wallace’s dress?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You could see her nipples. At her age she
should keep those things hidden.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: God grant me the Serenity to accept…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: The only thing that would have made this
evening more perfect is if Jane had been here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: She called. She has mid terms coming
up.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: She’s dropping out, you know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Nothing she does is wrong to you, is it?…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Well she missed a good party…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Come on, Earl, give yourself a break, you
know you want to do this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You’re the fucking ‘man of the year’, you
deserve it. It’s not like it’s not set up. You already know how to
by-pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks. Tonight’s the perfect
night.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No, Marshall, I said ‘no’!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I heard you, Earl, but you don’t mean
‘no’.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You were frowning.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I was thinking of what I didn’t say in
the speech.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: They laughed, they were touched, I don’t think
anyone felt left out.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: They have their dance class tonight. What
if we go by and just look at them. There’s no harm in just having a
look.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No means ‘no’, Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Please… pretty please.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The food tonight was very good, but I
wasn’t crazy about the dessert. Would you like to stop somewhere and get
something sweet?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … Labradors are supposed to be nice, or maybe
a rescue mutt…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The Pound’s a pretty sad place; if you
want me to, I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: There’s an Irish Lab I read about, and I think
the breeder is…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I bet your dick’s getting hard, isn’t it,
just imagining what they would look like dead?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … I can’t do this, I can’t do this, I
can’t do this, please don’t let me do this, God grant me the Serenity to
accept the things I cannot change…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’m going to stay up a while, maybe go
to the studio and play with some glazes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Okay, I’m going to read. If I’m not awake,
wake me when you come back.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I thought you were wonderful
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Don’t do this, don’t do this, please
don’t do this, don’t do this, don’t do, please don’t do this…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I’ve missed this!
We are going to have so much fun!</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: This is the last time, Marshall.
Understand me?! The very last time!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Don’t you dare quit on me, you piece of
shit. I want to see what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What the fuck?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, man, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Be quiet and sit up.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is this?!!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: These pigs liked to fuck with the blinds
open, you should have known that, Earl. This is a big mistake for you,
Earl.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Almost like I want to get caught, huh,
Marshall?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Well, don’t fucking do that. I don’t think
either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a
lethal injection.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Please forgive me… Please forgive
me…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Don’t even think about it. You know the
rules.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Now go up and make love to your beautiful
wife.</p>
<p><strong>older detective</strong>: Where the fuck is Atwood?!</p>
<p><strong>young detective</strong>: I called ten minutes ago, they said
she was on her way.</p>
<p><strong>older detective</strong>: She doesn’t get here soon, these
bodies won’t even be dead anymore?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You looking for the lady Cop?</p>
<p><strong>older detective</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: She’s here. She’s been sitting in her car right
over there for the last half hour.</p>
<p><strong>older detective</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>older detective</strong>: You thinking of joining us anytime
soon, Atwood?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I really hated yesterday, Snyder,
and then today came along.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: What happened to your wrists?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I tried to commit suicide.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>young detective</strong>: Eh… I… I don’t know, I heard it was
because you were drunk and got into a fight with a fish tank.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Who are you gonna believe? Me or
the fucking fish?!</p>
<p><strong>young detective</strong>: Eh… you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>young detective</strong>: She’s nuts!</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: And rich.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: There are some scratches in the side door
cylinder. Other than that no signs of forced entry. The alarm was armed
and we even had to cut the security chains to get in.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: This guy hasn’t been active for
over two years…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: … we think he’s either dead or in
jail on some other charge. This is probably a copycat.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: That’s why we called you. You’re the God
that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here or something we can
dump on you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Bite yourself.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: He always rearranges the bodies,
but this is out of character. He has never left them in such a crude
position. Usually it’s more romantic with their arms around each other,
kissing, their mouths open, their tongues touching.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: So we have a copycat?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Where are the thumbprints?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: One his one hers?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: That’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: The bullets went completely through the
victims. The killer recovered the slugs.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Were these open or closed when you
got here?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Closed.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Hmm…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: It has never been revealed to the
public that the Thumbprint Killer retrieves the slugs.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: So this one’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I don’t fucking need this.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Have you checked the tenants of
that building?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Only a few of them are home, they say they
didn’t see anything. We checked the whole neighborhood, so far nobody
saw a thing.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Leaving them like this, he must
have been angry at them for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Where would they keep their vacuum
cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I’ll bet you a hundred bucks,
Snyder, there is no bag in that vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: I have no idea what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: He vacuumed the house and took the
bag.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Oh, shit. That is scary smart.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Our best hope is if someone in
there saw something.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Detective Tracy Atwood?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This is for you.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You have been served.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You fucking asshole!! I’m in the
middle of a fucking murder investigation!!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, take it easy lady, I’m just the
messenger.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Goddamit!!</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: My soon to be ex-husband’s scumbag
lawyer is trying to show me how painful she can make my life if I don’t
give them what they want.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: This is not the Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: The doctor was a couple years ago.
This one is my stupid mistake.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Are there any new members?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hi, my name is Vaughn and I’m an
alcoholic.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Hi, my name is Earl and I’m an
addict.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You’re such a fucking hypocrite. If you
were honest you would step out there and say ‘Hi, I’m Earl. I killed two
people last night and I really got off on it, but I need your help to be
cured.’</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’m different Marshall, I won’t argue
that with you. This is the only place that has ever helped me be normal
and I’ve been straight up until last night for the past two years. I’m
not going to kill again and I’m not going to quit coming here because it
upsets you.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yeah but for the next 29 days you’re going
to have to step out there and say ‘Hi, I’m Earl, I’m an addict.’ And
everybody will know you fell off the wagon. Don’t you feel stupid doing
that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No. I feel good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: This is not the top of the line or the
bottom, but for the money we’re talking about this is the quality I can
provide you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Your packaging is the first impression
your customers will have of your product…</p>
<p><strong>pa system</strong>: Mr. Brooks, your daughter is waiting for
you in your office.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … We’d love to work you with on the
design. It’s fun to challenge our machines. If you check around, you’ll
find we’re not the cheapest, but we are the best.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Sunday, did Jane call and say she was
coming?</p>
<p><strong>sunday</strong>: I would have given you that message,
Mr. Brooks. She has boxes and suitcases downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Hold my calls.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What are you doing here, Gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m sorry, Daddy, please don’t be angry with
me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I can guess what you’ve done, but why
don’t you tell me and then I’ll decide.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I dropped out of school.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Okay. Have you told your mother
this?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No. I wanted to speak to you first.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You’ll have to tell her, I’m not going
to do that for you, and then together the three of us will decide where
to go from here.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’ve thought a lot about this, Dad. College is
a waste of time for me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I don’t know how you know that half way
through your Freshman year, but…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You didn’t go to college, Dad, and you’re
successful. I want to come and work for you.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: She’s not telling you everything, she’s
hiding something.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I know. I’m not hiring right now.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Just listen to me. What would happen to the
business if, God forbid, something happened to you? Mom would probably
have to sell to strangers. I’m willing to start at the bottom, you can
treat me as a regular employee, I want to learn everything there is to
know about running the box business, and then when the time comes, the
business would stay in the family.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: That’s sweet, but you’re talking about
emotion, not business. In fact your mother and I came very close to
selling out last year.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: If we had been offered a little more
money, and they may come back to us, we will sell.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What would you do without…?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sunday</strong>: I’m sorry, I know you didn’t want to be
disturbed, the Man in the waiting room insisted I give you this.</p>
<p><strong>sunday</strong>: He said you would find what’s inside very
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What is he? A salesman?</p>
<p><strong>sunday</strong>: He won’t say. I’ve never seen him before. I
can tell him to go away if you want me to.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Part of spending the four years in
college is to…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … eh… to give yourself the chance to
find out who you are and what you want to do.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’ll talk to Mom, but I’m not going back to
school.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Where would you live?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: To save money I would move back home, but no
rules, no curfew, I want to be treated like an adult.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Would you pay for your food, would you
pay rent?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No, dad, you’re a very wealthy man, you can
afford to keep me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Sunday, would you show the gentleman who
gave you the envelope to the conference room, and tell him I’ll meet him
there and… What happened to the BMW?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: A friend is driving it across country, it’ll
be here next weekend.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: And get Jane a cab.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Call your mother.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Are you going to give me a job?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: If it were up to me, and I think your
mother will agree with this, you should go back to school.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You see all of this?! The factory, the
houses, the cars, the money, the respect!!…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … I like them! I don’t want to lose
them!</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … That’s why I didn’t want to do the
dance Couple!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Stop your fucking whining, Earl, you
enjoyed doing that Couple just as much as I did, and look on the bright
side, he came to us he didn’t go to the Cops. If he tries to shake us
down we kill him. Period. We make it fun but we kill him. End of
story.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What can I do for you, Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: … Let’s say, ‘Smith’.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Okay, Mr. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Before you get the wrong impression,
Mr. Brooks, I’m not here to shake you down.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Then these are the only copies of these
photos and you have no others.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No. I have other copies and other photos,
and if something were to happen to me…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: How did you find me, Mr. Smith?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You’re ‘Man of the Year’, Mr. Brooks.
Your picture was in the paper. If it hadn’t been, I don’t know what I
would have done.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Lucky me. What is it that I can help you
with?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’ve been watching that Couple for
months, they liked to make love with the blinds open. Sometimes I would
take pictures, you know, visual aides for later. It was fun, it was a
great way to get off; I thought, until I saw you kill them. I have to
tell you I have never ever felt a rush like that ever. I know you’re the
Thumbprint killer, you’ve done this before. What I want is to go with
you the next time you kill someone. And I would like that to be
soon.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And you were worried that this was going
to be unpleasant. The answer is simple. Just tell him you’ve decided
never to kill again and he’ll go away.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You enjoy watching me suffer, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: In a word, yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Where do you think he has the other
pictures?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He put them in a safety deposit box but
I’ll bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and
the key is on his keychain. He really wants to do this, he’s not going
to go to the cops.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: So do we have a deal?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: From the angle of these pictures… … you
live on the third floor of the apartment building across the alley from
the Couple’s house.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Well… eh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes or no, Mr. Smith?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What time do you get home from work?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Six thirty, seven, depending on the
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You can never come here again, you can
never call me. Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Tomorrow night, not tonight, tomorrow
night, at eight o’clock, leave your apartment and walk east. I’ll pick
you up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: If you’re thinking of doing anything to
me, Mr. Brooks…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: We’re both aware of the rules,
Mr. Smith, but I feel I must warn you. If it turns out that you enjoy
killing, it can become very addictive. It could ruin your life.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I want to do this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Have I covered everything?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I can’t think of anything else.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow night,
Mr. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Please God, please help me find a way
not to do this.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: We’ve talked to our client and we’ve
come up with a number that we feel is more than fair.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: We can have a check for that amount
in your office by 6 o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: We told you at the beginning what we want
and that hasn’t changed.</p>
<p><strong>gray-haired attorney</strong>: You know as well as I do,
Counselor, if we go to court you’re not going to get a million five.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I don’t know. Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: This is the front page of yesterday’s paper…
‘Hangman Escapes’… eh… now, here it is… ‘after torturing the young
women, Thorton Meeks would hang them in public places - church steeples,
balconies, Freeway overpasses’… Your client captured Mr. Meeks. This is
just one example of the cases my client lived through when he was
married to your client.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Your client knew Detective Atwood
was a homicide detective when he married her.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: But he had no idea of the mental anguish
that being in close proximity to her work would cause him.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What about the mental anguish I
went through being in close proximity to him. Who’s gonna pay me for
that?</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: We don’t need to get into this,
Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Yes, we do. I was the one who paid
for everything while we were married, and now I’m being asked to give
him a bonus for spending time with me when I’ve already paid for it in
the first place.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Tracy, this is not a lot of money for you,
and you know how upset I was when Meeks said that he was going to escape
and he would come back and kill you.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: We’re quite willing to find out what a court
would think that mental anguish is worth.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Jesse… Darling?… you know the best
thing that could happen to me right now? That you get hit by a truck and
die.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: That’s it! Mr. Vialo and I are leaving.
You’ve threatened my client, we’re going to ask for a restraining order,
and we’ll see you in court.</p>
<p><strong>gray-haired attorney</strong>: That’s going to cost you,
Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Fuck it. It felt good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Don’t worry, if I were here to kill you,
you would already be dead.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: After you left today, I realized our
friendship was a little one- sided.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: So when we meet tomorrow night would you
be so kind as to bring all of the pictures and the memory card from your
camera. That way we can like each other simply for who we are. If you
don’t show up, I will presume you’ve gone to the police and I will kill
you. Even if I go to jail because of you, someone will find you wherever
you are and kill you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Mr. Brooks?…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Mr. Brooks?…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Wow!…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: It’s nice to have you home.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Ask your daughter what the real reason is she
dropped out of school.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I keep telling you it’s not the reason.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You wanted to go to college, you had good
grades in High School, your father helped you get into Stanford, we’re
paying a ton of money, if this is not the reason, then please dear God
tell me the reason.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Why does your mother think you dropped
out of school?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m pregnant. And it’s not the reason I
dropped out. Being pregnant wouldn’t stop me from going to school if I
wanted to go.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Who’s the father?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Some guy I was seeing.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Does he know?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes, he’s a married man and he doesn’t want to
have anything to do with me.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Oh, Honey, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m going to have an abortion anyway, so there
is nothing to get upset about. I wasn’t even going to tell you guys.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: There will be no abortion.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Daddy, you are not going to tell me what to
do. It’s my body and I will do what I want to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You’re right. I’m sorry. I said it
wrong. I’m not trying to tell you what to do. I’m trying to say that a
grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Please, Honey, don’t have an abortion.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Would you really want to have a grandchild,
even though I’m not married?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes. The child is what’s important. We
would love it and cherish it completely and help you raise it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: If it means that much to you, I’ll think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Well, we were right, she was hiding
something.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Pregnant’s not all of it. She’s hiding
something bigger. Much bigger.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I know so, and so do you.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s not what’s here, it’s what’s not
here that’s interesting. There’s not a trace of anything foreign. If I
didn’t know better I’d say these people were killed by a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: The autopsy found a tiny piece of
plastic in the female victim’s brain.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: We’re checking with the ammunition
manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That’s a dead end, he bags the
gun.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: He ziplocks a one gallon plastic
freezer bag to his wrist over the gun. Bang. Bang. A little bit of
plastic is carried by the first slug, the ejected shells go into the bag
and it limits the powder residue. I hear you were looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Sigy…</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: Yeah, okay… Did you find anything? Did they
have enemies, did they owe money, did anybody ever notice someone
watching the house?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: So far they are Mr. and Miss
Normal.</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: If you find anything, call, it might help
me.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: I received a subpoena from your
husband’s lawyer for your work records, where you were, date and times
for the past two years.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That’s blackmail.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Almost three quarters of your cases
are current. I can’t let that information go into open court. So until
you settle your divorce, I’m going to have to put you on a desk.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That’s also blackmail.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: That’s one of your big problems,
Atwood, you don’t know how to ask for help.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Do you know what he did to me?</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: You can’t grow old as a woman
without having at least one lousy man in your life.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I was so stupid. While we were
married, while I paid for him to live, the son of a bitch fucked every
woman he could get his hands on. He fucked my friends, he even fucked a
cousin of mine. Everyone knew but me, and they were laughing at me
behind my back. He made me look like an idiot. I was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: And?…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: And what?</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Get over it.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I made him an offer. I’m not going
to give him one red cent more.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: I hear what he’s asking for, you
could take out of pocket change. Do that and go on with your life.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I couldn’t live with myself if I
did.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: I’ll spread your work among the
other guys and the FBI will be here on thursday… … they’ll take over
this case.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Please, these are my cases. Nobody
knows them like me. Don’t give them away and don’t give the Thumbprint
Killer to the FBI. He’s killed people in twelve other states, let them
fuck up those investigations. This one’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: You heard Meeks escaped?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Do you want a detail on you in case
he comes after you?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: You’re a good cop, Tracy, I don’t
want to lose you, but you have to help me if you want me to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What is wrong with me? What is
wrong with me? What is wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Did you choose them because of
where they lived or how they looked or what jobs they had? Or did you
just pick them because at the instant you saw them, you had decided to
kill someone? The side door was perfect. No one could see you pick the
lock.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: How did you know where they were
in the house?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: It’s darker tonight than it was on
your night. But still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture?
Did you have a little light? That would be too dangerous. I’ll bet you
were in the house before.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: So I should ask the neighbors if
they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or
someone from the gas company.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Once again, how did you know where
they were? Did you check the rooms before you found them? She had his
semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was
there a light on?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: And when did you bag the gun?
Because even though I’m sure you’re an expert at it, there’s still a
chance of noise from the plastic.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Was the door open or did you have
to open it?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Were they asleep or awake? Was the
light on, or did you turn it on? Because I know you, you wouldn’t risk a
shot in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Too bright. What if it wasn’t that
light that was on, but this one?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That’s better… What thrill do you
get by killing people? Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do you
feel remorse? Probably that part of your brain doesn’t exist. Do you
have emotions of love or affection or joy? Or have you learned to fake
them so you won’t stand out in a crowd.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What if these are stuck closed
because you yanked them closed? Which means they were open when you came
into the room.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: If Mr. and Miss Normal made love
with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building
noticed them and may have seen you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Was that what you were angry
about?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Oh! You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I’m sorry… … I was about to knock.
I’m Detective Atwood with the Chicago Police.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Are you a photographer…
Mr. Baffert?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No… eh, it’s kind of a hobby, I just
started.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I don’t know if you’re aware but
there was a murder…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Oh, yes in the house across the
alley…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Did you happen to see anything
unusual or suspicious that night around that house? Anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No… I wondered that when I heard what
happened, but… no. I’m sorry, I’m meeting someone and I don’t want to be
late.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Here’s my card, if you hear
anything or remember anything.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I wish I could be of more help, but
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: He looks clean. He looks like he’s
alone.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No, I’m telling you he wants to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I guess I should turn around and go pick
him up.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Nah. Just honk. Maybe he’ll get killed
crossing the street and save us the mess of doing it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Woof! It’s really coming down out
there.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: They say it’ll be sunny tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I never trust those guys, when they say
it’s going to be clear it always rains and when they say it’s going to
rain, it’s sunny.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Here’s what you asked for.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The pictures and the memory card all
here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You and I both know that not all the
pictures are in here and you made a copy of the Memory Card, isn’t that
so?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: But you understand my position.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes, I do. But it’s my hope that once
you get to know me better you’ll feel comfortable in giving me all that
I’ve asked for.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That sounds fair. Oh, I almost forgot. I
thought you might be interested in this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: It’s the policewoman who’s looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Wow! We’ve never known anyone who’s
looking for us before.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We’ve got to find out everything there is
to know about this woman.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: This is too close, Marshall, too damn
close.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: So, what do we do now? What’s the plan
for the evening?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: We drive around until we see someone we
think we might enjoy killing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Really? That’s it? I thought you might
already have someone in mind.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I don’t enjoy this, Mr. Smith. I do it
because I’m addicted to it. And before you entered my life I had vowed I
would never kill again. So this is your party, you can chose anyone you
want and we’ll do it together.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Can it be someone I know?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You never kill someone you know. That’s
the easiest way to get caught.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I wasn’t in town that night, my roommate
was, maybe he saw something.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: May I speak to him?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: He’s on his way to Tokyo now, he’s also
a Flight Attendant.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Did the victims ever leave the
curtains in the bedroom open?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: All the time. I don’t know if they
thought we couldn’t see them “fucking” or they didn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Here’s my card, could you ask your
roommate to call me when he gets back, the people at that number will
find me any hour of the day or night.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I won’t be here, but I’ll leave him a
note.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … maybe I already know how to pick the
locks on the house, if I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … I buy one of those locks and I
practice on it, same with the alarm… some I know how to bypass, some I
have to study.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You don’t mind me asking these
questions?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No. This is your first time, you’re
interested. And you should be if you’re…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Jesus Christ!!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Fuck him!! It was his fault!! What an
asshole!!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill the
driver of the pickup.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What about the driver of the pickup?
What if we killed him?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Oh, fuck, yes!! I’ve always wanted to
kill someone who fucked with me in traffic.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Do you want to kill the driver of the
pickup or the owner, they may not be the same.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: The driver.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Okay we’ll follow until we get a look at
him, or her; would it bother you to kill a woman?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No. An asshole’s an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The asshole shouldn’t know we’ve decided
to follow him, or her.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: It’s Tracy. Can you carve out some
time for me tonight?… I’ll be home in an hour and a half. I’ll see you
there.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Would you recognize him if you saw his
driver’s license picture?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’ve memorized the license number, you
write it down. When you get home go on the Internet and find out
everything you can about this guy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: We aren’t going to kill him tonight?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No. We could, but then we wouldn’t be in
control. We could leave loose ends, and we both know the danger of
that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Close your eyes. What’s the number?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: VF… eh…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Don’t feel bad, I’ve been doing this a
long time… Pen, paper. Write it down.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What was your first time?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You really don’t want to know that much
about me, Mr. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hi. I brought a dress and a pair of shoes. I
thought we could leave from here.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Great idea.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: … I gave him my driver’s license, my student
ID, he didn’t look anything like me, luckily they never checked.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I did something like that except I
was the one who took the test. It wasn’t math, a friend of mine was a
theology major and needed a second language to get into the Master’s
program…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She started her career in theology with a
lie?!</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Isn’t that what all theology is
based on?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Did you pass the test?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Oh yeah…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Don’t tell me she ended up as Mother Teresa
or the Pope.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: No, she realized very quickly
there wasn’t enough money in religion for her, the last I heard she’d
written a diet book that was very successful.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She stayed in religion.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Thank you, this was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: For me too.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’ll see you then?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I’d like that. The money is in the
usual place.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s not just the money, Tracy. I like
you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I like you too, Larry. Send me a
bill for the dress and the shoes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I will. Good-night.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Good-night.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I think that was right. Go back.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: We’re in.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: With the taxes we pay, you’d think they
could make it more difficult to hack into the Police personnel
files.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: …. Huh… her father’s Gerald Atwood, why
does that ring a bell?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Someone you did business with, someone we
killed?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Not someone we killed… MBA… College of
William and Mary… she’s been a cop for eleven years… Married Doctor
Carlson, divorced Dr. Carlson, married Jesse Vialo… restaurateur…
separated from Jesse Vialo, sued for support by Jesse Vialo, seeing a
shrink because of Jesse Vialo…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Excellent fitness report though.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: She caught the Hangman, the guy that
escaped the other day…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Oooh… She’s caught a lot of people… And
look here, this isn’t the first time she’s been hunting for us.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I wonder what the deal was with her and
Jesse Vialo?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Ahhhh… now I remember. Her father,
Gerald Atwood, never did business with him but Emma and I met him a
couple times, big political fundraiser. He owns or owned one of the
largest insurance groups in the country and a lot of other stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Jesse Vialo… Good looking, a little
younger than she is.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Younger, restaurateur… She married him on
the rebound from the doctor and I’ll bet he married her for her money
and her connections.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The old man being rich doesn’t mean
she’s rich. Maybe he’s one of those guys who would rather give it to the
Opera than to his kids.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Wouldn’t she have to declare any outside
income and holdings to the Police?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The Opera didn’t get much.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Why would a woman with her education and
worth 60 plus million dollars and probably more to come, want to be a
cop?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I like that about her.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You’re such a fucking snob, Earl. You like
her because she’s rich.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No, I like her because she found
something that’s hers. It’s not the family business. And she’s good at
it. I’d like Jane to find something that’s hers and that she could be
good at.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That’s exactly why Atwood scares the shit
out of me. She’s a cop who doesn’t need the money and she’s looking for
us. That’s one fucking dangerous human being.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The fact that you’re not wrong doesn’t
make me admire her any less.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Hi. I got you a Latte.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Thanks and thanks for meeting me
here.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: We got an injunction to quash the
subpoena for your work records yesterday. They’ve already appealed.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That doesn’t help me does it?</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Your father has a lot of political
muscle.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: My father does nothing for
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: I understand. If you’re willing to
play the game and ride a desk for a year; I think we can settle for one
two five, one five.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: No desk.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Then the only other option is money.
Tell me how high you are willing to go.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: One five.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: I can try. If I were on the other
side I’d hold out for more.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: How much more?</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Give me a cap and that’s how high
we’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Try and get a number out of them
first. I want to know what ballpark I’m playing in and if it’s a lump
sum, is it less than something that’s paid in installments.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: I’ll call them today.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I’d like to get this done as soon
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Are you working on the Thumbprint
Killer this time?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: That one’s creepy to me. The doors
are locked, the alarms are armed and the people are dead. It makes you
feel like you’re not safe anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Where are you parked?</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: I’m right over there.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I’m down the street. Call me as
soon as you have something.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Oh, Tracy… I almost forgot, your
husband says there’s a picture of him holding some trophy that you still
have.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: He took all those pictures. He
took everything.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: He claims it’s his favorite picture
and you put it up where you store your suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I’ll look.</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: I know it’s petty, but you’re going
through a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>meeks</strong>: Surprise, surprise, Tracy. I told you I was
coming back to get you.</p>
<p><strong>meeks</strong>: I already know where I’m gonna hang you. But
first I’m gonna watch her… … have some fun with you, then she’s gonna
watch me have some fun with you.</p>
<p><strong>meeks</strong>: Now, don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>meeks</strong>: You know the drill, I’m gonna put the cuffs
on.</p>
<p><strong>meeks</strong>: Now the left.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: We found the van in an underground
lot about two miles from where they left you. It was stolen last
night.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: These are the women we have pictures of who
know Meeks.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Meeks and the Woman, none of the
Attendants remember seeing them.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That chiropractor, Alvin Griffin,
who sold Meeks his steroids, he might know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: His phone’s been tapped since Meeks
escaped. No contact that way so far and he’s sure not going to talk to
us.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What about a warrant to search his
house? Get me in the door and he’ll talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: How’s your divorce going?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I took your advice and told my
lawyer to settle.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: None of these is the woman in the
van.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Whoa… I’m sewing up your head here.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: And your ego can handle that?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: It doesn’t like any of the other
choices.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Until Meeks is caught, Snyder is
with you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Nothing personal, Snyder. He’s not
part of our team.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: He’s there to protect you. And
listen to him, he’s been alive longer than you have.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: I didn’t volunteer for this, Atwood.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: The Parking Lot has a security
camera. We’re checking the tape. If Meeks and the Woman left in a car
we’ll have a license number. You have two days then I want a progress
report on your divorce.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I think I have all the pieces on
the Thumbprint Killer, I’m just not looking at them the right way.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Okay, you have three days.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Every babysitter I ever had loved
me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Maybe he went home with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Can you still see his pickup?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: This is not the kind of guy who leaves
his pickup in an unguarded Lot overnight.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Where do we know that guy from?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You really should pay more attention to
what you read, Earl.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: That’s what I have you for,
Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: His picture was on the front page of the
paper a couple days ago because he escaped from jail. He’s the killer
they call the Hangman.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Ahh…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Remember that cop you like, Atwood, who’s
chasing us, she’s the one who put him away. I think his name is Thorton
Meeks.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Well, well, well… What would life be
without surprises?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You know what’s weird? I’ll bet he has
all these plans of what he’s going to do tonight and tomorrow and he
doesn’t know he will already be dead and won’t be able to do any of
them.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I don’t think I want to kill this
guy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What?! But you promised we would!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Oh, I love what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You have no idea what I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Oh yes I do, and it’s wonderfully
twisted.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I know I said we would, but I don’t
think it would be that much fun.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: So just like that, you’re saying ‘no’,
it’s not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You get the number?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Mr. Smith wants you to notice he’s
pouting.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I know you’re upset, Mr. Smith, and I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yeah, I am upset.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Maybe I was a little abrupt back there,
but let me explain. Finding someone you think would be fun to kill is a
bit like falling in love. You meet a lot of candidates, and you like
some of them and they’re nice, but they’re not right; and then that
special one shows up and your heart beats faster and you know that’s the
one. The man in the pickup did not make my heart beat faster.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Okay, he did not make your heart beat
faster. If not him, who?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I don’t know, I think I have someone in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Do you need me to do any work on it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No, let’s see how it plays out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You see? That’s my problem. That makes me
feel like I’m being jerked around, Mr. Brooks. I thought it was
happening last night, then it was happening tonight. And now it’s “Let’s
see how it plays out”.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I feel like you’re planning to back out
on our deal and I don’t like that feeling at all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I promise you, it will happen.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: When? That’s what I want to know,
Mr. Brooks. When?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Tomorrow night, same time. When you come
out of your building, turn right, go to the first street you can go west
on, I’ll pick you up on that street.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I want to do this. But if it drags on too
long, I could change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Don’t you think I want to do this,
Mr. Smith?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Maybe you don’t anymore.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Even if that guy was charming and funny I
still wouldn’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Hi, what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: I’m Detective Smolny with the Chicago
Police and this is Detective Carfagno, from Palo Alto, California…</p>
<p><strong>carfagno</strong>: We’d like to speak to Jane Brooks, if
that’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Jane is my daughter, what’s this
about?</p>
<p><strong>carfagno</strong>: There was a murder at Stanford not long
before she left. She may be able to help us.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Is she a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>carfagno</strong>: Not at this time. We simply would like to
ask her some questions.</p>
<p><strong>smolny</strong>: Is your daughter here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes… she is.</p>
<p><strong>carfagno</strong>: The questions won’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’m sure you would have no objection if
she had an attorney present.</p>
<p><strong>smolny</strong>: That’s fine. Here’s my card. We can schedule
a time for later today or tomorrow for her to come in to see us.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: If you gentlemen can wait, I will call
my lawyer right now and see what we can work out.</p>
<p><strong>smolny</strong>: Oh, that’s even better.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Would you like some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>smolny</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We both knew she was hiding something
bigger, I certainly didn’t think it was this big.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: She’s not a suspect, Marshall. She may
not have anything to do with it at all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Did Jane ever tell you that there was a
murder at her school?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Nothing? Not that a friend died or
someone she knew died? Or someone in her dorm died?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: There are two Detectives downstairs, one
is from Palo Alto, they want to ask her some questions about a murder
that occurred shortly before she came home.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Oh, my Gosh! I’m sure if she was close to
someone who was murdered, she would have said something.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I called Roger, he suggested a criminal
attorney, they’ll be here within the hour.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ll get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Mr. Clifford, it was a pleasure. Thank
you for coming on such short notice.</p>
<p><strong>heavyset lawyer</strong>: There won’t be any more dropping by
like they did today, they’ll call us first.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Thanks again, Roger. It was a good idea
to hear what they wanted to know sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><strong>mr. clifford</strong>: We’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You did good, Kid. Your answers were
clear, concise and honest. And when they tried to trip you up, it didn’t
work.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I hope so. I’m not feeling so well.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Should you lie down?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I think I’d better.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Try and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I think Roger has a handle on this. He
and Mr. Clifford will take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about it, Daddy.
It was horrible but I really didn’t know the guy that well. It happened
at about the same time I found out I was pregnant, and it just went out
of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: God grant me the Serenity to accept the
things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom
to know the difference…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: God help me. What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: She did it, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yeah. It’ll take the Cops a week to ten
days to put their case together and then they’ll come back and arrest
her.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’ve been afraid of this since the day
she was born. She has what I have.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yes, she does. But you’ve always been
smart about it. She was stupid. She did it because she got off on it,
she did it for fun. Why didn’t she think it through? A hatchet! And she
left it there!!</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: They were pretty graphic, weren’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That was to shock her into making a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What does she think I think? Doesn’t she
remember what she told me? That the BMW was being driven across country
by a friend and now right in front of me, she tells the Cops it was
stolen.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You’ve always cleaned up after her,
whatever she did, all her life.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: If the BMW has anything incriminating in
it, I hope it was stolen or she dropped it at the bottom of a very deep
lake.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Do you think she knows what kind of
trouble she’s in?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I think she thought she had gotten away
with it until the Cops showed up. I should have listened to her, it was
there. She was telling me. ‘I didn’t quit school because I was
pregnant’. I should have dug deeper.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And where would you be but at the exact
same place you are now. It is not your fault, Earl. Part of your problem
with her is that you always think it is.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: She has what I have, Marshall. So on a
very basic level, it is my fault.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Maybe the best thing for her would be to
let her go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And what about her child?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Emma and I would raise it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You might be right, Earl, you might be.
Because you know if she’s not stopped, she’s going to do it again. And
if she wants to take over the box business, the next victim could be
you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I don’t think she’d go that far.</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: We found traces of this in two places.</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: Here and here.</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: We did an analysis and it’s made up of
feldspar, alumina and kaolin.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: A high fire stoneware clay.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Like you make ashtrays and vases from?</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: This is more plates and teacups. It was
slightly wet when whoever it was tracked it into the house and it stuck
to the carpet fibers. We’re thinking it was the killer.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: It could have been tracked in by a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: That’s the thing, you see, the friend would
have had to have been there almost at the same time the killer was.
Otherwise the samples would have been dry and the killer would have
vacuumed them up.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Is the clay rare, is it difficult
to get?</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: You can buy it almost anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: That’s not much help, Sigy.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: And this is the only incongruity
you were able to find in the whole house.</p>
<p><strong>sigy</strong>: We’ve done everything we know how to do. It
sure doesn’t break the case wide open, does it?.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: No, Sigy, it doesn’t. It does give
me an excuse to ask someone some new questions.</p>
<p><strong>sunday</strong>: Yes, Mr. Brooks?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Before you open your mouth, be very sure
this is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I will never be sure.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You get pissed at me because I’m always
the one arguing to go ahead and do murder. Not this time, Earl. This is
your decision.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I know it’s wrong. In my heart I know
it’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Then don’t do it. Go with Mr. Smith
tonight and end that, then let the Police put Jane in jail. Hopefully
that will save her and we can happily go on with our tortured lives.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: That’s exactly what I want to do. That’s
exactly what I should do. The thing is, she’s my daughter and I love
her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’m going home. Cancel everything for
the rest of the day. I might be in tomorrow afternoon. I’ll let you know
about that.</p>
<p><strong>sunday</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: If you need me, need me, call my studio,
that’s where I’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I probably won’t pick up, just leave a
message.</p>
<p><strong>sunday</strong>: I’ll try not to bother you.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The thing that bothers me about this,
besides the fact we’re not prepared, and a multitude of other things, is
what does Mr. Smith do when he’s walking west tonight and you don’t show
up. That little freak could flip out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’ll take care of it on the way to the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Not - able - to - meet -</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: - tonight - Do - it - same -</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: - time - tomorrow -</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: - night - Don’t - be - stupid -.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You remember me?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Would you step out of the car,
please, I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: So Mr. Baffert, what is that you
have to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What do you mean? I don’t have anything
to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Really? Because I was driving
around and I got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me
about the murders.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That’s disappointing. Because when
I left you the last time we talked, I felt I had missed a clue that was
right in front of me that would solve this whole case.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I don’t know why you would feel that.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Didn’t you tell me you were an
amateur potter, that you made bowls and vases?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No, I said I was an amateur
photographer.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Are you positive? Because we found
potter’s clay on the carpet of the murder house and I was sure you said
to me that you worked with clay, that you made pots.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No. I said my hobby was photography, not
pottery.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Maybe that was it. The Stewardess
upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love.
Could I see some of the pictures you took of that Couple?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Don’t - be - stupid -.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You are harassing me, Detective Atwood.
You know very well I’m not a potter and I don’t have any pictures! So my
feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car
and let me go home.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: What is your job here? What do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’m a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You have to be pretty smart for
that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Then be smart, Mr. Baffert. You
lied to me right there at the end. I’ll be watching you. And when you
want to tell me the truth, you know how to get in touch with me.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: See you later, alligator.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Goddamit…</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Captain Lister got us the search warrant for
Meeks’ Chiropractor.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Good. Goddamit!, that guy knows
something… He almost told me and then something happened.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: You think he did it?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I don’t think it’s that
simple.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Here you are, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: God grant me the Serenity to accept the
things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom
to know the difference…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You’re awfully quiet back there.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed policeman</strong>: Mr. Alvin Griffin, this is the
Chicago Police.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed policeman</strong>: We have a warrant to search
your home and premises. We’re coming in.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Lights don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: We have a dead woman in here.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I thought you were behind me.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: The living room is clean.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Snyder, meet Mona.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed policeman</strong>: I called it in.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Do that outside.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Meeks did this.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: I thought Meeks hung people.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Meeks is a steroid freak. This
Refrigerator was always full of steroids. Mona was Alvin Griffin’s
niece, receptionist, lover and keeper of the keys.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Well, the steroids are certainly
gone.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: You think Meeks has Alvin with him?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Meeks thinks Alvin turned him
in.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Let’s go see what’s in the rest of
the house.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Snyder, this is Alvin Griffin.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Dirty.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That’s understandable. You’ve never killed
for this reason before. The feeling will go away.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I don’t think so. It’s the whole thing,
Marshall. If I could find a way to just disappear, where there was
absolutely no trace of me; because eventually I will get caught doing
this. And it’ll be very embarrassing for me and Emma and Jane. So I’ve
been thinking… is there a way that Mr. Smith could kill me and make me
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Number one, Mr. Smith is not smart enough
to do that. Number two, there is no reason, if you’re careful, to
believe you will ever get caught.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I know I will have to plan it for
Mr. Smith, but I think that’s what I want to do.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’m not particularly fond of that plan,
Earl. Remember if you die, I go with you and I like being alive. I like
eating, I like fucking, I like killing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I have to end it, Marshall. One way or
the other. And I think this is the best way.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Well fuck you then.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You worked all night.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I had ideas for pots that took too long
and the clay kept winning… I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: And there’s a yellow Chinese glaze I’m
trying to get right…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>asian attorney</strong>: Hi Tracy, this is Nancy Tang. We
received a counter offer. Are you sitting down?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Yeah, go ahead… He can’t get that,
can he?!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No, my sense of it is by asking for five,
they’re hoping you’ll settle anywhere between two five and three.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Never. How long can you stall
them?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: They know you want this done quickly, so
they’re going to expect a quick counter offer.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I need two days. Wait two days
before getting back to them. If they call, tell them it’s a big number,
I’m thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: And the picture he wanted…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: … tell him I couldn’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Earl… Earl…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Huh?…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Roger is on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, Hi, Daddy, I thought you’d already be
gone.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Roger called. There was another murder
last night near Stanford.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Done the same way as the one they talked
to you about. Right down to the hatchet being left at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: They think they have a serial killer.
Obviously you were here last night, so you’re in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That’s good news, isn’t it? I mean even if
you’re innocent it’s good news to know you’re not a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Oh, yeah. How’s the morning sickness? Do
you want to ride in with me today?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I feel fine, but I don’t know how long that
will last.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Do you love me, Jane?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Of course I love you, daddy, you’re my
father.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Have you decided whether or not to keep
the baby?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: What are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: ‘Are we there yet?’ , are we there
yet?’ , you sound like a child. We’re playing a hunch.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: We’ve been following this guy all day, he’s
boring, and everything we run on him comes up clean.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: If it didn’t, it wouldn’t be
called a hunch.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Meeks’ finger-prints were all over the
chiropractor, the note, refrigerator, he’s the guy we should be looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Look where? Please tell me.
Everyone knows who Meeks is and is looking for him. The chiropractor was
the last link to his old life that I know of. The only way we’ll find
him, now, is if someone turns him in or we trip over him at a bus stop.
On the other hand, Detective Snyder, no one knows who the Thumbprint
Killer is or where he is. However, I have a fucking hunch this guy
Baffert does. I have two days to play that hunch. If you feel like
you’re wasting your time with me, I’d be happy to do it alone.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: I had a fight with my wife this morning;
what’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: My husband wants five million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Bad news?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Lister is pulling you off this case.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Maybe they caught him.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: No. She would have said that.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: You want to keep following him?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Lister only said you were off the case, not
me.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Good thinking, Tonto.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Shit! She just 86’ed you too.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Is she in?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: She’s with someone.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You promised if I settled my
divorce I had three days on the Thumbprint Killer. I have the rest of
today and tomorrow left.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: Detective Atwood, meet FBI Agents
Longnecker and Campbell, they’re taking over your investigation.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You promised you would keep them
out of it for three days.</p>
<p><strong>captain lister</strong>: They won’t allow me to keep that
promise.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: This is my case, what you’re doing
is fucked. But since I can’t stop you, and she won’t, here’s a tip.
James Baffert, you should stake him out, he knows something.</p>
<p><strong>detective longnecker</strong>: We have some other ideas we
are looking into.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Then what’s the problem? You do
that and I’ll tail Baffert.</p>
<p><strong>detective longnecker</strong>: Thank you for all your good
work, Detective. This is our case now.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Good luck. Later I suppose you’ll
fill me in on what I’m supposed to be doing around here. I’m
confused.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s time to go.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, I have a
terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration, I
have decided to disappear. Don’t try to find me, I don’t want to be
found. Please believe that the time I spent with you brought me the
greatest joy of my life. Love. Dad.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: So you’re going to go through with it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: It’s all planned to work out,
Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Are you ready to rock and roll,
Mr. Smith?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I smell gun oil, a gun oil that’s
different than yours.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: He brought his gun. After he gets what
he wants he plans to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Ah… now I get it. You were counting on
that, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: It has a certain logic.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: But if your plan is to have him kill you,
why do you have to kill someone else first?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: He’ll need to see that to get up the
courage to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Not even you believe that, Earl. It makes
it more exciting, doesn’t it, to think he’s going to kill you after you
kill someone else. You’re getting your rocks off big time, that’s why
you’re doing it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Not true… and if it were, so what?
You’re goddamn great, you know. To have the balls to do this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’m pretty nervous but that’s normal
right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Perfectly normal.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Hello… Oh, yes, yes. Put him
through… Hi, this is Detective Atwood speaking, thanks for calling…Yes,
your roommate said you were in Tokyo… Anything, if you saw anything at
all it might be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: The weird thing is that they
closed their curtains, at first they were open like they always were and
they were making love, which they always did, and then when I looked
again the curtains were closed, and there were what looked like camera
flashes coming from behind the curtains.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Camera flashes?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: That’s what it looked like.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: That’s why he poses them.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: I wish I could be more helpful, I
didn’t see the killer or anything like that, but since it was weird I
thought I should call.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You’ve been very helpful. This
answers a lot of questions for me. Thank you very much, Mr. Struber.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: The guy you should talk to is the
guy on the floor below us…</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: eh, I can’t remember his name, but
he told me once that he’d taken some great pictures of that Couple
making love, he’s the one you should speak to.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Would that be, Mr. Baffert?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Yeah, I think Jim or James…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Snyder, meet me at Baffert’s
apartment with a Search Warrant… Listen to me, this is what you tell the
judge.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Put these on.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Try a couple deep breaths through your
nose.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I have to take a crap so bad.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: This won’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I called your wife’s lawyer. They’re
thinking about the five million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Realistically how much do you think we can
get?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: If we go to court, best case, two, if she
wants to settle, best case, three, but I would be happy with two
seven.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think we should hold firm for three.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Let’s not be piggish, two five, two seven,
would be a good deal.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: You’ve already had half a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re late; if we want it, there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: To us.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: To three million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: We have to do this fast because remember,
Marie is meeting us here.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: We could ask her to join us.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Not funny.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I wasn’t trying to be.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Are we alone?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Mr. Baffert?… Mr. Baffert?</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Do you have any idea when he’ll be
back?</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: He skipped out. I heard him leave this
evening and a few minutes later there were Movers here. Musta been
behind on the rent. He didn’t even say good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Obviously Baffert’s gone…</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Goddamit, Snyder. Knock.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: I wasn’t able to get the search warrant.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: We may have gotten lucky. This is
the Moving Company’s work order and… … it looks like this is the address
where they’re taking Baffert’s stuff.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Where were you when you called me?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: At home in bed.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Can you prove that?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I was home in bed, why should I
have to prove that?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Your husband Jesse and his lawyer were
killed tonight…</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: It looks like the Thumbprint Killer, I’ve
been ordered to bring you in for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Why, I didn’t want Jesse dead, I
loved him, I hated what he was doing to me…</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: It’s on record you said you’d like him dead
and who better to fake a Thumbprint killing than you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You can’t actually believe I would
do that.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: If our jobs have taught us anything, Tracy,
is that people do strange things. They just want to ask you some
questions.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I will be happy to answer any
questions after we check out this address.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: I have to take you in, Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: This is the answer to the
Thumbprint Killer, Snyder, and this is where I’m going and you’re not
going to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Don’t make me cuff you, Tracy, because I
will if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I believe you would.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: You can count on it.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: It would be nice if you could come
with me, but if you do and it goes bad, they’ll burn your ass. So this
never happened.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That was great! It was fantastic! It was
everything I hoped it would be. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Here comes the gun.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You’re smart enough to figure that out,
Mr. Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Well we’re going sixty five miles an
hour, Mr. Smith, if you shoot me now, there’s a good chance we’ll both
die.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Not now. Take the next off ramp.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: That wouldn’t be very smart of me would
it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Think about this. You pissed yourself
back there, you left your DNA at the scene of a double homicide, and
there’s nothing to indicate that I was ever there. If the Cops do an
analysis of that urine, and they will, you’re the Thumbprint Killer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No. I still have pictures of you doing
the first murder.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes. But what were you doing at the
second murder?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Let me help you with a thought. You say
I forced you to come along and if I’m not here or more specifically my
body is not here to say different, you might have a chance to beat the
rap. Now you’re probably asking yourself why I would help you. I’m
tired, Mr. Smith, I’m tired of killing. But I’m an addict, I can’t quit.
I’ve tried. I can’t do it on my own. So I’ll let you kill me but I want
you to do it smart, in a way that I disappear and my family never knows
what I was.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: How do I do that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: There’s a cemetery I know about. We find
an open grave, you shoot me, I fall in the grave, you shovel in just
enough earth to cover me, tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and I’ve
disappeared. It’s a good plan. What do you say?…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Why should I trust you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You don’t have to trust me. You’re the
man holding the gun, you saw me put mine in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I don’t know. You really want me to kill
you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Okay… But any sudden moves and you’re
dead on the spot and I’ll make sure your family knows what you are.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You’ve come down in the world,
Mr. Baffert.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Uh uh, take your hand out real slow.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: It’s locked. You don’t want to climb
over, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What are you doing with a key to a
cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I own it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Why do you own a cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You always want to invest in things
people can’t do without. Water and cemeteries are pretty safe.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You’ll need this to get out. Now there
should be an open grave around here somewhere. Let’s see if we can find
it.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Meeks?!!</p>
<p><strong>meeks</strong>: Atwood?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>meeks</strong>: Come on down, there’s something I want to
show you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: There we are. Now if I stand here…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … and you stand there, not too far away
and you shoot me, I should fall straight back into the hole.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You don’t think I have the guts to do
this do you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’m hoping you do.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Okay, let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’ll close my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I really did want you to kill me. But in
case at the last minute I changed my mind, I returned to your apartment
and bent the firing pin on your gun.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: In fact I even brought another gun for
you so you could finish me if I had decided to go through with it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Unfortunately for you, my daughter is
pregnant and just before you pulled the trigger, I realized how much I
want to see the end to that story.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: If you do anything to me, if you touch
one hair on my head, the Police will find the pictures of you killing
that Couple.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: The contents of your safety deposit box,
Mr. Smith, have vanished.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Before I was the Thumbprint Killer,
Mr. Smith, I killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It says here the Thumbprint Killer is a
monster… annoys you a little bit that you can’t take credit, doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Anyone who is good at what they do,
wants recognition. But since I’m not going to do it anymore, I’ll let
Mr. Smith take the credit.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Don’t kid yourself, Earl, you’re going to
kill again.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: No, I’m not. I’ll continue the AA
meetings and I’ll control it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: But there is an answer I would like to
have.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Good work, Atwood.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Thanks, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>another officer</strong>: You should ask the FBI to kiss your
ass and buy you a Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I like my ass too much for
that.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: This is bogus. The company doesn’t exist in
the city, the state, the United States or Canada.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: So the whole point of this piece
of paper was to give me Meeks.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: That’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Why? Who moved him, where did they
move him to, and why did he give me Meeks?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: That’s what we get paid to find out.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: I’m going to go to the bathroom
and think about this.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Detective Atwood…</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Why are you a cop?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: You’re rich, you have a good education,
you could have gone into your father’s business, instead you went
outside all of that and became successful on your own. Why?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You want something from me if you
don’t tell me who you are I’m going to hang up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Did you think your husband’s killing was
random and I certainly didn’t have to give you Meeks.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Mr. Baffert?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: What’s the answer?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: You don’t sound like you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I have a little cold. Are you going to
give me the answer?</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: I’ll tell you if you can give me the
true answer to my question.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: My father was very disappointed I
was born a girl and he let me know that. I’ve spent my whole life trying
to prove him wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Wait. You promised to tell me
where you are.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Me? I’m on top of a building.</p>
<p><strong>detective atwood</strong>: Why would he be interested in
that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Agghhh!!! Agghhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Honey, Earl, Earl…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Wake up, wake up…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You were having a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: Oh… I woke you up.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m here, go back to sleep, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brooks</strong>: … that I may be reasonably happy in this
life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen. …. God
grant me the Serenity to accept…</p>
