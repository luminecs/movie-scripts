<p><strong>l o s t i n s p a c e</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>chapter 1</strong>: Earth 2058 ———————</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE
FRAME, a sphere of red desert and fast rushing crimson clouds.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Mars mining base, this is Grissom One,
Request final descent vector.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-mars</strong>: A row of giant red mountains and beneath,
on the planet’s surface, the spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated
landing crosshairs alight a landing pad, beckoning the ship.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Roger, Grissom One, this is Mars Mining,
You are cleared to land. Hope you got some Partagas in that rust bucket,
Sal.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-edge of space</strong>: THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude,
landing thrusters FIRING as the vessel begins to penetrate the
atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I brought you the most amazing…</p>
<p><strong>ext.- mars</strong>: LOW ANGLE from the planet’s surface-.
Two shapes BLAST through FRAME, BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot,
transparent globes, racing up towards the sudden star of the cargo ship
at impossible speed.</p>
<p><strong>int.-bubble fighter</strong>: POV of the burning Cargo Ship,
coming towards us incredibly fast. Speed, trajectory and tactical
readouts flash.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-cargo ship</strong>: The pulse lasers are still
hammering the ravaged hull.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers
locked onto the Cargo Ship, FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The
nuclear core of the Cargo Ship overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in
a storm of fire.</p>
<p><strong>int.-bubble fighter</strong>: A lone FIGURE stands in a
gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up holographic display, command
controls spinning 360 degrees with the pilot’s Comas the fighter SCREAMS
after the fleeing raider.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Sino-Jordanian Raiders. They’re claiming the
cargo ship violated their air-space.</p>
<p><strong>int.-second bubble fighter</strong>: Another pilot commands
an identical craft, ROCKETING towards the assault craft just below
West’s.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: This cold war’s heating up. Where did they come
from?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hell. And we’re going to send them back
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up,
dodging West’s laser BLASTS.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s bubble fighter</strong>: West closes on the
fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack Ship, lasers FIRING in
the b.g., visible through the transparent surface of the bubble glass
under West’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What’s that sound? must be the fat lady
warming up.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: The fleeing Attack Ship loops in
mid-space, reversing direction, heading straight towards West’s Bubble
Fighter. A game of chicken.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s bubble fighter</strong>: West doesn’t flinch.
Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships heading straight for each
other.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s right. Come on, come on, you wanna
play, I wanna play.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: The two ships are ROCKETING towards each
other, locked in collision vectors, lasers FIRING wildly. asdasd</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I can hear her. Oh, yes, oh yes. She’s gonna
sing.</p>
<p><strong>targeting</strong>: DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes,
captured in the targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a
tactical grid.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Target lock.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: Imminent collision.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s fighter</strong>: The hull of the Attack Ship
fills his bubble glass.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The lights are dimming. The curtain’s coming
down. Sing you fat, old bag, sing!</p>
<p><strong>ext.-deep space</strong>: West’s pulse lasers converge on the
Attack Ship barely meters ahead, the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly
before him.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s bubble fighter</strong>: WEST SCREAMS as he
shoots through the sudden conflagration of flame and debris, everywhere
and then gone, giving way to the blackness of space and the starfield
beyond.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Show’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: JEB’S BUBBLE FIGHTER banks, avoiding the
high energy volley. Almost. A laser BURST grazes his Bubble Fighter, the
surface of his craft sparking, suddenly scored with flames.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jeb’s craft</strong>: The Attack ship is right behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: Weapons are off line. Jettisoning main drive
core.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: The thruster core of Jeb’s Bubble
Fighter BLOWS off in a bolus of flame, soaring back into the pursuit
craft. The Raider EXPLODES.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jeb’s craft</strong>: Controls are sparking. Displays
flicker. An ALARM sounds.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Warning. Failure in redundant drive
systems.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Impact on in 90 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: Mars Control. . .</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: Jeb’s ship is barreling toward the
planet.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: . . .this is Ranger One.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: …Engines will not respond. Require assistance.
Repeat…</p>
<p><strong>base</strong>: Ranger One this is Grissom Base. Rescue craft
have been dispatched.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- mars mining colony</strong>: Three small rescue craft
race skyward.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Impact in 60 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s craft</strong>: The rescue craft are speeding
toward Jeb’s fighter below.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Grissom, this is Eagle One. Those Pugs Will
never reach him in time.</p>
<p><strong>base</strong>: Eagle one clear this frequency and return to
base.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This is Eagle One. I’m going after him.</p>
<p><strong>base</strong>: Negative Eagle one, your craft is not
equipped</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: West’s craft dives toward Jeb’s ship and
Mars below.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jeb’s fighter</strong>: Mars is coming up fast.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Impact in 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Jeb, do you have navigational thrusters?</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: Don?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It’s a yes or no question.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: Marginal. But in the green.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Impact in 15 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Head towards the canals.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Saving your ass. Read towards the canals.
Now!</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jeb’s ship</strong>: A tiny directional thruster FIRES,
angling Jeb’s craft so that it scrapes the surface of Mars and dives
into a giant canal, rocky walls rushing up fast.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s ship</strong>: West is accelerating toward
Jeb.</p>
<p><strong>base</strong>: Major West, your ship is not equipped for
rescue. You are not authorized to jeopardize this asset. That is a
direct order. Acknowledge!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Never liked that station, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-martian canal</strong>: Jeb’s tiny craft is plunging
toward the rocky crater floor below.</p>
<p><strong>int.-3eb’s fighter</strong>: The canal floor is rushing up
fast.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Impact in five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s fighter</strong>: Don is blasting toward the
canal floor, almost as if trying to beat Jeb’s ship to a fiery impact
below.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Warning. Proximity alert.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Jeb, I’m going to give you a little kiss.
Don’t take it the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-martian canal</strong>: West angles his ship directly
under Jeb.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jeb’s fighter</strong>: The expanding surface of Mars,
visible beneath his feet, is suddenly obscured by Don’s fighter,
swooping under his ship.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: Don, abort. Abort.</p>
<p><strong>int.-west’s fighter</strong>: Jeb’s fighter is visible
overhead.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-martian canal</strong>: Don’s ship, sandwiched between
the surface of Mars and Jeb’s fighter, angles up and, like a cue ball
hitting it’s target, Knocks Jeb’s ship spinning toward the safety of
space beyond. West’s ship actually scrapes the surface of the planet,
sending up a plume of Martian dust.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: Does this mean we’re going steady?</p>
<p><strong>ext.-martian canal</strong>: West shoots up and out towards
the dark of space.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You weren’t getting out of buying those beers
that easy.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: CHAPTER 2: Mission Objectives
—————————–</p>
<p><strong>vo</strong>: Imagine an end to world hunger. What if ample
food and clean drinking water were the birthright of all our planet’s
children?</p>
<p><strong>vo</strong>: This man, professor John Robinson, inventor of
the faster than light hyperdrive can make that timeless dream a
reality.</p>
<p><strong>vo</strong>: John Robinson and his family have been
extensively trained to take a ten year journey across the galaxy in the
world’s most advanced spacecraft, The Jupiter.</p>
<p><strong>vo</strong>: From a distant world, the Robinsons, Will bring
back a miracle…</p>
<p><strong>vo</strong>: Dimondium can turn even worthless sand to
fertile soil. Earth WILL be a garden. What kind of - future can our
children look forward to?</p>
<p><strong>v0</strong>: A future without hunger. A future without
suffering. Heaven on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>v0</strong>: This mission sponsored by the US Army and the
Coca-Cola corporation.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: WILL ROBINSON hides in a small
space, watching the commercial on a jury-rigged, palm-sized computer. He
mimics the Naylrator.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Coke. Saving the world for our children. Give
me a hi-test break.</p>
<p><strong>int:-living room-afternoon</strong>: Basic twenty first
century modern. MAUREEN ROBINSON stands, talking with a PRINCIPAL who in
less than happy.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: He hacked our main power grid to run his
experiment. The school was in chaos. We didn’t even have lights.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: This is no laughing matter,
Mrs. Robinson. Will is terribly gifted. His little time machines, though
pure fancy, are the products of a truly brilliant mind.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The changing shape of education.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: No more monkey business.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: The boy is starved for attention. Was
there no way his father could have attended the science fair?</p>
<p><strong>ext.-houston - day</strong>: Probably Austin and Dallas too.
Texas has become a giant urban sprawl spreading into Mexico and beyond.
Immense industrial air purifiers hang in a dark, wet sky.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-houston space command-establishing</strong>: A giant
dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline.</p>
<p><strong>int.-space command-mission control-day</strong>: A MAN stands
before a large viewscreen facing the throng of PRESS.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Once we have landed on Alpha Prime our on
board robot will begin construction of a hypergate.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: By then, technicians here on Earth will have
completed a companion hypergate in our planet’s orbit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Once both gates are complete, ships will be
able to pass instantaneously between them. The Jupiter can bring the
Dimondium back to Earth without the ten year delay of a return trip.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Why can’t you just use the Jupiter’s
hyperengine to zap straight to Alpha Prime?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: As you know, hyperspace exists beneath normal
space. If you try to enter hyperspace without a gate</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Your exit vector is random. There’s no telling
where you’d come out.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Professor, how is Captain Daniels
recovering from the flu? Will we still be able to pilot the mission?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, you came to get a
look at the Jupiter One. Don’t you think you’ve waited long enough?</p>
<p><strong>int.-launch dome</strong>: A giant saucer sits connected to
its launch pad by loading belts, steaming fuel tubes and spindled
gantries.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Professor, how does your family feel about
leaving the Earth behind….</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They couldn’t be more excited.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 3</strong>: Goodbye! ——————-</p>
<p><strong>ext.-robinson house-establishing</strong>: A suburban
colonial, the launch dome towering in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: This whole mission sucks!</p>
<p><strong>int.-robinson home hallway-sunset</strong>: PENNY ROBINSON
furious, turns, looks downstairs at Maureen.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I Don’t want to stay home for dinner. I want
to see my friends for the last time.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: … On the eve before she is torn from her
friends, kidnapped, hurled into deep space against her will, what
thoughts fill the mind of the young Space Captive….</p>
<p><strong>int.-will’s room-sunset</strong>: Penny enters a strewn, boy’
a world. Will is trying to select items to place in a single packing
canister marked: PERSONAL CARGO.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri? What will
I wear?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: When we wake up in ten years the video
journals of Penny Robinson, Space Captive, will be devoured by millions.
I will be world famous. You on the other hand, will have been totally
forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: The Space Captive has decided to wear ribbons
of support for fellow sufferers as she is dragged into deep space, green
for the ecological issues, white for human rights</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’d probably gag if I described the
secondary infections loss of circulation can cause.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What are you grinning at?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I just found an upside to this mission. The
thought of jettisoning your body into deep space.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad says Don’t bring them. Like anything I do
matters to him.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: He never showed, huh?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Don’t let him get to you, kiddo. He just gets
busy with work is all.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So, that’s a no to family dinner?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Let’s see, do I spend my last night on Earth
watching Mom and Dad pretend not to be fighting again or get in ten
years of making-out at the mall … you do the math.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mom’s gonna go thermal.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: What’s she gonna do. Ground me?</p>
<p><strong>chapter 4</strong>: Major West ———————</p>
<p><strong>int.-space command-corridor</strong>: John and the General
walk the metal passageway.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re lucky they didn’t press on Daniels,
condition.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I figured a chance to look at the ship
would keep the dogs at bay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ben, I’m worried about jamming in a
replacement pilot at the last second. My family’ a on this mission. I
need someone who’s more than just spit and polish.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I’ve got your man. He just doesn’t know it
yet.</p>
<p><strong>int.-space command- conference room-continuous</strong>: A
figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a
salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: At ease, Major.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Sir, why was I pulled off active duty? I
salvaged my craft and Jeb’s. I’ll fight a court martial, General.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Do you know Professor Robinson?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: By reputation only. Your father’s battle
strategies were required reading at the Academy.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: How much do you know about the Jupiter
Mission, Major?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The Jupiter is fully automated. The pilot
flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on Alpha Prime. It’s a
baby sitting job, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Major, you are aware Earth’s resources are
severely limited.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Every schoolchild knows our recycling
technologies will save the environment. Sending a family across the
galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: What I am about to tell you is classified.
Every schoolchild has been lied to. The recycling technologies have
failed. In less than two decades Earth will be unable to support human
life.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: We spun the ad campaign to give the mission
a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets. We partnered
with Coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have
bankrupted the government. The SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth as
well as we do. They hope to reach Alpha Prime first - And if they do, I
guarantee you, they will not share the Dimondium with Western Demons
like us. our crops will wither. We will be left to die.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: …Captain Daniels doesn’t have the flu, does he
sir?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Daniels was murdered in his apartment last
night. The flu story is a cover we fed the press.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Dan was a good pilot. A good man.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Your rescue stunt over Mars was foolhardy.
Explain yourself, Major.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I had a friend in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You endangered a one billion dollar
spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order because of a friend?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Yes sir. And I’d do it again. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Congratulations Major, you’re the new pilot
of the Jupiter mission.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 5</strong>: Dr. Smith ——————–</p>
<p><strong>ext.-desert-day</strong>: Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands
on a windswept sand dune, talking to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory lane is
required. I was contracted to provide Daniels, apartment code. My work
is done.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: They found a replacement pilot, the
mission is going ahead on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: How tragic. For you.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: We require more direct
intervention.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I see. Well, that will cost you. And, I’m
afraid my price has just become … astronomical.</p>
<p><strong>int.-mission control-medical labs</strong>: The man turns,
revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil. This is DR. ZACHARY
SMITH. He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the portal hiss open. A
TECHNICIAN ENTERS.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Control hasn’t received the results of
your final pre-flight exams, Doctor Smith.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: The Robinsons are checked out at one hundred
percent. They are in perfect condition and ready to fly.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Wish them good luck for me.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 6</strong>: Welcome Aboard! ————————–</p>
<p><strong>int.-space command-walking</strong>: Three small figures walk
through a gantry towards the ship.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: The mission protocols are simple. Professor
Robinson is in command unless you encounter a military emergency. In
that case, Major West, you will assume command.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Welcome aboard, Major.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter bridge - continuous</strong>: Don, John, and the
General ENTER. Don’s eyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: Hi-tech heaven. Two pilots, chairs
face a giant windscreen. Don walks to the consoles that stretch toward
the back walls.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some of this technology might be new to you.
I’ll be happy to explain.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Cold fusion drive Rambler-Krey Life Sciences
stations.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Holographic navigational interface.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Cryosleep array. Fully monitored.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and living
quarters are below decks. Hyperengine should be in here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If you have to baby sit, it’s not such a bad
nursery, wouldn’t you agree, Major?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The cryosleep systems are running at ninety
five percent.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Doctor Smith approved the specs-</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Doctor Smith is base physician. I am
responsible once this ship is in flight. These tubes have to keep the
crew in suspended animation for ten years. They will be perfect or this
ship will not launch. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Absolutely, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Judy, I’d like you to meet Major West. He’s
taking Mike’s place.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s heavier than Mike. We’ll have to
re-calibrate.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’d be more than happy to discuss my
dimensions perhaps over dinner?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: West - I’ve read about you. Something of a
war hero, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Well, yes, actually.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Those who can’t think, fight. Well, nice to
have met you.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s one cold fish I’d love to thaw.</p>

The new pilot-.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: What you had to do was prioritize your
family over the mission</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maureen. This mission is about our family. So
we can stay together</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: The perfect nuclear family. The most stable
social unit, ideally suited for the isolation of a long journey into
space. It’s all just PR, John. You’re never home. Judy is becoming a
ghost just like you. Penny can’t see past her own navel and Will has to
black out-his school, just to get his father’s attention. The perfect
nuclear family in ruin.</p>

<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Alright you two, enough.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: You get a C in paternal expression,
Professor. But an A for effort.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: You always get an A in that.</p>

<p><strong>maureen</strong>: We trusted you. You tried to kill us
all.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Existence offers us nothing if not the
opportunity for an endless series of betrayals. There’s a world behind
the world, Professor Robinson. Lie once, cheat twice and everything
becomes clear. Do not mistake my deception for a character flaw. It is
philosophical choice, a profound understanding of the universe. It is a
way of life.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: You’re a monster.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Perhaps. But I am also the only one who can
save your daughter’s life.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Where’s Will?</p>

tendency to spook the patients.</p>

<p><strong>smith</strong>: You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man could
see that. I hope I have proven the well-being of your family is of great

me…</p>

breathe as long as she does.</p>

the most puzzling definition of a smooth ride.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Judy? Where’s Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Boy either I cut down on the coffee or sew in
a flap. It’s hell getting in and out of this thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you-</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Vitals are normal. Pulse and respiration seem
to be-</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Baby, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m fine Daddy really.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Will every disaster be an excuse for familial
sentiment? Please tell me now so I may gather up a liberal supply of
space sickness bags.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: What happened, John? Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-bridge</strong>: Don in at the navigational

There we go.</p>

more girls?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’ve never seen a design like this. what are
those scales on her hull?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How could Earth launch a ship this massive and
neither of us know about it? … It just doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: These scanners are damaged, I’m getting
inconsistent life signs but they may be sensor ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe her computer’s still up. I’m trying
standard remote access codes.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: The Jupiter Two heads towards the giant
ship.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you give me some light on the secondary

guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder.</p>

<p><strong>john</strong>: Will, you’re the most important thing in the
world to me. I hope one day you’ll be able to see that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Take care of my dad, okay Robot?</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship</strong>: A long dark corridor. Slowly the
ambient lights come up. A door opens to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy
and the Robot, stepping out of the docking chamber, the airlock closing
in the b.g.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The air is stale. Old.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: That’s the smell of ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’m interfacing with the on board computer…
Odd.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not working?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: No, it’s just, I don’t know, too fast. Most of
the systems are down.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Motion sensors are still working.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What do you make of this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some kind of hieroglyphics.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 13</strong>: Exploration ———————–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: If I didn’t know better I’d say this is
blood.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I know an omen when I see one. I suggest a
hasty retreat.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Just imagine we’re retreating in the opposite
direction. Now, move it.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Will watches through the Robot’s
POV, toggling to move the automaton forward. A readout marked AUDIO
flashes. Will turns up a volume control. the sound of a slow, steady
DRIP.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad, do you….</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: … Hear something?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You really need to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That material appears biological.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Nothing good will come of this.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What makes you such an expert?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s find the bridge. Maybe we can get some
answers.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Maureen is at the main sensor
console working an instrument panel.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Try it now, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>int.-ship-walking</strong>: The boarding party stand at the
end of the corridor. Don presses a wall panel. The giant doors hiss open
to REVEAL…</p>
<p><strong>int.-main bridge</strong>: Immense. Empty. And battle torn.
Sections of the controls have been blown away. Blast scoring mars the
walls.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What the hell happened in here?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Some kind of fire fight. Look at this
technology. I’ve seen some of this before. On the drawing boards.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you bring up the Captain’s log?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The data has degraded. I’m going try and
gather any fragments I can. There isn’t much, but … here we go.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Jeb.</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: The hyperspace tracker seems to be functioning…
No sign of the Jupiter Two…</p>
<p><strong>jeb</strong>: Have exceeded our mission timetable by two… I’m
not willing to give up. Don would keep looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s it. The rest of the data is totally
corrupted.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This doesn’t make sense. How could they launch
a rescue mission for us when we’ve only been lost a day?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’ve got something here.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: They brought it up from the planet’s surface.
It’s seems to be some sort of egg sack.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Smith, step away from there.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Happy to oblige, Major. Although I don’t
think it’s me you should be worrying about. But rather this.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Will is at his station, watching
Don and John via the Robot’s POV.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m detecting motion. Behind you…</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship bridge</strong>: A towering SHADOW shoots
past the open doorway.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: After it. Move. Bring Smith.</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship-corridor</strong>: Don races down the
corridor. The walls are matted with flowering plants. Vines twist into a
carpet covering the metallic floor.</p>
<p><strong>int.-hydroponics lab</strong>: A jungle. John and Judy arrive
behind Don.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This explains where all the plants came
from.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Growth like this would take decades.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Unhand me, you mechanical moron.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I am sick of your terrorism. If you are going
to kill me, be done with it. Otherwise I will insist you treat me with
the respect and-</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I said don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Will is watching through the
Robot’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Neat.</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship-hydroponics garden</strong>: West stares down
at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more friendly blue. Judy
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well, who do we have here?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Easy there, little buddy. No one’s going to
hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: How do you know it won’t hurt us?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Looks like you’ve made a friend. You have a
good bedside manner, Major.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’m going to let that one go.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: How charming. Doctor Dolittle of outer
space.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Where do you think it came from?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s possible this is one of the creatures
represented in the hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It must have been
their ship attached to the other docking ring.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It looks like a child.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: If so, my dear Major, what do you suppose
happened to its parents?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s get back to the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 14</strong>: Giant Spiders! ————————–</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Penny is still hanging
overhead.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I think I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: That’s strange.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Those scales are giving off heat.</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship-bridge</strong>: John is at the Com.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve tapped into the internal sensor array.
Besides us, this ship is totally deserted.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: A ghost ship.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: And the flavor of the day is … banana/beef.
Who thinks up these combinations?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: MM. Good.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Major West, I highly recommend you never
breed. That by the way is my medical opinion.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Little thing was hungry.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Good Lord, who will - spare us the tyranny of
the sentimental?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Do you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Get this infernal creature off me.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This can’t be good.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: You have a remarkably keen sense of the
obvious.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Maureen stands with Penny at the
main sensor station.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: John, get the hell out of there.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-probe ship</strong>: Heads and legs emerging, the disks
reveal themselves to be armor plated spiders. The monsters find viscous
holes in the outer hull and push through, vanishing into the probe
ship.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as
if struck.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Give me an external view.</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship-bridge</strong>: The lizard monkey’s
SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A shape begins to push
through the viscous bole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Evacuate. Now!</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship-tunnels</strong>: The boarding party race
down the corridor. The spiders are bounding after them, using walls,
floor, and ceiling with equal facility.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Will is madly working his
keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This joy stick is too slow. Activate
holographic interface.</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship</strong>: The Robot is holding up the rear,
its torso swiveled backwards so it can retreat and FIRE
simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: They eat their wounded.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>int. -jupiter two</strong>: WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes
within the holograph.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Turn left.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Now right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Got to seal the bulkhead.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The door control is at the other and of the
corridor.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The fire sensor.</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship-docking bay</strong>: Don activates the
airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Open, damn you.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It’s cycling a vacuum check. There is no way
to speed up the protocols.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Fools. I warned you not to come aboard this
cursed craft. You’ve killed us. You’ve killed us all.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now that’s a bedside manner.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Maureen and Penny are at the Com,
powering up the engines. Will is within the holograph, fighting off the
spiders.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Charge.</p>
<p><strong>int.-probe ship-docking bay</strong>: The Robot’s shell
electrifies, the spiders recoiling.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will, get the Robot in here.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Will is throwing off the monsters,
Extending the Robot’s antenna spikes and scanner dishes to skewer
spiders that are squeezing by.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I can’t move him without letting the spiders
into the ship.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Leave him behind.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m sorry, Robot.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-docking bay</strong>: A spider pushes past
the Robot, head slipping around his metallic body, bent on reaching the
airlock and the crew within.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Seal it. Now!</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: The inner airlock door Opens. The
crew tumble in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get us out of here.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Get this cloying gargoyle off of me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get me an external view.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Prepare to disengage.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Get it off me. Get it off.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Initiating separation.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: It’s okay. Everything’s going to be
alright.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: We’re clear. Everybody hang on.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: The Jupiter Two’s engines BLOW,
peeling into the endless night.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: ALARMS sound.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I think those things were using the probe ship
as a way to trap food.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That I s probably what happened to the
monkey’s parents. We were going to be desert.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: But what happened to the crew?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing good.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: We’re not out of the woods yet.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Let’s see how these monsters like a hundred
thousand volts.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two</strong>: The hull glows with electricity.
The spiders fly off into space, their limbs and heads retracting.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: And the crowd goes wild.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Recall your nightmares from childhood, Major.
Monsters are rarely so easily dissuaded.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Persistent bastards.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you hit them again?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Every time I electrify the hull, I’m draining
our systems. Once or twice more and we’re going to be dead in space.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: A fate I fear may be inevitable one way or
another.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s the same expression you had when my
mother came to stay with us.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: DNA extrapolation - coming up. Silicone
based. Admantium shell and lack of respiratory system suggest an ability
to live in deep space. Tiny front brain implies communal relationships.
More like bees.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: There are thousands of those things</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: They may be attracted to heat and
light.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: With the right command codes, I can light up
the probe ship from here.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Damn. No response.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Command codes are sequenced. Try the next
series.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: But they won’t work until the next fleet of
ships are built. That’s at least two years away.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Think about it, Don. The ships’s advanced
technology. Your friend looking old. What if that ship is from our
future?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Warning. Outer hull has been
compromised.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: It’s not working.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you get the fusion drive on line?</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: THE PROBE SHIP’S fusion drives FIRE. A
few of the spiders divert back toward the probe ship. But most still
head for the Jupiter.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Let’s turn up the heat.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: The Jupiter Two banks toward the probe
ship, heading directly for the wake of the fusion drives.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Warning. Inner hull breach in twenty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give them a little encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Electrifying outer hull … now.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two</strong>: The outer bull flashes with
electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don pilots the craft directly
through the wake of the fusion drive.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: ON SCREEN the giant spiral of
spiders in now heading back towards the giant probe ship.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get us out of here. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Never leave an enemy stronghold intact. One of
your father’s first rules of engagement.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don, stop. That’s a direct order. We might
need to salvage-</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This is a military emergency. That means I’m
in command.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don, no. I’m ordering you-</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I hate spiders.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy ride.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-space</strong>: The probe ship’s nuclear core overloads.
The engines begin to glow, venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a
nascent star.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: The ship is buffeted by the shock
wave.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I can’t hold her.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two</strong>: The ship is knocked into the
atmosphere of the giant planet below.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Don is struggling to keep
control.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: We’re going down.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two</strong>: The ship is hurling toward the
planet’s cloud obscured surface.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: The windscreen is filled with a
RUSHING BLIZZARD.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Can’t get the stabilizers on line.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Pull up. Pull up.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Really? No kidding? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>giant snow covered mountain range.</strong>: Don banks the
controls.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two</strong>: The ship tilts on its side,
passing between two snowy peaks, still plunging towards the planet’s
wintry surface below.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’m reading a clearing ahead. I’m going to try
and make it.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-planet’s surface</strong>: The Jupiter Two BLOWS over a
carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of leaves bursting into flames from
the friction of the hull.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: The surface is coming up fast.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Got to slow us down.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-planet’s surface</strong>: The Jupiter Two hits the surf
ace of the water and skips, once twice, three times across the alien
sea.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Brace for impact!</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two</strong>: Still. Automatic fire systems
spray gas everywhere. only the dimmest emergency lights cast any
glow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Everybody, by the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Life Sciences, still breathing.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Mission medical, I’m alive.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Me too. Robotics, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Video Mechanics, okay.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I’m alive, Major West’s poor excuse for
piloting skills not withstanding.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: Before them lies the crater, snow
covered floor spreading out towards a distant horizon stained red by two
hanging crimson suns.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 15</strong>: Follow Orders! ————————–</p>
<p><strong>ext. -alien landscape-night</strong>: The moonless sky is
filled with an utterly alien starfield. The Jupiter Two sits near the
wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting the otherworldly
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You violated a direct order.</p>
<p><strong>int.-engine room</strong>: Cavernous. John and Don stand by
the giant drive engines. Don is holding a cylinder containing a mixture
of power chips, some glowing with radioactive fire, others dull and
charred as coal.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: About half the core material is burned out.
We’ll never generate enough power to break orbit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I told you not to blow that ship’s reactors
and you did it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Come on, Professor, give it a rest. I was
technically still in command.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t hand me that. I’m commander of this
mission.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Look, no offense, but you’re an egghead with
an honorary rank. No one ever intended you to handle combat situations.
You’re spouting some nonsense about- time travel while those spiders
posed a continuing threat. I made a judgement call and if I have to I’ll
make it again. Hell, you of all people should understand that. If your
father were here-</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My father is not here. My father is dead,
killed in one of his combat missions you so admire. My family is on this
ship And you’re going to follow my orders. Whether you agree with them
or not. Is that clear, Major?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Save the speeches. I like you. But the fate of
the Earth is at stake here. I’m going to do whatever I think it takes to
ensure the success of this mission. With or without your help. Is that
clear, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Am I interrupting something?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: No. Really. I think you two should go ahead
and slug it out. I mean, here we are stranded on an alien world and you
boys want to get into a pissing contest. So please, go for it. I’ll have
Judy down here in a heartbeat to declare you both unfit and I’ll take
over this mission. Now I don’t want to hear another word from you two
until you can play nice. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>john west</strong>: Maureen- Listen-</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Not another word. Better. Now if you’ve
finished hosing down the decks with testosterone, I suggest you come
with me. I may have found a way to get us off this planet.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 18</strong>: Danger Will! ————————</p>
<p><strong>int:-will’s cabin</strong>: Will sits working over his
hacker’s deck. STATIC.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Can you hear me? Robot?</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Systems error. Robot unable to register
neural net outputs. Unable to locate motor controls. Unable-</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Calm down. Your body was destroyed in the
conflict with the space spiders. Do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But I downloaded your neural net.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Robot tried to destroy the Robinson family.
Why would Will Robinson save Robot’s personality? Your actions do not
compute.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I guess sometimes friendship means acting with
your heart, not your head.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Logic error. Friendship does not compute.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Don’t worry, Robot. Im going to build you a
new body. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mom always said I should try to make new
friends.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 15</strong>: Follow Orders! return to CHAPTER
————————–</p>
<p><strong>int.-bridge</strong>: Maureen stands at her life sciences
station with John and Don.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: The atmosphere here can sustain human life.
I’ve located 500 Rads radioactive material a mile north.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s at least what we’d need to get the core
functioning again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll set off at daybreak. it’ll be safer.
Those are my orders, Major.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I agree with your recommendation,
Professor.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: D�tente is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p><strong>int.-sick bay</strong>: Judy examines the lizard monkey.
Penny strokes the tiny creature, producing a string of BLIPS.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: What’s the diagnosis, Doc? Is it cowboy or
ballerina on Halloween?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Right now she’s a girl. But I think your
little pal here is from a self-replicating species. At different stages
of life she, or he, probably alternates sexes.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Imagine the savings on dating outfits
alone.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Can I keep her?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Penny, you’ve never taken care of a thing in
your life besides yourself.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Please. She’s all alone. I promise I’ll look
after her. She needs me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: …The moment you misplace her, or forget to
feed her, we leave her on this planet where she can live in the wild.
I’m not kidding Penny.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: We’re both a long way from home, aren’t we
little one?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s what we’ll call you. Blip.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You like that?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Judy stands, just out of sight,
watching her sister, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 16</strong>: Alien World ———————–</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-med lab</strong>: Don shoves an indignant
Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed security panel in the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Remove that lock this instant. I shall not be
caged like some animal</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I gave my word I’d let you live. I never said
for how long.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: These quarters will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Tell me, Major West. Are you really confident
in Robinson’s ability to guide us? If I were set free, I would support
your right to command. With minimal force, we could take this ship and
assure this mission continues under your leadership.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: …My God Smith, you’re right. How could I have
been so blind? I’ll just run and get you a gun so we can hijack the
ship. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak mind.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’m hiding the pain. Really.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I assure you, Major West. Your pain has just
begun.</p>
<p><strong>int. -bridge-night</strong>: Judy sits in one of the command
chairs over a the remains of a meal, sipping water, staring out into the
alien night.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Star light, star bright…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: A million strange stars and only one wish. I
wish we were home.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I never thought a sky could look so alien. …We
really are lost.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: When the first sailors circled the globe and
saw a brand new sky, they thought they had sailed off the edge of the
earth. But they were really just around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We just billow our sails and let the wind blow
us home, Is that it Major?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: So those sailors found familiar shapes in the
stars to make the skies more friendly, to help them find their way.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s how constellations were born.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Porky the wise and mighty Pig.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The great bucktoothed Bunny… Bugs.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: So, my quarters or yours?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: We are the only single man and woman of
consenting age in the galaxy. How much more of a set up do you need?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So you figure just dispense with the
pleasantries, get down to business?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You have a way with words, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Right here? On this console?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Here would be fine.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Next time, fly slower.</p>
<p><strong>int.-john &amp; maureen’s quarters</strong>: Maureen sits on
the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John activates the automated
security systems.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What was I thinking, bringing us all out here
into space?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: The world needed saving. You were the right
man for the job.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But solving the world’s problems doesn’t leave
much time for the people you love, does it?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Did you get any time with Will?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now he’s decided he can rebuild the robot.
Wants to show me his designs. I’ve got too much to do-</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Funny creatures, men. You try so hard not
to be your fathers, end up making the same mistakes. Will adores you. He
needs your attention.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We can’t get off this planet much less back on
course. I don’t have time to…</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: John, just listen to him. it doesn’t matter
what he’s saying. Just listen. Sometimes, at least in the eyes of their
fathers, little boys have to come first.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: As soon as we get back into space, we’re going
to spend some real time together. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: It’s nice to have our family under one
roof. Even if we had to go half way across the galaxy to manage it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How would you feel about a little late night
tutorial, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Mm. That’s new. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Going for extra credit.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two-night</strong>: The ship sits on the alien
landscape.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Good night John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good night Maureen.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good night Judy.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Good night Will.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Good night Penny.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You guys have got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 17</strong>: The Core ——————–</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-bridge-morning</strong>: Will comes up on
the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the morning. He stumbles
to the viewscreen.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh man.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: A giant portal shimmers at snow’s
edge about 100 yards from the ship. Beyond it, a sun-stained field of
towering plants and trees.</p>
<p><strong>int.-briefing room</strong>: The crew gathers at the table. a
RUMBLING. The ship shakes.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: What are those rumblings? They’ve been
happening all morning.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How can half the landscape have grown up
overnight?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, let’s get settled. Maureen?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: It’s impossible. But this planet’s
geothermic plates don’t match up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was afraid of this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think these tremors are the result of
opening and closing doorways.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Doorways to where?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The future.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Perhaps the Professor was hit on the head
when we landed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Remember the portal that lead us to the probe
ship? What if we crossed a into a time years after Earth sent a rescue
mission.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You’re not serious? Time travel is
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No it’s not. It’s just improbable. Like
hyperdrive was a hundred years ago. Nothing’s really impossible.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This world could be riddled with doorways to
the future.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So if we walk into that forest outside, we’re
really just walking into this crater years from now.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Geological plates from different times
wouldn’t fit together. That would explain the tectonic mismatch. But
doorways in time, John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If these portals are opening and closing, part
of some cascading, natural phenomenon, they could be tearing this planet
apart</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: These portals are exactly what I predicted my
time machine would do. What if the doorways aren’t natural? A machine
that bends space, like our hyperdrive, could be modified to bend time as
well. What if someone on this world has built a device?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Son, I appreciate your input but now isn’t the
time for flights of fancy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You never listen to me. Not ever.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s no telling how long before this planet
breaks up entirely.</p>
<p><strong>int. -bridge</strong>: John, suited up, heads for the open
front hatch when he spots Will sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering
with his deck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aren’t you coming out to say goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re always leaving. What if…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What if one time you don’t come home…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whenever your grandfather went away on a
mission, held leave these with me. For safe keeping. And when he got
home I d always be waiting to give them back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m coming back Will. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two</strong>: The Robinsons, all except Will,
stand-gathered around the front of the ship. Don has a small tracking
device in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’ve got a fix on the radioactive material.
It’s through the portal.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll just have to hope the doorways remain
stable.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: These crater walls are disabling the
com-links. You won’t be able to communicate with the ship.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I love you, wife.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m going to regret saying this, But try to
get back in one piece.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This is kind of a kiss for luck occasion,
wouldn’t you agree, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: See. I’m regretting it already. Kisses have to
be earned. Say goodbye, Blip.</p>
<p><strong>blip</strong>: Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You take care of her, Penny. Take care of you
too, baby.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Smith stares out the cabin
window. PUSH IN as</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Yes, enjoy your moments of trite familial
bonding.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Because they will be your last.</p>
<p><strong>int.-will’s cabin</strong>: The beginnings of Will’s
home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in the f.g. riffling his
PERSONAL CARGO container.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s everything even close to nonessential.
Even my bellybutton ring.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks, Pen.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You want to come on a land survey?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Look, what does dad know? Maybe someone did
build a time machine.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Robot is on line.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It sounds like old morse code.</p>
<p><strong>int.-corridor</strong>: Will walks down the corridor. The
KNOCKING continues. Will follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of
Smith’s prison.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Danger.</p>
<p><strong>int.-smith’s cell</strong>: The door slides open and Will
ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You said someone is in danger.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: We all are. You are wise to arm yourself.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This gun is set to fire for me only so don’t
try anything funny.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: William, you misjudge me. I only want to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Help us? You tried to kill us all.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: But now our fates are intertwined. if your
father and that idiot West fail, I will have no chance of getting home.
It is in my best interests they succeed. And I always follow my best
interests.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: What monsters roam these alien wilds? Fools.
To set off blindly across this savage land. Much as I hate to admit it,
it will be harder to manage without them.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What are you talking about? They’ll be back.
They’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Someone should go after them.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Will, I forbid it. You’re a boy. A clever
one, certainly, but a child nonetheless. This planet is likely full of
predators. Even if you found them, what if they’re hurt, ravaged, dying,
what good could you do?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But you’re a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-jupiter two-day</strong>: Judy and Maureen are hanging
on repelling lines before the crater wall, shipping away ore that
glitters like diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Not really. Geologists have speculated that
Dimondium might be naturally occurring in many older worlds. Part of a
biosphere’s way of rejuvenating itself.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: This one is ten times more powerful then that
on Alpha Prime. There’s enough here to save Earth.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: After much deliberation, the Space Captive
has decided to accept her new role as member of the crew. The Robinsons,
after all, can obviously use her help…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Now look what you’ve done. Stop hanging all
over me.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Blip. Wait. I’m sorry. Damn.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 19</strong>: A Different Future ——————————</p>
<p><strong>ext.-planet’s surface-day</strong>: Will and Smith are
walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation tracker in his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ve got a fix on Dad’s suit beacon.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wow, that’s Mom’s favorite color.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: How droll.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Run, child, run.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Will? Will?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: William, wait!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: See, over here I’m in the future. Here I’m in
the past. Don’t worry. If my theories are correct, these doorways should
remain stable, for a while anyway.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I can barely contain my glee. Why aren’t you
aging like the plants?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s just an effect of the portals forming.
Once they stabilize you can cross from one time to another just like
stepping between two rooms. Dad’s signal is this way. Come on, Doctor
Smith.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Come, come, son, no time for distractions.
Let’s move on.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-planet’s surface-day-pres</strong>: John and Don emerge
from the brush. They have come to one of the crater walls. John looks
from the rock face to his tracker.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Damn? Damn is not good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The radiation signature we’ve been tracking.
it’s a ghost. A reflection from the Jupiter Two bouncing off the ore in
these walls. There’s no core material here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The ship’s back that way. we have to go
through.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-brush-day-present</strong>: Penny is pushing through the
forest.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Blip? I’m sorry. Blip?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Blip, wait.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-crater caves-future</strong>: Penny pushes through
dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs and caverns cut into the
crater wall.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Blip, you can’t run off like that. What
the-?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Some kind of fight, in space. It almost looks
like the probe ship Major West blew up.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That could be the Jupiter Two crash
landing.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Blip, no!</p>
<p><strong>giant blip</strong>: Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-planet’s surface-evening-future</strong>: Don and John
are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more desolate,
desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We should be able to see the ship.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Could these be from the probe?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Corroded. This metal is decades old.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What kind of nightmare is this? Where the hell
are we?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, Major, when the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: Rolling out from behind him, claws
extended in attack Position and apparently many years old, is a rebuilt
Robot.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-planet’s surface-evening-future</strong>: Will and Smith
are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given way to desert. The
suns hang low in the crimson sky.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I feel like we got turned around.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Just follow your father’s signal, young
William.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: A boy of your intelligence shouldn’t
swear.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Oh. Shit, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: JOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two bridge-future</strong>: Or what is left of
it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers Shattered monitors. An
awful history-told in torn metal. John is slumped in a corner, Don still
on the floor beside him.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, well. All things really do come to he
who waits.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Why Professor, the shock must have scrambled
your brain. Look around you. Don’t you recognize the spot? You’ve come
home.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This can’t be…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What have you done to the ship. …Where’s my
family?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Your family is dead. Dead and in the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: What fickle consort in memory. Time dims
certain images while others shine clear and bright as yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: I’ll never forget that morning. Twenty years
ago. What was it you said? I’ll be back. I promise. But I knew better.
You never came home.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Without you, your family never had a chance.
A few spidersv survived the destruction of the probe ship. They reached
the planet and attacked. I can still hear the women scream.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Don’t you recognize me, Dad? It’s me. I’m
your son. Will.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-crater caves-day</strong>: Maureen and Judy, lasers
drawn, are pushing through the brush.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Penny? Penny?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Penny? Baby, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: It’s okay, Mom. They’re not going to hurt us.
it’s like they think I’m their princess or something.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-crater caves -evening-fliture</strong>: Judy is
examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes the
images graven into the giant stone.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Best as I can tell this whole clan was spawned
by this single creature. We’ve been a busy girl haven’t we? But…</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Speak, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Each creature seems to have unique corpuscular
patterns on their palms. As individual an fingerprints, no two alike.
Except…</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Except the prints on this giant creature
and our little Blip match exactly. Don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Because, I think Blip and our friend here
are actually one and the same.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-engine room-future</strong>: The Robot,
shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other, follows Older
Will into the giant room.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Father, I give you … eternity.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava
bursts through the floor above which floats a giant ball of silvery
liquid held suspended by the pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils
of fire strain towards the bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver
liquid, images form within the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: . . .ouch. Who ordered me that last drink?
What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think we crossed into our own future. We’ve
come back to the Jupiter Two decades after we left.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Look father, what my flights of fancy
have wrought. I used your hypergate to build my time machine.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Over the years I have struggled in vain
to harness the awesome power of time. All my experiments at creating a
stable doorway have been futile. Until now. Today you will witness my
ultimate triumph.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The core material. if we could get that back
to our Jupiter Two…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The doorways in time that led us here must be
a side effect of his machine coming on line. Like streams running into
the ocean….</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Once this core material in fully
introduced into the control console, I will open a doorway stable enough
for one person to take one trip through time and space as well. Today, I
will change history.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: I will return home, to the very day you
took us on this cursed mission. I’ll stop us from taking off. I’ll do
what you never could. I’ll save the family. I’ll save us all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look around. Your machine is ripping this
planet wave you ride home has the same effect on Earth? What if, in
getting home, you destroy Earth in the process?</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: I’m going home. I’m going to save the
family.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will, I’m your father. You’ve got to listen to
me-.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Let me tell you about my father. My
father was a walking ghost. Never there when I needed him. He dragged
his family into deep dark space and lost them there. My father is not
coming to the rescue.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 20</strong>: Spiders Sting ————————-</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’ve got to go inside.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Slow down, now. We can’t know what waits
inside that ravaged craft. But we can be confidant it is nothing good.
And I for one am frightened.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But Dad’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Will, listen to me. I have crossed this world
with you, found your father as promised. But I can’t let you go in there
unarmed.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But I’ve got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: If we go forward, the barer of that weapon
must be ready to kill. Murder is a skill, one which I have developed
and, luckily dear boy, you have not. Look inside your heart, Will. Are
you truly capable of taking a life? If not, then I ask you now, put your
faith in me. Give me your trust. Give me that gun.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Enable gun for all users.</p>
<p><strong>gun</strong>: Voiceprint confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: A brief lesson in survival on this world or
any other. Never trust anyone. Remember it into your old age, should you
have one. Now move!</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-engine room-future</strong>: John stands
facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the control panel
and the descending core material.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We can go back across the portals to the past,
to the functioning Jupiter Two, where your mother and sisters are still
alive. We can use this core material to escape together.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: And then what? All of us lost in space.
Don’t you see? I can do what you never could. I can save us all.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Never fear. Smith is here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will, I. . .</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Don’t move, Professor Robinson or this rather
peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief. I’ll ask you to step
away from that console, Major.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Well, well, some of us just don’t know when
to stay dead.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I borrowed this from the probe ship in hopes
of taking over the helm once we were in flight. But I seem to have found
a better use instead.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Let’s try this dance again. You are the
puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do get it right this time.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Robot, enable electric disrupters.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Now that’s a good gargantuan.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Say goodbye to your past. You’re future lies
with me. I’m going home in your place.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You did it. Just like I imagined. Re-routed
the hypercore. But the natural power source, the delivery system. I
never thought of those.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: You will. The future is never what it
looks like when you’re ten.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Heartwarming. Nauseatingly sentimental but
heartwarming.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: We certainly could have aged better, I must
say Now, show me how your little time machine works.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: An odd moment for mirth, don’t you think?
What are you grinning at?</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Look around you, Doctor. At this hostile
world. Do you really think a boy could have survived all alone?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Never fear, Smith is here.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me
again after all these years.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: The spider’s sting had some unexpected
side effects.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: But my unique gifts gave me an
advantage in this quarrelsome world.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: After the women were savaged, I became
the father Will never had.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition
fills me with self-loathing. You see I have looked within me and what I
see is you.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: I never liked me, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Kill them all.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: But my dear boy, once the doorway in
time stabilizes, this planet is going to come apart at the seams.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: I am willing to perish here on this
world for the sake of your most noble mission. But your selfish father
will only try to stop you.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Once your mission is complete, none of
this will have happened anyway. So why not just dispose of them?</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Very well. Robot, take them inside the
ship and keep them there. If they move, then kill them.</p>
<p><strong>ect.-crater caves-future</strong>: Maureen and Judy are
examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground shakes. Birds SCREAM.
RUMBLING.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: We’ve got to get to the ship. Penny?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Where is she, girl?</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-engine room-future</strong>: The pulse laser
is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in the bubble
stabilizing. The TREMORS are increasing in frequency.</p>
<p><strong>pan down</strong>: Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as
the Robot shepherds the crew towards the body of the ship.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Well, it would seem the time is upon
us. Off we go, William.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will, it’s a trick. Smith’s carrying an egg
sack. If he’s willing to stay on this world and die, why is he about to
spawn? He’s going through the portal himself.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>on the rising control platform.</strong>: OLDER WILL-CLOSE.
Frowns.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.</p>
<p><strong>ext.-gantry system-wide shot</strong>: The platform bearing
Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins moving out across the
bridge towards the crows-nest.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two-engine room control
platform-future</strong>: Spider Smith drops into place beside Older
Will as the control platform comes to a stop on the crow’s-nest.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: It’s almost time. I really am a
word-smith.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Once the core cylinder is fully
injected, the planet will begin to come apart and the time doorway will
stabilize. Then I jump in.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: A leap of faith. How fitting.</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Tell me again, old monster, how did the
girls die?</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: We’ve been over this before, son. The
spiders attacked the ship</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: In all the years since, the spiders have
never re-surfaced. Why?</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Let’s forget the past.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Focusing the aperture. Remember, the
energy around the portal will rip a man to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Isn’t the doorway too small?</p>
<p><strong>older will</strong>: Not for me. But then I’m not going, am
I? The spiders didn’t kill the girls. It was you. I just never let
myself see it. You kept me alive because you needed me. Because I could
build this for you. You killed my family. Destroyed this world. And I
helped. You became mad as the spiders. …And I became you.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Poor, poor boy. Did you really think I
would let you go home? Let all that I have become vanish? Look at me. I
am no mere man. I am a God.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: Your father was right. Within me roil
the growing needs of a master race. We WILL descend upon helpless Earth.
An entire planet to rule.</p>
<p><strong>spider smith</strong>: An entire planet on which to feed.</p>
<p><strong>int.-modified jupiter two-future</strong>: John and Don talk
in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. the TREMORS are increasing
in frequency.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’ll run, draw his fire. You may have time to
get away with Will.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Halt or Robot will destroy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do you remember what I taught you. A long time
ago. About friendship?</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Friendship means acting with your heart not
your head.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s why I rebuilt you. Because I wanted us
to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Logic error. Friendship does not compute.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Forget logic. Act with your heart.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Robot has no heart. Robot is powered by a
fusion pulse generator</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Every living thing has a heart.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Any attempts to override command protocols
may result in fused processors in my neural net.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Please, Robot, if you don’t let us go, we’re
all going to die. I’m asking you now, will you help us? Will you be my
friend?</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Robot attempting to deactivate control
bolt-commands overriddenattempting to reroute-dangercircuitry
overloadattempting to escape-kill them, kill them…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You did it.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Robot will save … I will save Will Robinson.
I will save my friend.</p>
<p><strong>chapter 21</strong>: Time to Die! ————————</p>
<p><strong>ext.-forest-day-present</strong>: Penny and Maureen chase a
frantic Blip through the portal back into the daylight of the present.
Here, too, the world RUMBLES.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Penny? Penny?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Where did you go?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I came through the forest. I had a promise I
had to keep.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Inside. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>int.-jupiter two bridge-future</strong>: Don, John, Will and
the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the ground RUMBLES.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’ve got find your way back to the ship. The
portals may still be stable. I’ll try to meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m going to get that core material. It’s our
only chance to escape.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’ll stay. The family needs their father</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The crew needs their pilot. No matter what
happens, when the planet starts to break up you take off.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Without the core we’ll never have enough power
to make orbit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’ve got to try. Promise me, Don.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Good luck. Commander.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will. Son. I want you to know-</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’ll tell me when you get back to the ship.
Now there just isn’t time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I could use a weapon.</p>
