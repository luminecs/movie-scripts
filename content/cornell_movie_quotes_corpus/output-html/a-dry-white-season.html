<h1 id="a-dry-white-season">a-dry-white-season</h1>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This was your best race.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: I beat him, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You did son. Come on, shower.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll be expecting you. There isn’t much to do,
only weeding the marigolds and watering the lawn and flowers.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We’ll be there, Mr. Ben’sir, Jonathan come
to help me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And how’s the algebra? Still giving you
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Just a little, Mr. Ben’sir.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He’s working hard, Mr. Ben’sir, and your
money will not be wasted. Emily and me will always thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: See you both later.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: U ya phi?</p>
<p><strong>ext. soweto beer hall - afternoon</strong>: The beer hall is
a large complex with a drinking area with long rows of low benches.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Men sit drinking African beer in
one-half and one gallon plastics containers. The place buzzes with
noise. Several people are touting wares for sale. Suddenly a group of
about twenty youths walks into the drinking area, obviously to cause
trouble. The LEADER starts to address the clients.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Your children are starving and you are
drinking. We demand freedom and our fathers are drunk. We ask you to
boycott these beer halls. Revolution and drink don’t work together!</p>
<p><strong>man with sideburns</strong>: Since when do children talk like
this to their fathers? They need thrashing.</p>
<p><strong>int. soweto police station - charge office -
afternoon</strong>: The charge office is sparcely furnished with a long
bench along a wall. There is a reception counter with Sgt: Van Zyl in
charge. The boys are lined up against a wall. The sergeant stands with a
tall blond man with a scar on his chin, CAPTAIN STOLZ.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The sergeant reads out a name and looks
at Stolz; if he nods the boy stands aside. After this ritual, the ones
that Stolz has chosen are marched to a waiting police van and driven
away. The others are taken to the cells at the police station, these
include Jonathan and Wellington.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dutch reform church - day</strong>: The MUSIC STOPS. The
doors open. The 40 years-old- minister Bester comes to the door, then
stands and greets his parishioners as they file out of the church.
Amongst them, Ben Du Toit – his wife, SUSAN, a clean- cut, immaculate,
“toe-the-line” beauty and his son, Johan – the blond, blue-eyed, tanned
and torsoed fourteen- year-old every father dreams of. Susan greets
friends and acquaintances, pausing to chat… mostly formalities. Johan,
his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her father, Mr. Cloete, the
headmaster – she smiles at Johan from a distance; he waves awkwardly as
she drives off with her parents. SUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated –
groomed. She takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car,
carries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her husband. She
shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting, concerned, to a WOMAN. She looks
drawn and worried.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. coetzee</strong>: He won’t come to church. He lies in
bed all day, listening to his headphones.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wondered why he wasn’t at school. Would it
help if I came to see him? He’s always seemed a good kid to me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. coetzee</strong>: Oh, would you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course. I’ll phone and we can fix a
time.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben! Ben!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She rocks it back and forth, holding it
at arm’s length. The BABY SCREAMS. The nanny comes forward – Suzette
hands it over.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mrs. Coetzee. She looked worried.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: She’s having trouble with her boy. He won’t
come to school.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: So you said you’d have a word with him?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>ext. ben’s house - barbecue - day</strong>: The Du Toit
family.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gordon! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s kitchen - day</strong>: Six cuts, like six knife
gashes, revealed on the blood- stained buttocks of Gordon’s son, who
stands in painful, truculent embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s not why I’m complaining, Mister Ben,
sir. If he did wrong, I’d beat him myself. But he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He did nothing and they wouldn’t listen.
They wouldn’t believe him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry, Gordon. But there must be a
reason.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He says he wasn’t doing anything wrong,
Mister Ben, sir. And I believe him, I know my son! It’s an
injustice!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What about the court? Didn’t he state his
case?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What does he know about court? Before he
knew, it was all over.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t think there is anything we can do about
it now.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We can get a lawyer to appeal.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A lawyer? That won’t heal Jonathan’s
buttocks.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You don’t understand, Mister Ben, sir. I
don’t want him to have a police record.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: It will be there for the rest of his life
and make it difficult for him to get a job in the future.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t worry, Gordon. I’m sure there’ll be no
record, it’s such a minor case. Please don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Johan, get some iodine from the cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m not worried about the wounds. They’ll
heal in time, Mister Ben, sir. It’s the wounds here. I worry about.
Injustice… it festers.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Rub it on the wounds and it will help.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ben’s gate - day</strong>: Ben watches the black man and
his son trudge down the long drive, the father’s arm on the son’s
shouldre. At the foot of the drive the nose of an exotic Soweto cab can
be seen waiting… a large butterfly painted on the hood.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ben’s garden - day</strong>: Ben takes his place at the
table. Susan brings a piece of boerwors and a mug of beer.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Trouble?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jonathan has been caned, by the police.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He probably deserved it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. soweto school - soweto uprising - morning</strong>:
School grounds of the Orlando Secondary School. Students are milling
around in high spirits. One group is putting finishing touches to a
banner reading: “no to aparhteid education.” There are two other banners
being carried around the school yard, followed by the younger children.
They read: A BOY, one of the eldest, aged about 18 years calls for
silence. The STUDENTS immediately obey.</p>
<p><strong>student leader</strong>: You all know why we are going to
march.</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: ‘No to Bantu education’ ‘No to apartheid’
‘Freedom Now’…</p>
<p><strong>student leader</strong>: There must be discipline. We start
marching from here and we’ll join up with the others at the main road.
Please take care of the younger ones. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Examples: “EQUAL EDUCATION NOW”</p>
<p><strong>“no to the afrikaans language”</strong>: There are chants of
slogans as they march:</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: ‘If we learn Afrikaans vorster must learn
Zulu.’ ‘Bantu education! Stinks! Stinks! Stinks!’ ‘Equal education! Now!
Now! Now!’</p>
<p><strong>further up street</strong>: Three police Jeeps block the
route of the march. A little distance behind are police troops carriers
. About six police-dog-handlers in camouflage uniforms stand across the
road waiting for the march to approach.</p>
<p><strong>commandant</strong>: Now listen to me, this is an illegal
demonstration. I order you to disperse immediately.</p>
<p><strong>commandant</strong>: This is the last warning. Disperse
immediately or I will take action.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wellington! Wellington!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Shoot me! Come on, shoot me! Shoot me!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She slumps to the ground crying.</p>
<p><strong>int. soweto train carriage - late afternoon</strong>: The
third-class carriage is crowded with African commuters returning to
Soweto. The passengers represent all the social and economic strata of
Soweto: laborers, factory workers, domestic servants, clerk secretaries,
the unemployed, etc. In the carriage, Gordon, returning from work,
standing.</p>
<p><strong>large woman</strong>: Careful with your bag. Can’t you see
where it’s touching?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Can I see where it’s touching?</p>
<p><strong>large woman</strong>: Men of today only like looking.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: It’s the electricity.</p>
<p><strong>man in khaki uniform</strong>: What has electricity to do
with it?</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Today with the electricity they say:
‘Darling let’s not switch off the light.’</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: I hope you have electricity with those
thick glasses of yours. With your eyes you couldn’t find anything.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: Tell us, does your wife also wear thick
glasses?</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: You should know, she’s your sister.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: There is more laughter.</p>
<p><strong>man in blue overalls</strong>: Quiet! Thulani! Thulani!</p>
<p><strong>man in blue overalls</strong>: They are killing our children
and you are making jokes…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They say hundreds of children have died and
Soweto is burning.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - gordon and woman</strong>: talking about the
information.</p>
<p><strong>smartly-dressed man</strong>: The white people, they will
pay, and soon.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: ‘They will pay, they will pay.’ Since
when have they been killing us, putting us in jails, starving our
children to death, taking our land? Hundreds of years. And what have you
men done? Only talk, talk, talk. You are not men. Sis.</p>
<p><strong>int. gordon’s house - evening</strong>: Silence.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Are you sure it was Jonathan they took
away?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes, baba, with Wellington.</p>
<p><strong>int. soweto police station - day</strong>: Black parents,
waiting. At the counter with Gordon, a large black man, STANLEY, a
friend – his big easy smile is working hard on a white policeman, the
station SERGEANT VAN ZYL, about to run out of patience.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No, no, I understand, Baas, but is that all
the names? There’s no other list somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant van zyl</strong>: I’m telling you. He’s not in
custody. Have you tried the hospital? Have you tried the mortuary?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant van zyl</strong>: I’m only suggesting the
possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: But, what about John Voster Square?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant van zyl</strong>: Look, I’ve tried to help you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re here too, sis Paulina, who are you
looking for?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They picked up my girl – 13-year- old
girl!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: We are all searching.</p>
<p><strong>int. baragwanath mortuary - day</strong>: A white-uniformed
assistant leads a line of African parents, reeking of sadness, into a
cool room where metal drawers open from the walls. Stanley and JULIUS
their black lawyer – the two men seem to be very well-known, people
shake hands with them, salute them –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The crowd parts to let them through.
Other women reach out to touch her.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mortuary - day</strong>: Gordon, Emily and their friends
cross to Stanley’s great white elderly Dodge, this “etembalami” with the
big butter- fly. For, amongst other things, he is the owner and driver
of a pirate taxi. They get in. Stanley pauses – looks across at a small
red VW Beetle parked nearby, waiting. He shakes his head – the VW
flashes its lights and drives off.</p>
<p><strong>int. stanley’s taxi - day</strong>: Inside they sit in
silence… recovering from the ordeal. Only Emily silently whispers “Thank
God, thank God.” After a while…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He is our son… we must find him.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’ll make more inquiries – John Vorster
Square – the special branch – but I don’t hold out much hope.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You’re a lawyer, Julius!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A black lawyer! Those Boers… the
bastards’ll kick him around till they lose him.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: What about the Baas? If he asks, they will
give him an answer.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: When the boy was flogged he didn’t help. Why
should he help him now?</p>
<p><strong>ext. ben’s garden - morning</strong>: Gordon is at work
already – 8 AM – mowing the lawn. He’s intense, unsmiling, burdened as
he goes about his task, expertly. Sounds of BEN and JOHAN LAUGHING
coming from inside.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ben’s garden</strong>: Ben adjusts the sash of his robe
and takes the offensive towards Johan, as he sees Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Hi, Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hold it, champ.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gordon, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Isn’t this Jonathan’s day to help you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How is he, recovering?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I don’t know, Mister Ben, sir – the police
took him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: They arrested many. They even deny they’ve
got him. He’s disappeared…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Disappeared? He’s a child – why didn’t you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay! I’ll see what I can find out.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s study - morning</strong>: Ben is talking on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Our gardener, yes. Probably nothing, but he’s
worried.</p>
<p><strong>int. lawyer’s office - day</strong>: Sumptuous lawyer’s
offices, Johannesburg. They’re lush- carpeted. A black woman cleaner is
finishing off her early-morning chores, packing up as white staff are
be- ginning to arrive. They’re fresh, shining, attractive – whipping the
covers off typewriters. A young black girl, smart, well-groomed, is
carrying a tray of coffee, desk to desk. FOLLOW her as she approaches
her employer’s open office door.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: … And when was this?</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: Ngubene – Jonathan Ngubene.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: I’ll get on to them straight away… Not at
all – I think better this time of morning – after lunch, man, I’m a
zombie. Sure – let you know straight away – love to, Susan… Cheers!
Freda! Open an account… Du Toit. Benjamin Du Toit… Subject… Jonathan
Ngubene.</p>
<p><strong>typewriter</strong>: – CHATTERING out – on Lewinson’s headed
note paper:</p>
<p><strong>hospital</strong>: Young black nurse carrying bedding –
corridor – startled by moaning, screaming figure of black boy, being
hustled on trolley into private ward. Boy is deposited on bed as
policeman is posted outside.</p>
<p><strong>2nd police typewriter</strong>: – Second heading:</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: confronted by Gordon and Emily. She shakes
her head vigorously, denying all knowledge, shows them the door.</p>
<p><strong>finally:</strong>: Dear Sirs, With reference to your enquiry
seeking the whereabouts of Jonathan Ngubene, we are sorry to inform you
we have no record of anyone of that name…</p>
<p><strong>superintendent</strong>: It’s preposterous. I would have
known – of such a case… I mean… in my hospital. You people! You’re
always raking up trouble!</p>
<p><strong>int. lewinson’s office - day</strong>: He is with a client.
He pushes a button on the intercom.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: … Freda – I said no calls… Oh… Right… put
them through. Hallo! Yes! How are you?… that is correct.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: Very well. Thank you for finally letting
us know.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>int. dan pienaar school - staff room - day</strong>: Tea
break for the teachers, Ben among them. He is enjoy- ing a laugh with
his colleagues – maybe in Afrikaans – we should hear the language here
where we need not com- prehend. An African serves the tea. There’s a
KNOCK – a monitor comes in and talks to Ben who follows him outside.</p>
<p><strong>int. school - day</strong>: Ben at the phone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello, Dan… No… it’s all right…</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: I’m sorry. They have just officially
informed me. The boy was never in detention. He died … the day of the
riots and as nobody came to claim the corpse he was buried a month
ago.</p>
<p><strong>int. school - day</strong>: Ben at the phone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thanks a lot, Dan… I’ll tell Gordon. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dan pienaar school - playing fields - day</strong>: The
playing fields, not of Eton but as good as…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Mister Ben, sir. If it was me, all right.
And if it was Emily, all right. We are not young. But he’s out child. My
time and your time, it’s passing. But the time of our children is
coming. And now if they kill our children – if we let them – what is it
that we lived for?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gordon’s shoulder –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That day, Mr. Ben, sir, when they whipped
Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing. But if we had… if someone
heard what we had to say this would not have happened.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s a terrible thing, Gordon – God knows I’m
sorry. But you have other children to live for… I’ll help them too with
their schooling.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: How did he die, Mister Ben, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I told you, Gordon… He died on the day of the
riots.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s what they say. But I got to know for
certain. How can I have peace? I must know how my son died and where
they buried him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gordon. The police – if they’ve said…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I don’t care what they say. He is my child.
God is my witness today: I cannot stop before I know what happened and
where he lies. His body belongs to Emily and me.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: … This business of Gordon’s son. Be careful,
Ben. These are not normal times – one has to make allowances.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t worry! I’m no crusader. I’ve known Gordon
a long time, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: I understand – it’s your Christian duty to
your neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Something like that – yes.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Just don’t get too close. Teachers must stay
out of politics. Love to Susan!</p>
<p><strong>ext. ngubene house - late afternoon</strong>: Emily is
watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard, with a bucket and a pierced
tin. Robert is playing nearby with the youngest child. Robert sees
Gordon walking slowly to their house and says playfully to the baby:</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Look who’s coming? It’s baba!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Oh, no… oh no, Lord.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Please don’t tell me…</p>
<p><strong>ext. soweto main road - day</strong>: Stanley and Gordon are
driving along Soweto main road.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Baba, I heard you’re looking for Wellington.
He’s out, Baba.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Where is he? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: He’s with some boys at Dube’s shop.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thank you very much. You’ve worked like a
man. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dube’s shop - day</strong>: Wellington and a few pals
are standing outside the shop – they greet Stanley as they see the car –
Stanley shouts back greeting.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Take it easy, boys. Hey Wellington!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What happened… Don’t tell me…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Did they do that to you?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Wellington has a nervous arm-twitch… and
nods to the question.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I want to know what happened to
Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>wellington</strong>: Isn’t he out yet? I last saw him weeks
ago.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Jonathan is dead.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I have to know how he died.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s dining room</strong>: Sizette and Chris with the
family at dinner. Suzette is passed the Rand Daily Mail newspaper by
Chris, folded at an article headlined: “WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO JONATHAN
NGUBENE?” by Melanie Bruwer.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Isn’t that tragic? Jonathan was such a nice
boy. Even played with my Johan when they were small, God.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And he was such a nice boy, well- mannered.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You said he was very bright at school.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Well, this kind of journalism doesn’t help
the situation. Look at her face? What does she look like?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The Rand Daily Mail always exaggerates.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She passes the paper to Ben. He looks at
Melanie’s pic- ture: she looks 30 years old, long black hair, large dark
eyes with a fierce, unsettling, uncompromising stare, a small nose and a
generous and sensual mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Looks quite attractive to me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: article; then with</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What does she expect? They’re out of control.
Give then an inch and they take a hundred miles. It’s in their nature.
The only language they understand is force.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Chris, Jonathan was fifteen, like me. Would
you use force on me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re not a terrorist. If you were – like an
increasing number of them, you’d deserve it. Look, every time you pick
up the newspaper…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My God, one hundred shot! They didn’t have to
kill them.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This bloody Bruwer woman reports one hundred
shot, but the radio said only twenty and the police were attacked
first.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: I thought the idea was to give them their
own areas, banstustans. Let them live with their own kind. No chance of
conflict then. Everybody’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: And who would do the work?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: The work, who’d do it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You for a start. Come on! Help me clear these
dishes.</p>
<p><strong>int. gordon’s house - night</strong>: The small dark room is
crowded. The one oil lamp – on the table – At the table sits Gordon… his
glasses on the end of his nose. Emily is sitting by the stove. Robert
stands beside her chair, watching, listening. The youngsters are
sleeping in opposite directions on the iron bed.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘On the second day of our detention at John
Vorster Square we were taken to one of the top floors. We were ordered
to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks. This for
a long time.’</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘On one day me and Jonathan…’</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘… We were asked questions for the whole day
and night by Capt. Stolz and different policemen – they never stopped.
They tried to force us to say we were the leaders at our school, that we
were working for the A.N.C. and got money from overseas. Capt. Stolz
wanted to know the names of the students committee and where he can find
Toni Mtimkulu – Everytime they asked question, they beat us. It was bad
beating.’</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘We told them we had done nothing and didn’t
know about all the things they are asking us; on two occasion they put a
wet bag over my head and I – couldn’t breathe – I thought I was going to
die. One day I heard Jonathan being beaten. He was screaming and crying,
and then a noise like tables and chairs being knocked down, and
Capt. Stolz shouting “you bastard, get up, do you hear me?” Ngubene,
don’t pretend here, get up.” Then the next day I heard he had gone to
hospital and I never saw him again.’</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant venter</strong>: Stay right where you are.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: On your feet! So, you must be Gordon
Ngubene?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: We know each other, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Gert, in daardie kammer. Jaimie, in die
ander.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant venter</strong>: Niks, Kaptein.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Take the bastards away.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Emily sits motionless, anger in her
face. She can hear the sound of the CARS DRIVING AWAY.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That day, Mister Ben, sir, when they whipped
Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing. God as my witness today: I
must know what happened and where he lies. His body belongs to Emily and
me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jeezus – Jeezus – Jeezus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Good night, Papa!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Johan is entering, knocking on the
half-open door. He’s in his pajamas and dressing gown, ready for bed.
Ben looks up at him. Johan kisses his father who suddenly clasp his son
hard, clinging to him for dear life. The boy throws his arms around his
dad’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Oh, Papa!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Coffee! Come on, Johan. Time for bed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, son. Go and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m proud of you, Ben… what you’ve done for
that family. But darling, you shouldn’t take these things to heart so
much. What more can you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know. I’m just tired, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Come, come to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I will, in a minute. I’ll just put the thoughts
of Standar Six away. They mustn’t be lost to posterity.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She chuckles, satisfied, leaving
him.</p>
<p><strong>office voice</strong>: ‘… Seeking the whereabouts of a
certain Jonathan Ngubene, regret to inform you we have no record of
anyone of that name…’</p>
<p><strong>int. classroom - day</strong>: Afrikaan boys in uniform
hunching over their desks writing… On the blackboard: the date and
history test:</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right, time up! Hand in your test.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ben smiles and Cloete goes into the
office.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s happened, Emily?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I’m sorry, Baas… but it’s Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dan pienaar school - day</strong>: … Stanley is waiting
in his car. His sunglasses on his nose… … The SCHOOL BELL RINGS to give
the end of the tea inter- val. Ben walks out with Emily to Stanley’s
car. Stanley gets out, they stare at each other. Finally Stanley breaks
the silence.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How’s it? I’m Stanley! I heard about
you!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: This is Stanley Makhaya… He helps us all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t worry too much, Emily, I’m sure Gordon
will be home in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>int. interrogation room - john vorster square - day</strong>:
Gordon stands facing the wall, his arm raised. He has wetted his
trousers.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Come on, Kaffir, talk!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Please, I’ve done nothing. All I tried to do
was to find…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant venter</strong>: Up with those bloody arms!</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: We don’t like gramophone records here! Now
who has been giving you informations?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant venter</strong>: Why don’t you answer the Captain,
han?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Johannes! The bag!</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stolz is supervising.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Somebody will meet you on second
floor.</p>
<p><strong>int. interrogation room - day</strong>: Gordon’s still
sitting on the chair, slumped – Johannes removes the handcuffs as the
Lieutenant removes the wet bag. Gordon is breathing heavily and
semi-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Come on you bloody black bastard. Who has
been telling you lies?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: I’ll be down immediately, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>int. viljoen’s office - day</strong>: Behind the large desk,
Colonel VILJEON replaces the tele- phone receiver; there is a KNOCK on
the door – and a young policeman ushers in Ben. Colonel Viljoen stands
and ex- tends a hand.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Come in, Mr. Du Toit, come in. How do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nice to meet you, Colonel Viljoen.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: I used to watch you play for the Transvaal.
You were one of the great wing forwards.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Captain Stolz, Mr. Du Toit.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Do sit down.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: All right now, Gordon Ngubene.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well… to put it simply, Colonel…</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: I’m always grateful for that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I thought there might have been some kind of
misunderstanding I could help straighten out.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know him, Colonel. He works at my school.
He’s done work for me too.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: And you feel you know him enough to vouch
for him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, after so many years… 10 years. Gordon’s
not the type to get himself in trouble. He’s an honest, hard-working,
church- going man.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Ha! You’d be surprised how many honest,
decent, church-going men we come across during a working day.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: It’s routine, Mr. Du Toit – a routine
enquiry. Cleaning up these townships we must leave no stone
unturned.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I appreciate that – but Gordon would never…</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Not an easy task either – the press
screaming blue murder – especially the English.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: And they’ll be the first to squeal if the
Reds took over, make no mistake. Rushing back overseas clutching their
bloody British passports. Have you any idea what will happen here if we
don’t follow every lead? We have a duty – obligation. You have your job
– we have ours.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Colonel – believe me, I’m with you all the way.
But in this case – I’m sure that in your worthy pursuit of the guilty
you have, unwittingly, involved the innocent. After all, we’re all
human. We all make mistakes sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: We are indeed, Mr. Du Toit – we are indeed.
Though there’s many who might need persuading as to that fact.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Mr. Du Toit. While you’re here, would you
mind if I asked you a few questions about Ngubene?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Colonel, I’d welcome it.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Shall we start with his son?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: The eldest.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. He died some time ago.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: What do you know about Gordon’s activities
since Jonathan’s death?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nothing, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Did Gordon ever discuss the death with
you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course he did – he was upset.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: But he accepted the truth?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He is a religious man… in the end he would have
resigned himself to it.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Would have? You mean he didn’t? Was he
angry? Rebellious?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come on, Colonel! If one of your kids died… …
and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is buried,
wouldn’t you be upset?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: We told him how his son died, Mr. Du
Toit.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ben turns back, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: You have a son, Mr. Du Toit?</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Does he burn and destroy – everything he
can lay his hands on?… No – and neither does mine. That’s what I can’t
understand… after everything the government does for them. Think about
it, Mr. Du Toit. We’re for you, not against you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve never doubted it, Colonel. It’s you who
appear to be doubting me. These questions. You’re making me feel like a
criminal.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Du Toit… I’m sorry. It’s
force of habit. Once a policeman, always a policeman, eh?</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: … As soon as we’re satisfied he’s innocent,
he will be released. We know what we’re doing, Mr. Du Toit. You want
your wife and that boy of yours to sleep safe tonight, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ben nods, smiles, makes for the door,
turns.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: One last favor, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Fire away!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gordon’s wife – she’s very worried. May she
bring him some food and a change of clothes while he’s still here?</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: No problem! Thank you for your help…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you. I’ll rely on you, then.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Will you find your way out?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think so. And thanks. I feel much happier
now.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Good! And give my regards to your
father-in-law – tell him we’ll have a drink sometime – maybe go to a
game.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I will. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Is the little bird singing yet?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jon vorster square</strong>: Ben opening his car. Johan
is sitting in the front seat. As Ben gets into the car, he glances at
the John Vorster Square building.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I talked to them. Gordon will be released soon.
The colonel was very understanding.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Did you see Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Did they say anything about Jonathan?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, but… Johan, he is dead. We can’t do
anything for him. Don’t mention this visit to your mother. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>int. du toit kitchen - night</strong>: Suzette and Susan in
the kitchen arranging the dessert tray. The kitchen is surprisingly
neat. LAUGHTER is coming from the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: What extra-mural interest?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Champion of political detainees!</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Is that right, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s right, Suzette. But, only one detainee:
‘Gordon!’</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Our Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: My God. What on earth for?</p>
<p><strong>int. du toit house - dining room - night</strong>: Susan
reaches VIVIERS and the minister DOMINEE BESTER, with their dessert
plates. The candles have burned down amid the detritus of dinner:
glasses disarranged and dirty, the cloth spotted with food and wine and
ashes. In addition to Viviers, dateless, and Bester and his wife, the
school’s headmaster, Cloete and his wife.</p>
<p><strong>int. du toit house - kitchen - night</strong>: Ben hastily
uncorking a bottle of wine while talking to Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: It must be a mistake, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course it is. I went down there, told them.
They’re looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Went down where?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: John Vorster Square.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: You old devil you. Does Ma know?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. And you’re not going to tell her.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A pause. She looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Be careful. I don’t want my favorite Papa
in trouble, Gordon or no Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: More wine? Viviers?</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: Not for me, Oom Ben. I’m drunk enough.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Cloete?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cloete</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cloete</strong>: Oh, I saw those sheets you liked,
Sally, on sale at Bloom’s.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bester</strong>: Will you be free on Wednesday
afternoon? I have one or two other things to buy.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Who are you? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, it’s you… hum… Stanley, isn’t it? That’s
all right, darling.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: A Friday night, man! I’m no doctor, I’m
not on standby all the bloody time. Can’t they wait ’til Monday?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Dan! I’m standing here with Gordon’s clothing
in my hand. It’s bloodstained…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There are broken teeth in the pocket. Monday
may be too late! The lawyer has been banned.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: Do you mean Julius Nqakula? Too bad, he’s
a good lawyer. Why are you getting so involved, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m just trying to help Gordon. … You
represented many cases, tell me, does this happen often? But Gordon’s
not political. Okay, Dan, I’m sorry for disturbing your weekend.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He agrees to see you tomorrow and will apply to
the supreme court for an interdict to stop any assaults on Gordon. And,
we’ll find out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re all right, Lanie.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Thank you, Baas.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Come on, sisi. Tomorrow it’ll all be
first-class again.</p>
<p><strong>int. du toit lounge - night</strong>: Laughter again. Ben has
rejoined the party in the lounge. The women are together talking,
laughing and the men on their own.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: More coffee, anyone?</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: The security police don’t arrest people for
nothing, Ben. Leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They could make a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Blacks lead double lives. One you see and
one you don’t. These people surprise you all the time.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: That’s what I like about them.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re not concerned with ‘blacks.’ We’re
talking about GORDON. A good man and very loyal.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: And a hard worker too.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: A hard worker? I had to get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: I fired him a few days before he was
arrested for staying away from work for days. And for the sake of the
school I say good riddance.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean ‘good riddance’?</p>
<p>****: 49.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: I have a responsibility for the children.
These are troubled times, Ben, we can’t trust the natives any more.</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: You have to be extra careful about any
influences, Oom Ben. Even their churches are breeding grounds for all
sorts of evil ideas.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gordon’s not subversive and definitely not a
Communist.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Then he’s got nothing to worry about!</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: Except his three teeth. Our government
mustn’t allow such things to happen. After all, it’s a Christian
government. What do you say, Dominee?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not talking about the government! I believe
in our government, damn it…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … Look, I know the police often know more than
we do. I’m not questioning that. I’m as loyal as the next man. But I do
know Gordon Ngubene… there is something wrong.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Anything else, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ben starts pouring, and offers the first
glass to Bester.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Dominee?</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Nee Dankie.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: Oom, Ben, may your problems be small
ones!</p>
<p><strong>int. interrogation room - day</strong>: Gordon is undoing his
trousers. Venter roughly drops the trousers and pushing him to the
floor. He handcuffs him while Johannes pulls off the trousers and
underpants, and manacles his ankles. Johannes fetches a rod. Venter goes
to a cupboard, pulls out two electric wires with electrodes attachments
and places them on the desk. All the preparation is done with practiced
efficiency. From the adjoining room there are angry shouts of a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>captain stolz</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>captain stolz</strong>: Johnannes, the table.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant venter</strong>: You’re a heavy shitface. Too much
mealie porridge!</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: How do you feel today? Ready to fly?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Yes, Mister Ngubene, we know about this
Wellington… and… … We know about him… and him … Now, we want the names
of the others. And today you’re going to tell us.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Bloody woman. Water!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant venter</strong>: ‘Samson’ is ready, Captain, shall
I switch him on?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Okay. Gert!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hai!</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: That was a small taste of ‘Samson.’ We have a
whole day…</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: … Kom!</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: A letter for you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: What are you bloody-well waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: No reply, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Now about these affidavits who told you to
collect them? The A.N.C.? Who recruited you?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I don’t know anything about the</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: You’ve had your chance. Now you’re going to
shit.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Reg gert.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hai! Hai! Hai!</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: God created the whole human race so that
they could occupy the entire earth. He decreed how long each nation
should flourish, and what the boundaries of each territory should be.
Our task is to preserve that creative diversity.</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Brothers and sisters, like our forebears,
the Voortrekkers, who trekked into the wilderness preserve the
Afrikanere way of life given to them by God. Today, we also live in
times of great danger. Let not fear overcome you! Cling to the ways of
justice and truth preserved by our leaders. So shall God be honored…</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: … So shall the Afrikaner people
flourish.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s garage - day</strong>: Ben’s garage/workshop – the
door is open. Ben and Johan are together building a strong desk for
Johan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me you’d been down to
John Vorster Square?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What difference would it have made?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m your wife, damn it!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t want to upset you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Upset me? It upsets me when you share your
bloody secrets with a child!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben! Ben! Look at me for God sakes! Johan uit
met jou!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We have a good life. We may not have
everything we might have had if…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … If I’d been more ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben, what’s happening? Sometimes it seems to
me I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s happening – it’s something I’ve never
had to face – deal with – before.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He’s the gardener for God’s sake, not one of
the family.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Be patient with me… When Gordon is free you’ll
have me all to yourself again… promise.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben. We’re growing old.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nonsense. One’s as old as he feels. I feel
young and very attractive. I can still do my duty.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Papa.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: _______________________________</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Stanley’s here, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh, bloody hell!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Susan exclaims in angry frustration and
flees.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Gordon’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The bastards say he committed suicide…
hanged himself.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Suicide… is that what they told Emily – poor
woman…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They didn’t tell her. She heard it on the
radio like the rest of us. I contacted Lewinson immediately. He then
rung the police to ask why Emily wasn’t informed. Would you believe it,
they said they were sorry, and they didn’t know where to contact
her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: God! I never thought Gordon could commit
suicide.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Did you understand me? I said, they said he
committed suicide.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How do we know?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Gordon wasn’t a coward.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What do you mean ‘but’? What about Timol
who they said had jumped from a top-floor window? What about Ngudle?
What about Mosala? Joyi? Malele? They all died in that John Vorster
Square. All suicide, eh?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Anything I can do to help?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He’s got brothers.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Brothers?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m his brother, man, we all are! We’ll
take care of everything. That’s the African way.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stanley, I’d like to see Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Don’t look for trouble, man. You know there
are riots all over Soweto. You’re out of it. Why don’t you stay out?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t you understand? I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You got to go? Of course, Lanie… the last
farewell. But we have to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>int. stanley’s car - day</strong>: Stanley drives sportingly
as he talks to Ben, seated in the back.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: We expected it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How can you talk like that!?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A guy gets picked up by the S.B… he’s part
of history, man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean you had no hope, you didn’t believe
he’d be released?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hope’s a white word, Lanie… It’s not hope
we need.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, thank God Emily has you to lean on,
Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Emily is like my sister… We go back many
years.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you belong to the xhosa tribe too?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I am an African. That’s all! Comprende?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I am an African too!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was fourteen before I wore shoes – except for
church… I grew up on a plaas miles from any town… watching sheep
and…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Bullshit! Next you’ll have me believing we
grew up in the same country, same laws, same freedom, same
everything!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He laughs.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: We are now about to leave the white jungle
and entering the land of love and glory.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So this is Soweto.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Land of love and glory, Lanie! But watch
out for the police and army. They’re patrolling all the time.</p>
<p><strong>ext. funeral parlor - day</strong>: A group of young children
playing under the blinding sun in a muddy ditch, notice the big painted
butterfly on the hood of Stanley’s car. They wave and scream at Stanley
in their language and he screams back at them.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hurry up, Lanie.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s pov</strong>: A modern funeral parlor with its name
painted on the side:</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Stanley notices the two little girls
with dusty smiling faces, standing there waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No sweets today. I’m sorry, babies.</p>
<p><strong>children’s pov</strong>: On the doorstep of the funeral
parlor: Stanley and Ben run into a young woman coming out with a
shoulder bag and a camera. The young woman and Stanley exchange a quick,
friendly greeting – it’s MELANIE BRUWER, the Rand Daily reporter – and
keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>int. funeral parlor - day</strong>: Ben and Stanley follow
the proprietor who is expensively- dressed in a dark suit. Gordon’s
coffin stands as one of many in the room. Inside the casket, brass
fittings, white satin, lies Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black
Sunday suit. His hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a bird
and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left side distorted,
blackish purple.</p>
<p>****: 61.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: ‘The living close the eyes of the dead. The
dead open the eyes of the living.’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please, take me to Emily.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Look, we’d took one hell of a chance to get
here, let’s not push it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I really have to see her, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: through rearview</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They drive in silence… then:</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What are your thoughts now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Come on. I know you came to see the body.
What do you think now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I… I cannot think. I’m confused.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You either believe what you saw or maybe
you still prefer the government version.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: For Christ sake, just get off my back,
Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Okay. It was a simple question.</p>
<p><strong>ext. white suburb street - late afternoon</strong>: The big
brassy Dodge is threading its way through the leafy calm of the white
suburb.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know, Lanie, when you run a taxi,
especially a pirate taxi like me, you have eyes and ears everywhere.
Even when a policeman farts in his bed you know. People want a reference
book, a permit to stay in Soweto, a house, anything, we taxi drivers
know the routes. I’ll tell you something…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Dr. Hassiem has been picked up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Dr. Hassiem is the doctor we got to
represent Emily at Gordon’s autopsy. We wanted the truth.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He would have testified. Bloody hell!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A smart move by your Boer brothers. They
have silenced Hassiem.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: His report has to be important. We can only use
what we have. Therefore, Lewinson must get a very good advocate. If only
we could get hold of this Hassiem’s report.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s the use? It’s one big game and we
blacks are merely spectators. Hey Lanie, can one be a spectator as he’s
being kicked around?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not a question of being spectators. The
courts are impartial, the law is what matters.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s what you all say. I have to move
man. Your neighbors! Now, be careful. They will put their marks on
you!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’ll find out! In case you need me. Don’t
give your name – just say ‘Lanie’ phoned – right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now tomorrow at ten…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sharp! At our smart liberal friend’s
office, yeh!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I went to Soweto and saw Gordon’s body. They
have lied to me, my own people – they killed him! I saw the body.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Johan looks horrified.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben, you’re not a doctor. His death was
announced officially. They wouldn’t say anything unless they were
certain of their facts.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Facts? There’s a doctor who participated at the
autopsy. A Doctor Hassiem and he…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You mean the Indian doctor who’s been
arrested?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: It was in the five o’clock news, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s him, he represented Emily at the
autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben, I’m sorry about Gordon’s death, but
please for all our sakes, forget about this whole thing. Let’s get back
to a normal life.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can I have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: A brandy?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You always know what I need.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please, Ben, I’m frightened.</p>
<p><strong>ext. soweto cemetery - morning</strong>: The large Soweto
cemetery has scores of graves ready for burials. The chief mourners,
Emily, Robert, his sister, Margaret, four relatives and Stanley are
standing on either side of the PRIEST. Gordon’s coffin is in the grave;
several wreaths are on the side of the grave.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Before I conclude, I have to say we are
tired of making this journey every day, sometimes twice in one day,
burying our children, and those, like our departed brother, Ngubene who
were merely seeking the truth; and those who have been denounced by
traitors amongst us; and those who have been brutally killed for no
reason, yes I shall say it, by the police. Let those who rule this land
of ours listen to the word of God; let them listen to our peaceful and
just demands; let them be humble and go down on their knees and seek
forgiveness, then listen to God.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: We will have a few words from Mr. Pilani our
father and leader.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER threads his way
through the crowd, a loud hailer in his hand. As he reaches the grave he
turns. The crowd is quiet. He says something to the Priest then
addresses the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>senior officer</strong>: The funeral is over. I order
everyone to go home. This is not a political rally. I repeat,
disperse.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s lounge - night</strong>: Ben, Susan watching the
main evening news bulletin on TV. On the screen a sequence of
rioting.</p>
<p><strong>commentary</strong>: Despite repeated warnings young blacks
attacked the police with rocks and petrol bombs. Five policemen were
injured.</p>
<p><strong>commentary</strong>: Several arrests were made. One youth was
killed and five wounded.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: This morning there was a serious
disturbance at the funeral of Gordon Ngubene.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: The detainee who committed suicide by
hanging himself at John Vorster Square. An overseas television cameraman
broke an arm during the disturbance. It’s been reported that several
people had been killed by a car-bomb in Belfast Northern Island…</p>
<p><strong>ext. johannesburg - street - afternoon</strong>: Stanley and
Ben are driving in the outskirts of Johannesburg.</p>
<p><strong>ext. approaches of soweto - afternoon</strong>: Stanley
drives seemingly alone at very high speeds, which he maintains through
the streets of Soweto… using his horn to scatter people out of his way,
to the anger and indulgence of others.</p>
<p><strong>int. emily’s house - afternoon</strong>: Ben stands awkwardly
for a moment, taking in the room and the people in it. He then walks
over to Emily who is standing at the table. He goes to shake her
hand.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How are you, Emily?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Well, thank you, Mr. Ben, sir. Eh, that’s
father Masonwane, our priest, and that’s Margaret from next door.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Mfundisi… … Sisi!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Please sit down. Take this chair, the other
one is broken.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t mean to disturb you. I’ve come to talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Yes, it’s good. What I want to know is why
did they kill him. He didn’t do them nothing. You know, Mr. Ben, sir, I
washed his whole body for he was my husband. And I know a man who killed
himself, he doesn’t look like that.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Master, you must understand she’s still
raw inside.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Robert, where are you manners today? Don’t
you greet visitors?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I’m sorry for his rudeness.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You have to understand what’s happening to
our children today, they’re like wasps when you burn their nest.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That’s right. Our children are saying
‘that’s enough!’ Things have to change in this country. They accuse us
of being cowards.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Emily, I have really come to assure you that I
will do all I can to help you find out what really happened to Jonathan
and your husband – we cannot bring them back to life, but we can make
sure that this sort of thing won’t ever happen again.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You mean well, sir, but it’s better to
forgive. If we keep the pain alive then hate and bitterness will remain
with us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The air must be cleared. So we can breathe
again.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The air can only be cleared if we forget
about yesterday’s thunder.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Mr. Ben is right. It’s not that I want to go
on with this thing because it’s a bad thing that Jonathan died, that
Gordon died that’s hard enough to bear, but I can forgive it. But they
covered Gordon’s name with dirt and we must clean it up, else he’ll
never have peace in his grave.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You must understand for us, suicide is a
coward’s way out, how do they say, it’s a ‘cop out.’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gordon wasn’t a coward and we’ll prove that. We
have a very good advocate for the inquest. His name is De Villiers. I
have confidence in him and the truth will come out.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: The truth must be known. They killed my
husband who wouldn’t hurt a fly and they killed Jonathan who was only a
child…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Those people who did it are sinful people
who don’t know what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He! Mfundisi, what are you saying now? You
mean…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: We must help them. That’s the only way. They
need our help, not hate, but love.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I pity them and I ask the Lord to help me so
I can learn to love them.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: If that’s what you preach in your church
you will soon be starving.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: They covered his name with dirt.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Aren’t you afraid sis Emily?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: No. In the end one grows tired of being
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Amen!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Emily, Stanley and I will do all we can. As I
said we have a good advocate. Everyone involved with Gordon’s death will
be questioned and all that’s known regarding what happened in John
Vorster Square will come out.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: How can anything come out of that John
Vorster Square? Who there will say: ‘Yes, we killed the boy and
Gordon?’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Lawyers ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And don’t policemen lie?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Ben, sir for what you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m pleased I came.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Wait, let me check the situation.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Take it easy. It’s okey, dokey, but
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do I…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes, on the floor man.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Okay. Kids, time to go home. Be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Sure ‘bra’ Stanley. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. outskirts of soweto - late afternoon</strong>: Stanley
is driving, they have left Soweto. Ben still on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are we still in Soweto?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why don’t you look for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What the hell are you playing at?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Precautions, Lanie.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t call me Lanie! What does that mean
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You will not understand, Lanie.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s bedroom - night</strong>: Susan and Ben are in
bed. Susan is in Ben’s arms, she is relaxed and loving.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think I am without awareness. I have always
cared about people, call it a social conscience. But my visit to
Gordon’s house made me experience another dimension of human
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The poverty, ja…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I expected that. But listening to them talk
made me realize that I did not know the blacks. Now I question my
attitudes, my concerns as Ben, and complacence as a white person.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben, I know your anxiety about the inquest.
All will be cleared up, in a legal way, and you’ll be back to your
normal self. Now let’s turn off the lights.</p>
<p><strong>int. court room - first day of inquest - day</strong>: The
inquest of Gordon Ngubene… conducted by MAGISTRATE KLOPPER. In the
witness box is DR. JANSEN, the state pathologist, giving evidence.
Advocate DE VILLIERS is cross examining.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Dr. Jansen, you are a state pathologist
of many years standing and I have no doubt a well-qualified pathologist.
Could you now please tell us what caused the death of the deceased?</p>
<p><strong>dr. jansen</strong>: I found that death had been caused by
the application of force to the neck, consistent with hanging.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: There’s a vigorous reaction to this
around the court, which gives us a chance to discover the crowd:</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: You are sure about the hanging? This
pressure on the neck, could it also have been exerted in other ways?</p>
<p><strong>dr. jansen</strong>: It could, but it is not for me to
speculate.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Of course not, Doctor. The list of
injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long; bruises, swellings,
abrasions, broken rib, lacerations, etc. How long before death do you
estimate he received these injuries?</p>
<p><strong>dr. jansen</strong>: I couldn’t say exactly.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Roughly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. jansen</strong>: Some were fourteen to twenty days old,
others three to four days and others even more recent.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Even more recent. I see. I understand
you had a Dr. Hassiem present at the autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. jansen</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: There were two reports, ours and his.
Did they tally?</p>
<p><strong>dr. jansen</strong>: Yes, it was. In most respects.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Isn’t it normal practice to have one
report? Why did Dr. Hassiem decide to draw up a separate report? If he
really co-signed yours.</p>
<p><strong>dr. jansen</strong>: That’s for him to answer!</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: I would very much like to, Dr. Jansen,
but he’s been detained – you know of course that he represented the
Ngubene family. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. herzog</strong>: the police physician, giving
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Dr. Herzog, did you examine the
deceased?</p>
<p><strong>dr. herzog</strong>: Yes, one day Captain Stolz called me in.
The man had toothache.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: That’s all?</p>
<p><strong>dr. herzog</strong>: As far as I could tell – yes.</p>
<p><strong>de viliers</strong>: You didn’t examine him thoroughly?</p>
<p><strong>dr. herzog</strong>: Why should I? The man was perfectly
healthy, just complaining of toothache. I extracted three decayed teeth,
and gave him aspirin for the pain… that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Did the captain or anyone else assist
you during the examination?</p>
<p><strong>dr. herzog</strong>: I… I cannot remember.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Dr. Herzog, tell us. Have you been
intimidated by the Security Police or did you deliberately cooperate
with them in playing their disgusting little game of hide-and-seek?</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: I protest, Your Worship.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Advocate De Villiers, will you refrain
from insinuations?</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Thank you, Doctor Herzog… I’m sure
Gordon Ngubene was extremely grateful!</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Advocate Louw?</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: Thank you, Your Worship. I’d like to call
Captain Stolz.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: You’re a police officer stationed at John
Vorster Square?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: That’s right, Your Worship.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: You arrested Gordon Ngubene. Could you
describe what happened?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Acting on information we had received, I went
to the house of the deceased, accompanied by Lieutenant Venter,
Lieutenant Botha, and three native members of the security force. This
was about 10 P.M. I informed Ngubene that he was under arrest under
Article 6 of the Terrorism Act. He then became violent and resisted
arrest. A certain force had to be applied to restrain him.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: We found several incriminating documents.
These pointed to his involvement with the A.N.C. and activities
endangering the security of the state.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: Was the deceased ever assaulted to your
knowledge?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Never. He was always treated with courtesy
and correctness. But, one time we had cause to use force against him. It
was the day before his death. The deceased suddenly showed signs of
aggression. He tried to jump through the open window of my office. He
was acting like a mad man. It took six of my men to restrain him, and he
had to be manacled hand and foot, for his own safety. But once he calmed
down, he was ready to make a statement about his activities. The next
morning we found him dead in his cell.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Is the statement in evidence?</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: No, Your Worship. It can’t be disclosed in
court without damaging our investigation, but I would like to offer into
evidence a suicide note written by the deceased.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: ‘Dear Captain. I prefer to die rather than
betray any more of my friends. Amandla! Gordon Ngubene.’</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: Thank you, Your Worship.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Advocate De Villiers?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ben is disgusted. He looks about the
court, as if seeking allies. His eyes meet Melanie’s – just for a second
there’s recognition – then he returns to De Villiers. Advocate De
Villiers cross-examining Captain Stolz.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Thank you, Your Worship. Captain Stolz,
you said you treated the deceased always with courtesy and correctness,
then how do you account for the injuries found on the body?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Sometimes detainees deliberately injure
themselves for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: You say he tried to jump out of the
open window… Are there no bars to prevent such an act?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: They had been removed for repair.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: And why did he wish to jump out?
Because you were torturing him?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: He wasn’t tortured.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Perhaps it was the toothache then.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: You said you seized incriminating
documents at the deceased’s home; can you produce them to see how
subversive he was?</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: Those documents cannot be introduced as
evidence, Your Worship, in view of the fact that state security is
involved.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Magistrate makes a note.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: I put it to you, Captain – that the
only subversive activities the deceased had been involved in were his
efforts to establish what happened to his son, Jonathan, allegedly shot
during a riot, although several witnesses are prepared to testify that
he died in detention one month later.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: I protest…</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: This would support my case that an
innocent man has died in your hands under highly questionable
circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: If it please Your Worship… this unwarranted
slur on the integrity of the special branch is unacceptable… and based,
I may say, on allegations which are in any case irrelevant to the
present inquest.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: If the police are really interested in
retaining an unsullied reputation, they should not object to the real
facts being presented. Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: The real facts are being presented – as the
following affadivits prove. They are all by detainees – who testify that
they had all seen the deceased intermittently from the time of his
detention – to the time of his death – and on all occasions he was in
good health.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As the documents are passed to the
Magistrate, they are scorned by De Villiers. Imperviously he
requests:</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: I trust the signatories of these …
documents… are available to corroborate their evidence in person.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Mr. Archibald, when did you first meet
Gordon Ngubene?</p>
<p><strong>archibald</strong>: crowd, then to De</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Are you saying that you didn’t sign
this statement?</p>
<p><strong>archibald</strong>: … I never met Mr. Ngubene… they forced me
to sign. Captain Stolz, he hit me many times with a rubber hose… he said
he would kill me ’less I signed… this… this is what he did to me.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Advocate Louw?</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: No thank you, Your Worship.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: May we put up the second signatory?</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: Your Worship – the other three signatories
cannot appear for reasons of state security.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Your Worship, I’d like to recall
Captain Stolz.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Captain, you’re still under oath – you
took Archibald’s statement. Was it voluntary? I’m sure you’ll say it
was, then how did he come by the injuries on his back?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: He fell down the stairs a few days ago.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Fell down the stairs. You should do
something about those stairs, Captain, so many people fall on them.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Your Worship, may I be excused? I have to
escort detainee Archibal back to John Vorster Square.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: You may, Captain, and thank you. I think
this’s a good moment to adjourn – we’ll reconvene at two thirty.</p>
<p><strong>ext. courtroom - day</strong>: Emily, Margaret, Stanley and a
man, are sitting outside the court eating fish and chips. There are
various Africans sitting around for their lunch break.</p>
<p><strong>int. cafe near court - day</strong>: Ben and Dan Lewinson
having a light lunch in a nearby cafe.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: De Villiers is making mincemeat of them.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: He’s very good. His cross- examination has
got them rattled.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s obvious to anybody! The evidence is clear!
Did you see Archibal’s back? He didn’t have to tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: That’s what Stolz is saying to him right
now in his torture room.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Captain Stolz lied. My husband never fight
the police when he was arrested. They were rough with him, pushing him
and threatening.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: When your husband’s clothes were given
to you, in what condition were they?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: There was blood on them and in the back
pocket I found three broken teeth.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Now Mrs. Ngubene, you have seen the
note that’s said to have been written by your husband. Do you recognize
the writing?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: That’s not how my husband writes. He never
wrote that letter, they lie.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Ngubene.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Advocte Louw?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Magistrate and in</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ON Ben, satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Will you take the woman out?</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: I’d like to call my last witness. Grace
Nkosi.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Were you ever detained?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes sir, at John Vorster Square.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Six months.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Can you tell us what happened to you
during that time?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I was interrogated by many special policemen,
but mainly Captain Stolz and the one they call Venter. As they were
searching somebody I know, they wanted me to tell them where that person
was hidden. As I refuse to cooperate they beat me with a sjambok. After
some time I fell and they kicked me in the face and stomach.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I spot blood and they try to make me lick it.
Then Captain Stolz threw a wet towel and started twisting it around my
neck… … until I lost consciousness. They did this several time and the
last one Captain Stolz said ‘come on meid, speak up, or do you want to
die like Gordon Ngubene?’ A few days later I was released.</p>
<p><strong>de villiers</strong>: Thank you, Miss Grace. That’s all, Your
Worship.</p>
<p><strong>louw</strong>: at Grace for some</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s the truth. I have nothing more to
say.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: We shall adjourn until tomorrow morning.
I’ll hear the arguments and give the verdict.</p>
<p><strong>int. courtroom - morning</strong>: A silent black crowd;
Emily, Margaret, Stanley anxiously awaiting the verdict. Today the
public gallery is more crowded than before.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: I wish to thank both advocates for
conducting this case without rancour and in the best traditions of the
South African legal profession.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ON Ben’s face. ON Dan Lewinson’s face.
ON Viljoen and Stolz’s faces.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: I have listened to all the evidence and
the arguments. To begin with I have to say that there was no conclusive
evidence offered to prove beyond doubt that members of the Security
Police had been guilty of assault or any irregular conduct on the
deceased. There were indications that Ngubene was aggressive and on more
than one occasion had to be restrained with force. There was sufficient
evidence to conclude that death had been caused by a trauma following
pressure applied to the neck, consistent with hanging. Consequently, I
find that Gordon Ngubene committed suicide by hanging himself and that
on available evidence his death cannot be attributed to any act or
omission or amounting to a criminal offense on the part of any
person.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Viljoen and Stolz smiling, shaking hands
with Advocate Louw in congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: totally depressed, walking up to Emily.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Don’t worry, man. There’s another day!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: ‘Mister Du Toit, how do you know
Mrs. Ngubene?’ ‘Mister Du Toit, can you answer, is it true, he was a
terrorist?’</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Mister Du Toit, what do you think of the
verdict? Do you believe the police?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hang on, Melanie, I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My car is over there.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Never mind your car. Let’s get away from
these vultures.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They get into the car and as they drive
away, Melanie introduces herself.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: By the way, I’m Melanie Bruwer.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Obviously of the Rand Daily Mail. I read your
article about Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Ten out of ten, Mr. Du Toit. I know about
you too.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: We have a mutual friend. One Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I remember. The mortuary in Soweto… … The
ambiguous Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Stanley? No. Just careful. A big black
rough uncut diamond. Don’t be fooled by his happy-go- lucky attitude.
There’s much more to him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He couldn’t have given you a glowing report of
me. I’m sorry, but where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I thought a cooling drink at my house.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Bruwer, I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I promise you. I’m not after an interview
or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I really must go home.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Please, Mr. Du Toit, and you’ll meet my
darling father.</p>
<p><strong>ext. melanie’s home - day</strong>: Melanie drives into the
yard. The house is an old Colonial style house amidst flowers, bushes
and trees, a controlled wild garden. A figure is bent over a beehive. A
large brimmed old hat with a net hides his head and features. Melanie
stops the car in the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: There he is by the eucalyptus tree, on the
left. That’s old Bruwer.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How long have you lived here?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Oh, about twenty-one years. I love this
house.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Is that you, Melanie?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Of course, Dad. I want you to meet a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Does anyone have a friend nowadays?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He straightens up and throws the net
over his head and studies Ben. MR. BRUWER is seventy years old; an
interesting face with a goatee beard.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Mr. Du toit, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Do you like bees?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have nothing against them.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Be careful, I can see philosophy
coming.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: You shut up. Let me tell you about bees, and
for that matter ants: a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose
– based on the common good. A course from which he cannot be deflected.
Greed, ambition, they mean nothing to him. He lives solely to serve his
fellow bee.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What about individuality, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: There’s the rub, my girl. There’s the rub.
One of these days I’ll ask the bees. I’m sure they have the answer. Now,
you two run along!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: A drink, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: I’ve been peeing too much this morning.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: That’s my Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>int. melanie’s living room - day</strong>: The Bruwer living
room is a profusion of piles of papers, of books on shelves, on tables,
on the floor, paintings – records, African sculptures. On the floor
tangled lengths of flex leading from a record player to two voluminous
speakers.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Now you see in what environment I</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Please sit down, on that chair. That’s
Dad’s. Drink?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please. A…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: A brandy?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: surprised, then</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: The mugs are the few things that Dad
brought from Germany. He studied philosophy in Tubingen and Berlin
before the last war.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I thought they were German?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Mr. Du Toit, tell…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please, call me Ben.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: All right, Ben, tell me, why are you so
depressed? You really expect a different verdict?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why do you ask? Can you understand it?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Of course I understand it. What could they
have. I’m not cynical. I’m only trying to be realistic.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell me, Miss Bruwer…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Ben and Melanie, that’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell me, do you believe in the notion of
justice?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’ll never stop believing. But in this
country I’ve learned it’s pointless to look for it in certain
situations.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What use is a system if justice does not apply
to all situations?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Exactly. And you cannot fight for justice
unless you know injustice very well. You’ve got to know your enemy
first.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s a tall order: ‘know injustice… know the
enemy.’ it seems I have a long haul ahead of me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Not at all, Ben. You have already taken the
first steps. Welcome to South Africa!</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s bedroom - night</strong>: Susan is sitting at the
dressing table. She is applying cleansing cream to her face. She is
relaxed. Ben is getting ready for bed.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Did you enjoy the ‘bobotie?’ When I heard the
verdict on the news I knew you’d be upset. I wanted to make you
something special.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you, darling.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m glad it’s all over. You take things to
heart too much.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They killed Gordon – first they kill Jonathan,
and then him. How can they get away with it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Now come on, Ben. Gordon’s death upset me,
too. But the Magistrate had all the facts. He must know what he’s doing,
he’s had years of experience. The case has run its course, and nobody
can do anything more about it! It’s all over and done with.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not so sure about that, Susan!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m damned well sure! It’s over, Ben! You
better get that into your head.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: A teacher, always a bloody teacher. You never
moved yourself for us. But for the blacks, oh yes. Whose side are you
on, Ben? And I’m sick and tired of those natives coming here. Why don’t
you bloody well go and live in Soweto?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Now where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Soweto!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: After a few seconds, Ben moves slowly to
the bed and sits on it still in deep thought.</p>
<p><strong>int. newspaper and confectionary shop - morning</strong>:
It’s a Saturday morning.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: More meneer Van de Merwe.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: More meneer du Toit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Our boys gave the Eastern province a
thrashing.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And a packet of tobacco and pipe cleaners.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ben’s house - veranda - morning</strong>: Susan and
Suzette sit there. Suzette’s holding a news- paper – the Ossewa –
Susan’s thoughtful, her face is red and discomposed – obviously she had
cried. The PHONE RINGS but they deliberately ignore it. Ben appears with
the newspapers under his arm, sees Suzette’s sports car and hurries to
join them. Suzette doesn’t even give him a chance to kiss her.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Now, Papa, this is going too far! How could
you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How’s that, Suzette?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: You didn’t stop to think of the family.
Poor mother, how can she face anyone? And tomorrow is Sunday!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now listen…</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: What’s everybody yelling about?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: You listen, Papa, just tell me, why?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you really think I specially arranged for
the photographers to take that picture? And what’s more it’s
distorted.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: What’s distorted about it? Your face is
practically touching that meid’s face, like you were about to kiss
her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Suzette, pull yourself together!</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Today the whole country has seen that
photograph. We, your children, are going to suffer. At this very moment
Chris is negotiating with the Provincial Council. Would you like to see
them cancel it? You have no feeling, Papa!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Suzette!</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: What’s Papa done, anyway? If something
happened to him, wouldn’t you be upset?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Not enough, Johan, to throw myself into the
garden boy’s arms.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That goes without saying.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: There must be easier ways of getting your
name in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who?… I don’t know you and have nothing to say
to you… No thank you for your advice!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s you, Viviers… I appreciate it… of course…
Not yet… Any thank you. Tot siens.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Morning, Mr. Cloete… I’d like to say… …
Mr. Cloete, may I ask what on earth has the picture to do with
politics?… I’m sorry Mr. Cloete, I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bester’s farm - country - day</strong>: The farm is a
typical transvaal farm covering thousands of acres. In the distance
there’s a range of mountains. Several cattle are grazing, herded by a
poorly-clad African and his son, aged 8 years. Bester and Ben are
leaning on the wooden fence of the cattle kraal with calves penned
in.</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Everything was examined in depth in
court.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did you read the papers, Dominee? Were you
happy with what came to light? And is it the Magistrate’s work to
pretend that the facts which came to light didn’t exist?</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Was it really facts, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Ja? What is it Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Does the Baas want me to bring the bull
now?</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Later, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Dankie, Baas.</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: I bought a bull last week.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know, Gordon. What they said about him, that
he was plotting against the government – is a downright lie. He was only
doing what I would have done as a father; searching for his son.</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: No one but God can see what’s in our
hearts.</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Isn’t it presumptuous to pretend we can
speak for someone else?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Have you no faith in your fellow men, Dominee?
Don’t you love your neighbor?</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: Wait a minute, instead of criticizing
blindly, don’t you think we have reason to be proud of the judiciary we
have? suppose this had been Russia; what do you think would have
happened then?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s the use of reaching a court when a
handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said
in that court and by whom? The one man they allowed to speak for
himself, that young Archibald Chigorimbo, didn’t he immediately deny
everything they forced him to say in his statement? And the girl who
spoke of her own torture?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That did not refer to our situation in this
South Africa. Do you know what I believe in, Dominee, that once in one’s
life, just once, one should have enough faith in something to risk
everything for it.</p>
<p><strong>bester</strong>: One can gain the world and still lose one’s
soul. Tea must be ready.</p>
<p><strong>int. dan pienaar school - morning</strong>: The staff is
having coffee during morning break in the staff room. The room has
several easy chairs, a table with the morning newspapers on it. The
walls have pictures of South African scenes. There are several
conversations in Afrikaans. This is the first morning since the
photograph.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: I hope you don’t mind us talking here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t mind, Mr. Cloete.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: I’ll come to the point. You can’t imagine
how shocked I was by that scandalous photograph in the Ossewa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The woman lost her husband, she was shattered
with grief.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: A Kaffir woman, Du Toit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t see that it makes any difference.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Have you gone color blind then? And what
about the apartheid laws? Our first responsibility as teachers is the
reputation of the school, the pupils entrusted to us. We have to be an
example to them in and out of this school yard.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: I thought I had warned you about involving
yourself with Kaffirs. Obviously you didn’t heed my advice. That’s all I
have to say for now.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: ’Morning, Oom Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Viviers.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: Private coffee with Cloete?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good afternoon, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Melanie isn’t home. You are…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ben Du Toit. You have a nice vegetable
garden.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: You mean the area or the produce?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Both. What plants are these?</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: What’s the world coming to? It’s herbs,
can’t you see? Thyme there, oregano over there, feunel next to the
tomatoes, sage here and rosemary somewhere. Poor plants, they re not in
their ideal soil or climate. Next time, I’ll bring some soil from the
mountain of Zeus. Perhaps the old man’s holiness will do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Come, you are just the person to sample my
greengage wine. I don’t suppose you’ve ever tasted it? I’m sure I’m the
only person in the country making greengage wine.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: The first bottle this year, and you don’t
have to tell me if you like it or not. Tell me, did you ever study
philosophy?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not really. I’ve read a few books.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Not bad, in fact quite good. Now where was
I… Oh, I was going to say after decades of philosophy, I find myself
being forced back to the earth. Do you know, Ben, we’re all living in
the spell of abstractions. Hitler, apartheid, the great American dream,
the lot?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What about Jesus?</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: You don’t have to finish it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s quite nice.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Melanie has told me a little about you. It’s
not an easy road you have chosen.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I feel I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Of course you have a choice. Damn it. One
always has a choice. Only thank God you made the choice you did. But all
I want to say is, keep your eyes open, young man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s encouraging.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: We are both Boers, Ben. We know how hard our
people worked to get a toehold on this land; it was a good life. Now
look at the mess. It’s all systems and no God! Sooner or later people
start believing in their way of life as an absolute: unmutable,
fundamental, a precondition. Saw it, with my own eyes in Germany, a
nation running after an idea. Sieg heil, sieg heil. I left there thirty
years ago because I couldn’t take it any longer. And now I see it
happening in my own country, step by step. Terrifyingly predictable.
This sickness of the great abstraction.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ben is so fascinated by the old man’s
conversation he didn’t react. He is learning form his old Afrikaner.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What you say is very interesting and
important.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: Take for example the way the government is
handling the electorate; like a bloody donkey. Carrot in front and kick
at the backside. The carrot is apartheid, Dogma. The kick is quite
simply, fear. Black peril, red peril, whatever name you want to give it.
Fear can be a wonderful ally, Ben. I talk too much, I always do with
younger people, they don’t fall asleep to me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We Afrikaners have to stop to turn a blind eye
and look around us and at ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: You are right. We still have time. History
should teach us about those who regarded themselves as the chosen
people.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Professor Bruwer, may I say I have needed to
hear somebody say some of the things you said. I still have hope for our
country.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: If you lose that you have lost everything.
I’ll get back to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bruwer</strong>: I’ll tell that hot-head daughter of mine
that you came to see her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There is absolutely no doubt that they were
killed in custody. Those responsible must be punished, whoever they are,
or whatever their rank.</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: The problem is laying our hands on
them.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell me, Dan, we lost at the inquest, what
next?</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: The family can file a civil claim.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What does that entail?</p>
<p><strong>lewinson</strong>: To put it briefly, it means we have to
have witnesses, affidavits and any information relating to the arrest
and death of Gordon. We also need similar information on Jonathan. You
see Ben, for example, Stolz figures in both cases. That’s one link at
least.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know what I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I didn’t think you would want to have
anything to do with me after that crap in the Ossewa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why? You didn’t write it.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m a journalist, perhaps tarred with the
same brush.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: So what happened? I can imagine. The
family, the dominee, colleagues, neighbors…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A distorted photograph and a few poisoned words
and meneer Du Toit is a leper. That’s why I called on you the other day,
I needed to talk to somebody rational.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Thanks for the compliment. But remember,
you’re an Afrikaner, you’re one of them. In their eyes they regard you
as the worst kind of traitor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You are an Afrikaner too, and your articles, in
a liberal English paper?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: My mother was a foreigner, I’m not pure,
wragte Afrikaner. They don’t expect the same loyalty from me that they
demand from you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What kind of loyalty? Blind loyalty. Until the
deaths of Jonathan and Gordon, I gave all the loyalty I could give,
laager loyalty. You know, Melanie, we Afrikaners have always lived in
our laager, we have not seen what’s beyond the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Has it ever occurred to you that the Volk
may be scared to leave the laager? That’s the downfall of this country.
So, where do you go from here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We carry on. There has to be justice.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Justice.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We lost at the inquest, so we pursue them in a
civil action. I consulted the attorney Dan Lewinson.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: We know each other well.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Mr. Du Toit, if you knew what we’re working
with every day of our lives, and what we’re up against, you would
understand why we have to be so thorough.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: However you go about it.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: I can understand you’re upset about having
your house searched … but…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wasn’t thinking about myself.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: What are you talking about then, Mr. Du
Toit?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My thoughts, Captain, I’m sure, are an open
book to you.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stolz picks up a book of Picasso’s Peace
Paintings, starts leafing through it carefully, scrutinizing each page.
He puts the Picasso book carefully back in the place he took it
from.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: An interesting book – Picasso – Not one I’m
familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not on your list of banned books, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s living room - day</strong>: The search continues
in the living room. Susan is standing pale, rigid, shocked.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Mr. Du Toit. If you’re keeping anything from
us, we can turn this whole house upside down if we want to. We have all
the time in the world.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: warning daggers</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why don’t you go upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: I’m afraid she has to stay where we can see
her – in case she wanted to warn someone.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: My father’s an M.P.! Warn who?</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s kitchen - afternoon</strong>: Susan is preparing a
roast. There’s music from a trans- istor RADIO. Susan is startled by a
voice, her father’s . She turns OFF, the RADIO.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Roast beef, I hope it’s like your
mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Papa!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Where’s Mama?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The perfume and a new hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your father insisted that I don’t disgrace
you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I expected you a little later.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: She insisted we start early. Where is
Ben?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: In the study. I’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Have you put on weight, Susan?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please don’t say that, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry. Didn’t hear you arrive.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: How are you, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And how are you, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>mother-in-law</strong>: Well, Ben, still have trouble with my
feet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why doesn’t everyone sit down?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’ll prepare some tea. I baked a cake.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: I’m getting tired of the trek to Cape
Town and then back to Pretoria. If I had my way, Parliament and
government would be in the same city. There’s nothing wrong with
Pretoria.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I thought you’d prefer Cape Town; the sea and
Table Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: That’s for holidays. Anyway, Ben, one
of the reasons for this visit was that I wanted to have a discussion
with you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: It’s that photograph in the papers.
Ben, a thing like that could be an embarrassment for someone who is a
member of Parliament. It’s a grievous day when one’s family’s behavior
comes between him and his duty to the fatherland.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you blaming me for trying to help those
people?</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: I’ve been doing that all my life, be
they black or white. But no member of our family has been seen with a
Kaffir woman before, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I am glad you mentioned it, Father. Because I’d
like to discuss the whole thing with you. First, there’s the matter of
Gordon Ngubene himself.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: What about him? I thought the case
was closed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The inquest didn’t clear up half of what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We have no irrefutable evidence yet, but we
have enough to indicate that something serious is being covered up.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: You’re jumping to conclusions,
Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: All right, Ben, I’m listening.
Perhaps I can use my influence. But you’ll have to convince me</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If they have really nothing to hide, why is the
special branch going out of its way to intimidate me.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: What’s this about special branch?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They raided the house; they are tapping my
phone, and I have been threatened by one of the officers.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: I’m sorry, Ben, I’d rather not have
anything to do with this sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: If the special branch are involved
they must have good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s exactly what I said, Father, when Jonathan
first got into trouble. Of course, they have good reasons: hushing up
how Gordon died and how his son died!</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Ben, how could you side with the
enemies of your people?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean you’re prepared to sit back and allow
an injustice to be done.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: It’s you, Ben, who talk about
injustice? A man who teaches history at school? Did you forget what our
people have suffered under the English oppressors? Now that we have at
along last come to power in our own land.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now we’re free to do to others what they used
to do to us. What will you do if you were a black man in this country
today, Father?</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Don’t you realize what the government
is doing for the blacks? It’s a slow process, Ben. One of these days the
whole bloody lot of them will be free and independent in their own parts
of the land, the bantoustans – what can be more just than that? But
they’re not ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: We have nothing to be ashamed of
before the eyes of the world, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We don’t? I’m not sure we’re going to
survive.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Don’t underestimate us, Ben. Our
power of survival. We are Afrikaners!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: African time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Doesn’t matter, Lanie – as long we are on
time for the revolution.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The special branch searched my house four days
ago.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The S.B. searches your house? Did they take
anything?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A few journals, letters – nothing much. Just
wanted to scare me, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Don’t be so sure. They may think you’re
onto something big.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They’re not that stupid.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stanley laughs.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: ‘Lanie’ – don’t you believe it – nothing’s
as stupid as the old S.B. If they decide it’s a bomb they’re looking
for, you can shove a turd in their face and they’ll swear to God it’s a
bomb.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And did they?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Scare you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. They tried too hard.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hallelujah! Shake, man. Join the club.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s living room - night</strong>: Susan sitting on an
armchair, sewing. She is aware of a car stopping opposite the house.
Then several young voices shout: The car drives off at speed.</p>
<p><strong>int. stanley’s car - night</strong>: Ben and Stanley driving
in Soweto.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Did you hear that, Lanie? More kids
dying?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s happening? What’s the singing?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A wake for a child; eight months old. She
was sleeping and they threw tear gas into it.</p>
<p><strong>int. emily’s house - night</strong>: Ben, Stanley and Emily
are sitting ’round the table. Ben has pulled the lamp closer to read one
of two notes from Gordon – one is written on ruled paper, the other a
square of toilet paper. The notes have been smuggled out of John Vorster
Square.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘My dear wife, you must not worry about me.
I miss you and the children. You must look after them in the fear of the
Lord. I’m hungry, and I don’t know what they want from me. But I think
I’ll be home some day. I think about…’</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She opens it and a man with a hat and
dressed as a min- ister walks in. Before anyone can say anything,
Stanley bursts out in a loud laugh. The man is slightly built, aged 40
years. He is JULIUS NQAKULA.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: On your knees, everyone, prayers time.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey man, you should have been a mfundisi
holiness oozer…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Okay, Stanley. It’s stupid, but one is
forced to do these things.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’m Julius Nqakula… I’m banned and also
under house arrest. That’s why I have this ridiculous garb on.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He’s one of the most solid lawyers we have;
they’ve immobilized him, that’s the right word isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stanley has told me about you. I appreciate the
risk you are taking by coming here to meet me. I was reading the notes
Gordon smuggled out of John Vorster Square…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: May I have a glance at them?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘My dear wife. I am still in these
conditions… worse… and too much pain. They don’t want to believe me. You
must try to help me. They won’t stop. You must care for the children. I
don’t know anymore if I will come home alive. They’re very – – but God
will provide. I love you and I miss you very much. Try to help me
because…’</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: When did you get the letters?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: The first one two days after they took him
away. And the other one came later.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But, Emily, why didn’t you tell me long
ago?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I had given my word to the man – who brought
them to me –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Emily, I have to meet the man.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: He said he didn’t want anybody to know who he
is. I cannot make trouble for him in his work.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He has to be persuaded. He is very important to
us.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You as a lawyer will understand.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: We intend starting a civil suit against the
police, to do that it is necessary to have as many affidavits as we can
from people who have any information about Gordon since he was arrested.
And this man is vital and so is the Indian doctor.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You mean Dr. Hassiem. How are you going to
do that? You know of course that he is detained.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know, with luck they may release him.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: With luck.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But, Emily, this man is important, please try
to tell him we will protect his identity. No one will know. Nothing will
be done without his approval. I only want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Why don’t you leave it to Stanley and I?
What do you say, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: May I call you Julius, I’m not very good with
some African names.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Nqakula, that’s a hell of a name.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Please call me Julius.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This case must be reopened and we must win. We
have to dig up everything. We need your cooperation, Julius.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Where do I start? Don’t forget my
restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They did not ban you so you could sit on
your backside and have a Soweto holiday.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You could help with the affidavits. Lewinson
the lawyer has stressed their importance.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We know each other. He’s a good lawyer for
this kind of case. Of course I’ll do what I can. My commitment forces
me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: How are you planning to safeguard the
documents? Stanley told me you have already had a said by the S.B.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wouldn’t worry. I have a secure place.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Let’s hope so.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I’ll make some tea.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Not for me, Sis – too strong for me. No
whisky?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: In my house? You know better than that,
Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Tea then… … and God forgive me –</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s garage - evening</strong>: Ben is standing by the
workbench, the new drawer he and Johan built for the toolbox, open
before him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben, it’s Johan. You’d better come.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He won’t tell me why it happened</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Johan. Was it because of me?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You see! It’s gone too far, Ben. You’ve got
to stop it…</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: I don’t care! It doesn’t hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: It was my friends, Dad. They’re so stupid…
They won’t listen. They don’t even want to know what you’re trying to
do.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you sure you know?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Yes. I know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Does it worry you?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Don’t stop, Dad. You mustn’t give up now!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: in a phone box dialing a number.</p>
<p><strong>phone</strong>: RINGING, RINGING, on a desk full of scattered
files and papers. By the phone a photograph of a six- year-old Indian
girl.</p>
<p><strong>close on nurse</strong>: Sound of the PHONE, a young nurse’s
frightened face as she remembers peering in at a young boy, struggling
and moaning… Policemen closing the door…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: … And on the morning of the autopsy, as I
was cleaning the mortuary, Captain Stolz gave me a bundle of Ngubene’s
and ordered me to burn them.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The young man nods.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: having a look on the two affidavits before
hiding them into the drawer of the stool box.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Call the police, Ben, call the police!</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Papa! Papa!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s okay, son… we’re all right. Everything’s
okay!</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s okay, stay there, please!!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: My God. They were trying to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They were trying to scare us, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Her fear turns into anger.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh, is that all… What the hell more do you
want to happen… we’re ordinary people for God’s sake – and you’ve
pitched us into this – this nightmare. I can’t take any more, Ben… I
can’t take any more!!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please, Ben, stop. Just stop… please.</p>
<p><strong>int. viljoen’s office - day</strong>: The colonel, amiable,
cool, behind his desk. A dishev- elled Ben, pitched angrily forward in
his chair.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Now you must be exaggerating, Mr. Du
Toit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My house has been searched. My phone is tapped.
My mail is opened. And last night three shots were fired through my
window – close to killing my wife.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Mr. Du Toit, if shots were fired into your
premises, we will investigate.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All I want to know, Colonel, is why don’t you
leave me in peace?</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Now wait, wait a minute, Mr. Du Toit,
you’re not trying to blame me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell me, Colonel, why is it so important to you
people to stop my enquiries about Gordon Ngubene?</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Is that what you are doing? Well, now. If
you possess any information that may be of use to us, I trust you won’t
hesitate to discuss it with me.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Because if there are facts you are
deliberately hiding from us, Mr. Du Toit – If you give us reason to
believe that you may be involved in activities that may be dangerous to
both yourself and us – then I can foresee some problems.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is that a threat, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Let’s call it a warning. A friendly
warning. For God’s sake, open your eyes, Mr. Du Toit! Don’t you see
you’re being used!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: By the Communists, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Goodbye, Colonel. I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ben’s kitchen - early morning</strong>: A 40-year-old
African woman walks up to Ben’s kitchen door. She knocks.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street in vrededorp - morning</strong>: Vrededorp is a
colored section of Johannesburg. It’s rundown area vacated by whites.
There are children play- ing in the street. Some unemployed men are
sitting on old chairs outside a doorway; a vendor is serving two women
from his milk churn.</p>
<p><strong>colored woman</strong>: Mr. Du Toit?</p>
<p><strong>colored woman</strong>: Please, come in.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How’s it? No trouble finding this place?
You met Sadie. She’s one of us.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And this is Johnson Seroke. The man of the
letters.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Please sit down, Mr. Du Toit. A beer, tea or
orange squash?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A beer would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know they call this place Vrededorp,
but we baptize it Malay Camp. Your first time in Malay Camp, Lanie?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve driven through here many times.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The main road, eh?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ja.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: You’ll excuse me. Stanley, you know what to
do with the key.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sure, Sadie. And thank you. Can I help
myself to another beer?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: You know it is. Goodbye, Mr. Du Toit, and
you, be careful.</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: Okay, Sadie.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That woman can die for you. We mustn’t be
long, Johnson has to be back on duty.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Alright, let’s get on with it. Stanley tells
me, you work at John Vorster Square.</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: I had no choice, they transferred me
there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yet you smuggled out letters to Emily?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: of his left hand one by one cracking the</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: If they find out he’d be in very big
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know that. Tell me, what do you know about
Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: Very little.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You did talk to him from time to time?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: He gave me the letters.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: Just before he died.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did you attend any of the interrogations?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: No. I’m not a member of the Special Branch.
But once I had to deliver a letter to Capt. Stolz, Gordon was there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How were they interrogating him?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s okay. Tell him what you told me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: They were using the pole.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The pole, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They handcuff you and manacle your feet
then they put a pole between your arms and the back of your knees. Then
you’re like a chicken ready for the oven. They hang you between two
tables. Then they do what they like with you. The S.B. call it the
aeroplane.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I see. Who were in that room? Stolz…</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: Lieutenant Venter and a black S.B.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You are sure?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He’s sure.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s very interesting. When was the last time
you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: I saw them take the body away to the cells.
He was limp.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You did! Johnson, why do you stay with the
police? You don’t really belong there.</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: It’s a job. And how can I go away? I love my
family.</p>
<p><strong>seroke</strong>: They must never know I told you anything.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I understand. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: This is strictly between the three of us.
Don’t worry, man.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A beer, Lanie?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, thank you. You know, Stanley, after what
happened the other night I was about to give this whole thing up.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What happened, man?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My wife nearly got killed. Three shots were
fired into the house. What right have I to expose my family to
harassment and actual physical danger? That’s what I asked myself.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Three bloody shots and you crawl on your
hands and knees to people like Stolz, and say ‘I give up.’ What is the
beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all our bloody life.
Shit, I thought you had more guts than this, man!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t say I’m giving up.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: But you thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Johnson has revived my determination.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s a hell of a time, Lanie, but we’ll
survive. You and me. I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You think we may still win in the end,
Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Of course not, Lanie – but we needn’t lose
either – what matters is to stick around.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: By the way, man, I’m off on a trip –
Botswana – thought I’d tell you in case you get worried.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why are you going there?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Business. Tell you next week. Now for the
bad news I’ve been saving to the last.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Julius has been arrested. He broke his
banning order and visited his sister. You know what that means? At least
a year’s imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A year in jail just for visiting his
sister?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s the chance he took. And he’ll be the
last to complain.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t you think the real reason for this arrest
was that they found out he was helping us?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So what? Lanie, you’re not getting guilt
complexes now, are you? That’s a luxury only liberals can afford. Julius
will be back, man. All refreshed by a spell in the deep-freeze.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How can we shrug off a man we’ve been working
with?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who said we’re shrugging him off? Best way
of remembering a man, Lanie, is to carry on fighting.</p>
<p><strong>int. bruwer kitchen - afternoon</strong>: This is a
medium-sized kitchen with two doors leading from it, one to the dining
room and the other to the living room. It has not changed since it was
furnished twenty years ago, the only modern appliances being the
electric stove and a modern mixer on the working table.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean not married…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: And living in this chaos with my eccentric
father? I love him and we get on perfectly. We have been together since
I was a year old. My mother could not adapt to South Africa. She went
back to London and we’ve never heard from her since.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Being a professor and bringing up a child, how
did he manage that?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Dorothy, dear Dorothy, she was a fantastic
mother. In fact she had two families, me and her three children in
Alexandra township.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And this little girl grew up to be a tough
journalist. Why a journalist?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Sometimes I ask myself the same
question.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Alright. I’ll tell you. I was brought up in
a sheltered way, not that Dad was possessive, not openly anyway. I think
he’d just seen enough of the mess the world was in, to want to protect
me as much as he could. Then, I went to university. I don’t know what
you’ll think… being a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Then I married my ex-teacher.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh. He must have been young.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Fifteen years difference. He too protected
me like Dad. Then one day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her
home and the appalling conditions in that township. I was shocked, Ben,
and ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: That made me think that I was a parasite,
something white and maggot-like… just a thing… a sweet and ineffectual
thing. I felt more and more claustrophobic. Poor Brian, who loved and
pampered me. Had no idea what was happening. I left him for a whole year
and we divorced.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And then you became a journalist?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I thought it would force me, or help me, to
expose myself. To force me to see and to take notice of what was
happening around me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I wish I could give you a straight answer.
What did help me was my</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How did you manage that on a South African
passport? We South Africans are white devils in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: My mother was English, remember? So I get a
British passport. It comes in handy even for the paper.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You really are your father’s daughter!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I wonder what he’s doing right now. Most
likely standing on a rock, looking through his old binoculars at
springbok or a lion or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How often does he go on these trips to the
veldt?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: It depends – – Bonjour, Ben. I’m Porto and
my friend is Bello!</p>
<p><strong>ext. soweto - emily’s house - mid-morning</strong>: Parked
outside the house is a municipality truck already half-laden with
Emily’s furniture and possessions. Four Africans in khaki overalls are
loading the truck – super- vising the eviction of Emily are a white
Soweto official, Captain Stolz and Lt. Venter. In the b.g., a hundred
yards away is a “hippo” with black and white armed policemen. Behind the
truck are two police Land Rovers.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Don’t you touch me!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Come back! Buya!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Buya! Buya!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He turns furtively and sees the man,
stopped, turning his head. Ben decides to turn the corner, and listens
to the FOOTSTEPS. The man is still following. Ben then decides to turn
right back to have a good look at the man. They pass each other and Ben
takes a good look at him and turns back onto the streets to the local
shops. The man decides not to follow.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s study - night</strong>: Ben and Stanley sit. Ben
on his desk. Stanley in an armchair with a drink. They look
perplexed.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: She’s a widow, man. That’s what happens in
Soweto when a woman loses her man. They throw her out of the house and
out of the city.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Zululand! The whole thing smells of being an
excuse to send her hundreds of miles from the case. And how will they
live there?…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shit! I was about to find her a place, but
I had to go to look for Robert.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So, that’s why you went to Botswana for.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sis Emily asked me but it was no use. His
mind was made up. He was going to join Wellington in Zambia.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Couldn’t you stop him? He’s a little boy,
Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He’ll be back in a few years. And he won’t
be throwing stones!</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. stanley’s house - evening</strong>: Stanley peers
through the curtains: he sees a car parked outside the house. In it
Jaimie and another S.B. They are watching the house. Stanley quietly
opens the door and walks outside.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Good evening. I’d like to invite you into
my humble home, but it’s full of terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>jaimie</strong>: Open the boot! You cheeky bastard!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Okay, with pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>jaimie</strong>: Open the door and remove the seat.</p>
<p><strong>other policeman</strong>: Now, your pass, bliksem.</p>
<p><strong>jaimie</strong>: You watch your bloody step! Right?</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s bedroom - night</strong>: Ben and Susan in bed,
asleep. The PHONE RINGS… waking them both. Ben answers. There’s no one
there. He puts it down. The RINGING STARTS AGAIN. Ben puts the re-
ceiver down.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ben, please stop whilst there’s time. Please,
Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s impossible to stop now, Susan. I believe
I’m right in what I’m doing. If I stop now I’ll go mad.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Whatever the price you pay for it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have got to.</p>
<p><strong>int. cloete’s office - late afternoon</strong>: It’s a
functional office. Picture of the South African president John Vorster,
on the wall. Various staff pictures… Ben, summoned by Cloete, sits.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Think of your heritage, man. My God – think
of your wife, your family, friends, neighbors. What’s going to happened
to them – all of us – if we can’t depend on our own kind? We’re
educationalists – teachers. We are building for the future.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Without simple justice we don’t deserve a
future.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: We’re Boers, man – Afrikaners. We are your
nation. What’s justice for us is justice – period!</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Traitors like you are threatening centuries
of Afrikaner sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That last remark was slanderous – I’m simply
being faithful to the truth.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Slanderous? My God, man, you slander a whole
people.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: You have given me no alternative. I have to
abide by the regulations of the Department of Education – so I have made
my report. And there will have to be a formal inquiry. But until such
time…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It won’t be necessary, Mr. Cloete. I’ll send
you my resignation.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: Thank you for making things much easier.</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: And it would be better if Johan left
too.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>cloete</strong>: He’s a Kaffir-lover too, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>ext. school yard - late afternoon</strong>: It’s the end of
the school day. The yard is practically deserted. Only Viviers waiting
for Ben under the veranda.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: Oom Ben, I was waiting for you. I have
something interesting to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Later, Viviers.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: But, Oom Ben, it’s about the S.B. they came
to question me. Before they started questioning me I told them they were
wasting their time.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: They asked if I was cooperating with you.
What I knew about the A.N.C. Can you imagine that! They then said:
’Mr. Viviers you come from a good Afrikaans family and it’s important
that you realize that communists are looking for people like you and
before you know where you are they’re using you! And, Oom Ben…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry, Viviers. I never wanted you to get
involved. I have just resigned.</p>
<p><strong>viviers</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s dining room - afternoon</strong>: Christmas day
lunch. Assembled around the table are Ben’s Father-in-law, his wife
Helen, Suzette and Chris, her husband, Johan, Ben and Susan. They’re all
wearing paper hats from Christmas crackers. On the table is a large
piece of roast lamb, ox tongue, a large turkey and assorted
vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Was last year’s turkey as big as this,
Papa?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: About the same size.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Do you remember the turkey I had for
Easter? You said it was as big as a baby ostrich, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t remember that, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: You know, Johan, when I was a boy in
the Karoo, we used to fry ostrich eggs. You know how big they are?</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: As big as this table.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think he deserves the parson’s nose for that
remark.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: by this family</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: ‘Lanie’… compliments of the season, old
mate.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stanley. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Who’s this Kaffir, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why don’t you tell the Boer who this Kaffir
is?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shut up, Stanley. That’s all right. I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: A Kaffir calling me a Boer?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ben, did you hear that? Call the police,
Ben!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please, go to the table. Stanley, wait
outside.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who are these people, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stanley, this is still my house.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Let me throw him out.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Let him try, leave him, Lanie.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please leave me with him. I’ll explain
everything later.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Nothing has changed in this house.
Mother, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>int. dining room - afternoon</strong>: Susan sits with her
eyes tight shut – trying to shut out the horror of it all. As the
Father-in-law goes into the living room, he pulls back his wife’s chair
and helps her to her feet.</p>
<p><strong>father-in-law</strong>: Let’s leave this house. I’ve been
sworn at by a Kaffir and Ben protects him.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Chris!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Lanie! Ever in your fucking life seen such
a stampede, hah?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe you think it’s funny, Stanley, but I
don’t. Do you realize what you’ve done? Come into the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Jeez, who was that old cunt with the
potbelly and black suit, looks like an undertaker?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My father-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You joking! Shit! I fucked it all up for
you. Sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now pull yourself together, Stanley. It’s not
funny at all! What’s the matter with you today? You’re drunk and making
an idiot of yourself. Say what you’ve come to say. Otherwise, go to
hell!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Right. Dead right. Put the Kaffir in his
place.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Bloody hell! Stanley, what’s wrong with
you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Emily is dead.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Emily dead? How? When?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What happened, Stanley? Oh, my God. Please tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A broken heart. All they said.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: God.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: They don’t know what you’ve got and you’re
a danger to them. I know there’s a point of no return, but with our
system, one has to plot the route with care.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s the main reason for coming here tonight.
Melanie, I need your help. Without Emily, we can’t pursue our civil
suit. The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the
press, and the media here and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: And your safety also, Ben, lies in the
press. That way the world will know the brutality and power of our
security services; here questions can be asked in Parliament. And the
white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this
country.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know, Melanie, I’m discovering that the
enemy is not in Soweto. The enemy is ourselves. Our bigotry, our laws,
our system. We have our own fight and it’s just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: We better win before the blacks have
won.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now, before going to the press, I have to have
all the documents. I must have two vital affidavits; Dr. Hassiem’s, he’s
detained and Jonathan’s friend, Wellington has fled to Zambia.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Zambia? I’m going to Rhodesia… I can go to
Zambia.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Could you?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: And I can use my British passport. I know
my way around Lusaka.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That would be very useful.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: This calls for a drink. Gin and tonic?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Melanie. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: record and</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Cheers!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do be careful. I wouldn’t want you hurt.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And hurry back.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: That’s my favorite, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t dance.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Rugger player?</p>
<p><strong>int. local supermarket - morning</strong>: Ben is shopping at
the local supermarket. He is pushing a trolley. As he places some
groceries into his trolley, he notices a man standing near the check-out
counters. The man is similar built as Jamie and similar hairstyle. He’s
reading a newspaper, his face concealed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen, you…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Darling, put that down, it’s not good for
your cholesterol.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry, my mistake.</p>
<p><strong>ext. suzette’s house - swimming pool - day</strong>: The
immaculate blue of the pool. Johan hurls himself out of the water, flops
down at the side. Suzette and Ben nearby, sitting in the sun.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: – How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Better… She’s waiting for you to ask her to
come home.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She turns to Ben, squinting in the
sun.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Papa, I don’t want to interfere…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then don’t.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: I know this is going to sound strange
coming from me… I mean I haven’t exactly been supportive for the past
months… I can’t say I agree with what you’ve done but I respect you for
what you are…</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: I’m just… destroyed by what’s happening to
us as a family.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Suzette…</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Please, Papa, for Mom’s sake… For all of
our sakes… Let’s try and patch it up.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Let me know if there’s anything I can do to
help.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thanks. I’m glad you understand.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: I don’t want to worry about you. That
search, this vandalism, those shots… they’re really after the evidence
you’ve been accumulating … Can I look after them for you, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You don’t have to worry. They’ll never find
them.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Where on earth do you keep them?</p>
<p><strong>ext. indian township - day</strong>: Ben has parked his car
in a street corner of the upmarket section of the Asian township. He
peers around him, then walks away. Ben knocks at a door. The door is
opened cautiously by DR. HASSIEM, a tall, handsome Indian, aged 35
years. His clothes are casual but expensive. His six-year-old daughter,
large dark eyes, is clinging to his leg. We recognize the little girl of
the photograph near the telephone, from earlier.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Dr. Hassiem? I’m Ben Du Toit. I’m a friend of
Gordon Ngubene’s…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: The inquest is over, Mr. Du Toit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not for me, Doctor. I’ve got to know what
happened to Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: I only came home yesterday. After three
months in detention and now I’m banned and confined to the house.
There’s nothing I can do for you.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The little girl still clinging to his
leg, watching Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know it may be painful to you, Doctor, but I
need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: How can I be sure you weren’t actually
sent by them?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ask Emily. Doctor, we are in the process of
filing a civil claim. And your help is vital.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you for inviting me in.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just one thing, Doctor. Why did you sign the
State Pathologist’s report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report
as well?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: What makes you think I signed
Dr. Jansen’s report.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The report produced in court had both your
signatures on it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What did you write in your report?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: Dr. Jansen and I didn’t disagree on the
facts. After all we examined the same body in the same time. But just on
the interpretation. For example, if Gordon, had really been hanged, the
marks on his throat would have been concentrated on the front. But in
this case, the bruises were more obvious on the sides.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: Something else really upset me, perhaps
it isn’t important.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: You see, through a misunderstanding I
arrived at the morgue too early for the autopsy. There wasn’t a soul
around except a young African attendant. When I told him I’d come for
the autopsy, he let me in. The body was on the table dressed. I noticed
blood on the clothes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: As I examined the clothes more closely,
a police-officer came in and said I wasn’t allowed in the morgue before
Dr. Jansen arrived. When I returned with Dr. Jansen, half an hour later,
the body was naked.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Doctor, we’ve already got the African
attendant’s affidavit. He testified that Capt. Stolz ordered him to burn
the clothes. Did you mention what you said in your report?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: Of course. I found it most odd.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Doctor Hassiem would you be prepared to put
that in writing?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: Please excuse me for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: This is my report. I only have one
copy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You have a copy of the report?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: I know how to hide things from the
S.B., Mr. Du Toit.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: On Dr. Hassiem’s desk we recognize next
to the phone, the little girl’s photograph.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hassiem</strong>: I hope you have as secure a place as I
have.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>int. building in construction - late afternoon</strong>: A
multi-storied building half-built. Stanley standing on the fourth floor
watching Ben’s arrival.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Take a pew, man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We have it, Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Have what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hassiem’s report. You know what that means,
Stanley? Melanie arrives in two days. We’ll have all the evidence.
Everything is in place. We’ll get them yet, especially Stolz.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s fantastic, man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: God! It’s Johnson Seroke.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Late at night. A knock on the door. He
opened and five shots, point-blank range. Face, chest, stomach.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: ’A police spokesman when questioned said: “It’s
not the first time that a black member of the police has lost his life
in the service of his country, fighting terrorism.” Bloody bastards!
They killed him. Stolz must have thought he knew too much.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s the score? The nurse is detained;
the mortuary attendant has disappeared; the police van driver who
brought Jonathan to hospital is detained. Julius is in jail, and now
Johnson dead.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who’s next on their secret list, I wonder? How
much longer must the list grow of those who pay the price of our efforts
to clear Gordon’s name.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey! Are you going soft, Lanie? We must
keep going even more so now. And for every bloke who’s going to die of
bloody natural causes in their hands. And for our children’s future.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know. If I can no longer believe that right
is on my side, if I can no longer believe in imperative to go on, what
will become of me, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s study - day</strong>: A 8x10 black and white
photograph on Ben’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: On the photograph a naked man and a girl
on a bed and a bedside lamp on its side. The man is Ben and the girl is
Melanie. Stolz in sports jacket, standing next to the desk is speaking…
patronizing.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: We’re all made of flesh and blood, Mr. Du
Toit – we’ve all got our flaws. And if a man likes to sample the grass
on the other side of the fence, well, that’s his own business. But it
would be unpleasant if people found out about it, especially if he’s a
teacher.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean, if I cooperate, if I stop digging,
embarrassing you, threatening you… these photographs will disappear.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Let’s just say I may be able to use my
influence to make sure that a private indiscretion isn’t used against
you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Suppose I refuse?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Is this your son?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Johan, leave us alone, please.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Don’t you think this business has gone long
enough?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s for you people to decide. Isn’t it? I
won’t be blackmailed, Captain – not even by you.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Mind if I smoke?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Now be honest. Has all the evidence you’ve
been collecting in connection with Gordon Ngubene brought you closer to
the truth you are looking for?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, I think so and there’s more to come.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: I really hoped we could talk man-to-man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not possible, Captain. Not between you and
me.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: It’s high time, Mr. Du Toit, we allowed the
dead to rest in peace. I’m offering you a chance.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean my very last chance?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: One never knows. It may not be important to
you, but we have to survive.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If we can only survive through murder and
torture, then we have forfeited our right to exist.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Is that your final answer?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Before you go. I’ll tell this, Captain. I have
a pretty good idea of what I will eventually uncover. I mean the truth.
And I won’t allow anyone or anything to come between me and that
truth.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Here’s my card – my private line. If you
should change your mind… Let’s say before the end of the week?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Goodbye, Captain, and don’t forgt the
photograph.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Be careful, Mr. Du Toit. There are people who
can make things very difficult for you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They are wasting their time. They just can’t
hurt me anymore. I trust you’ll give them the message, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: A brandy, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A gin and tonic would be fine.</p>
<p><strong>int. jan smuts airport - day</strong>: Ben and Johan are
standing in the public enclosure on the top floor of the airport
building. Ben is unshaved, he looks tired, but happy. There is the usual
bustle of airport staff for the steps and luggage, two-thirds of the
staff being black.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Excuse me, I’m waiting for a lady with a red
dress. Are there still, many people to come?</p>
<p><strong>indian woman</strong>: I did see her. She was ahead of me.
Maybe she’s still in there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m waiting for a passenger, Miss Bruwer. She’s
taking a rather long time to be cleared.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: What did you say her name was?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Melanie Bruwer.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: I’ll go and check.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Official hurries back.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Is there any other exit, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. They have to collect their luggage and pass
through customs.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Maybe she can’t find her bag.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s possble.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Afternoon, Meneer Du Toit. Johan, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What now, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: Word came to me that you were asking after
your very good friend, Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives come in all
guises and can be very resourceful. Now let’s take your friend, she has
been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of
this country. But you know something else? She has been secretly holding
a British passport. A South African passport and a British pasport. Now
you tell me, where is her patriotism? Her allegiance? The minister
telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable
immigrant. So she is being put on the first available plane to London.
This must be heart- breaking for you. Good afternoon, Meneer Du Toit,
Johan.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s go home, Johan.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: I don’t understand, Papa…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll explain later.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: I took it out. Hide it in my secret
place.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you, son. You did a man’s job.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Before him, scattered on the table: the
affidavits he collected, the Hassiem report, cuttings of articles by
Melanie in the Rand Daily Mail about Jonathan, newspaper pictures of
Gordon, of Seroke, of himself with Emily, the half-burnt “peace
painting” of Picasso, half-burnt photo of Ben with Suzette, a staff
photograph, Ben amongst it, and a charred trophy.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: Somebody has dropped it through the door.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>johan</strong>: I’m nearly ready, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wellington’s affidavit!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good old Melanie!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Johan gets on the bike and rides
out.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Meneer du Toit, tonight we’re coming to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s happened, man?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s you. It was a bomb.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And the papers?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t worry. Safe. Thanks to Johan.
Incidentally, I have Wellington’s affidavit. Melanie found him. She’s
being deported. The official reason is that she possessed a British
passport. I don’t know how she managed to smuggle the envelope to
me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Man, it’s all happening!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Like a joint?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They drop the bomb on you!</p>
<p><strong>ext. johannesburg street - day</strong>: It’s raining.
Stanley driving in the rain on the same road as Johan.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: straight in</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Okay, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Would you like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: I have to go, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look after them.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: I see you got the goodies.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: I was on my way to your office,
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>stolz</strong>: We thought we’d save you the trouble,
Mrs. Klopper.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Here it is, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Thank you. This country needs more people
like you.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: I must hurry, Colonel. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>int. captain stolz’s car - day</strong>: Stolz gets into the
car as Colonel Viljoen starts open- ing the brown envelope.</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: Now let’s see what we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ben Du Toit</p>
<p><strong>viljoen</strong>: The bastard!</p>
<p><strong>ext. rand daily mail building - day</strong>: Johan hurries
out of the building and is about to get on his bike. His attention is
drawn by Stanley’s familiar</p>
<p><strong>hooter.</strong>: Johan turns, sees Stanley, and with a grin
makes thumbs- up sign which happy Stanley returns with his large thumb.
Johan cycles away followed by Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>int. cafe - day</strong>: Ben looks at his watch. He goes to
the cash desk and pays. He walks slowly out of the cafe. Stands at the
door to find his car keys; the rain has emptied the street. Ben turns up
his collar and waits for a break in the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - day</strong>: Captain Stolz alone in the car.
He drives around the corner into the cafe street.</p>
