<p><strong>anakin</strong>: There isn’t a droid made that can out fly
you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Look out, four droids inbound . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We’ve got to split them up.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Break left, fly through the guns on that
tower.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always
the bait?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m coming around behind
you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, they’re all over me!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him,
Artoo . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We got him, Artoo!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I copy, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m going down on the deck.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Good idea … I need some room to
maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don’t
let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Hurry up! I don’t like this!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t even try to fix it, Arfour. I’ve shut
it down.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We’re locked on … we’ve got him . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yeah! We got him . . . good going,
Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Next time you’re the bait . . . Now let’s
find the Command Ship and get on with it …</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General
Grievous’s ship is directly ahead.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The one crawling with vulture droids.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Come on, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Not this time. There’s too much at stake.
We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>odd ball</strong>: Copy, Red Leader.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Mark my position and form your squad up
behind me . . .</p>
<p><strong>odd ball</strong>: We’re on your tail, General Kenobi. Set
S-foils in attack position.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture
Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . .
.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m going head to head. See you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Take it easy, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>odd ball</strong>: I’m on your right, Red Leader.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Incoming!!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Five more on the right!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m going high and right.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hang on. There are four more of them.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . .
. help me engage. Back off … Let them pass between us.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m coming around. I’m coming around on your
tail.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These
droids are all over me like a rash.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: How many back there. Artoo? Three . . . Four
. . . that’s not good.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, you have four on your tail.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know. I know!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Four more closing from your left.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know. I know!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Break right and go high.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m going low and left.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He still has much to learn.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I’m
going to pull them through the needle . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule:
“Survive.”</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin
them out a little.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Just keep me steady . . . hold on … not
yet. . . now break left.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You’ll never get through there, Anakin.
It’s too tight.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Easy, Artoo . . . we’ve done this
before.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Use the Force, think yourself through, the
ship will follow.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Wrong thought, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>odd ball</strong>: There are too many of them.</p>
<p><strong>clone pilot 2</strong>: I’m on your wing. Break left. Break
left. They’re all over me. Get them off my . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m going to go help them out!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No, no! They are doing their job so we can
do ours. Head for the Command Ship!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Missiles! Pull up!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: They overshot us . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They’re coming around!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too
fancy.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the
reverse thrusters.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We got ’em. Artoo!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Flying is for droids.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m hit! Anakin?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh dear. They’re shutting down all the
controls.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot
at them.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get
the Chancellor! I’m running out of tricks here.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: In the name of …</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Steady . . . steady . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your
fire. You’re not helping here.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease
over . . . steady . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Wait . . . wait . . . I can’t see a thing!
My cockpit’s fogging. They’re all over me, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Move to the right.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Hold on, Anakin. You’re going to get us
both killed! Get out of here. There’s nothing more you can do.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not leaving without you, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Blast it … I can’t see . . . my controls
are gone.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Get ’em, Artoo. Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Artoo, hit the buzz droid’s center eye.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yeah, you got him!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Great, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Stay on my wing . . . the General’s Command
Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up … Head for the hangar.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Have you noticed the shields are still
up?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Tap into the ship’s computers.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Chancellor’s signal is coming from
right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I sense Count Dooku . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I sense a trap.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Next move?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Spring the trap.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the
ship.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Here, take this, and wait for orders.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: What’s the situation, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar
bay.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Just as Count Dooku predicted.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard i</strong>: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We’ve
been waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor
Palpatine, not join him.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin. . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our
sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That’s why they’ve stopped
shooting.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well then, we’re safe for the time
being.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Your idea of safe is not the same as
mine.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They’re sealing this section off.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Six droids coming our way!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This
way.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We’ll never get through that. It’s too
small!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I found our escape vent.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We’re in
serious trouble here.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no
structure. . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Here’s a way out.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: That won’t hold when the fuel hits those
power dischargers.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The blast will break the hull. This side’s
pressurized.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You still have much to learn, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid r77</strong>: I have a bad feeling about
this.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: All right, you win. I have much to learn.
Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Destroyers!!</p>
<p><strong>battle droid</strong>: Drop your weapons! I said drop
’em.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Did you press the stop button?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, did you?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, there’s more than one way out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We don’t want to get out, we want to get
moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . . . .
31174 . . .</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid 1</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid 2</strong>: Get back to work. It’s
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Artoo?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Always on the move.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you
hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going
up.</p>
<p><strong>droid 1</strong>: Hands up, Jedi! Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>droid 2</strong>: Roger, roger.</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid 1</strong>: There it is again.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me?
Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop,
stop!</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid 1</strong>: Hey you!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Now, that’s better . . .</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid 1</strong>: You stupid little astro
droid!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh, it’s you . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Well, Artoo has been . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No loose wire jokes . . . He’s doing the
best he can.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Did I say anything?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He’s trying!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I didn’t say anything!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Count Dooku.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: This time we will do it together.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I was about to say that.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Get help! You’re no match for him. He’s a
Sith Lord.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our
specialty.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We
don’t want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You won’t get away this time, Dooku.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: I’ve been looking forward to this.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: My powers have doubled since the last time
we met, Count.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Good. Twice the pride, double the
fall.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too
predictable. You’ll have to do better.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.
You have hate, you have anger, but you don�t use them.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do
it. Kill him. Kill him now!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I shouldn’t . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Do it!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: … I couldn’t stop myself.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You did well, Anakin. He was too
dangerous to be kept alive.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I shouldn’t have done that, Chancellor. It’s
not the Jedi way.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge. It wasn’t the first time, Anakin. Remember what
you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave
before more security droids arrive.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin, there is no time. We must get off
the ship before it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He seems to be all right. No broken bones,
breathing’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Leave him, or we’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: His fate will be the same as ours.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Prepare for attack.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: All batteries fire! Fire!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The elevator’s not working, Artoo . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: . . . Activate Elevator 3224.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Artoo … do you copy? Artoo, come in!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Reverse stabilizers.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Magnetize! Magnetize!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We can’t wait. Come on, we have to be
fast.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Fire the emergency booster
engines.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Leveling out, sir.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Easy. . . . We’re in a bit of a
situation.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Did I miss something?</p>
<p><strong>anakinn</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Too late! Jump!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Let’s see if we can find something in the
hangar bay that’s still flyable. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you
copy?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: None of those ships will get us
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t look at me. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your
waist, and hold on.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We’ll head toward the bridge and see if we
can find an escape pod.</p>
<p><strong>anakin/obi-wan</strong>: Well, that was close.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: General, we found the Jedi. They’re in
hallway 328.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Activate ray shields.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Ray shields!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Wait a minute, how’d this happen! We’re
smarter than this.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest
trap in the book . . . Well … I was distracted.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh, so all of a sudden it’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re the Master. I’m just a hero.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m open to suggestions here.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Why don’t we let them take us to General
Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku’s demise, we can negotiate our
release.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I say . . . patience.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Patience! That’s your plan, is it?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments
and he’ll release the ray shields . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: See! No problem.</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid</strong>: Don’t move, dummy. Ouch! Zap
this.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Do you have a plan B?</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the
Negotiator. We’ve been waiting for you. That wasn’t much of a
rescue.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: That depends upon your point of view.
Hah!</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: And Anakin Skywalker … I was
expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of
the Droid Armies. You’re shorter than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job
to do.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Your lightsabers will make a fine
addition to my collection.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Not this time. And this time you won’t
escape.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Crush them! Make them suffer!</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Stay and watch your stations.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft
control cells are dead.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Stay on course . . . Don’t bother
with them. Keep the ship in orbit.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: You lose, General Kenobi.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: The ship is breaking up!</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: We’ve run out of time.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: The hull is burning up!</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Time to abandon ship.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: All the escape pods have been launched.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like
this?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You mean, do I know how to land what’s left
of this thing?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Under the circumstances, I’d say the ability
to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen
degrees.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Pressure rising. We’ve got to slow this
wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended,
drag fins . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We lost something.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Not to worry, we’re still flying half the
ship.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Now we’re really picking up speed . . . I’m
going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Careful . . . we’re heating up-twelve
thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What’s our speed?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus
sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . .
we’re in the atmosphere . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Grab that . . . Keep us level.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Steady. Steady.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little
rough. We lost our heat shields.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two
thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Copy that. Landing strip’s straight
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We’re coming in too hot.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Easy-easy.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Another happy landing.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Are you coming, Master?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh no. I’m not brave enough for politics. I
have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster
boy.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea.
You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to
take the bows this time.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that
you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you
rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you
managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: All because of your training, Master. You
deserve all those speeches of your greatness.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin,
let’s be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for
saving your skin for the tenth time . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato
Nemoidia doesn’t count. I’ll see you at the briefing.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights.
They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once
again.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku
dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate
will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise
you enough.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping
was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan
and I were able to take advantage of.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: It couldn’t possibly be as bad as all
that.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I
could do with a tune-up myself.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: The end of Count Dooku will surely
bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor’s draconian
security measures.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I wish that were so, but the fighting is
going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The
Chancellor is very clear about that.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: I’ll do everything I can with the
Senate.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I missed you, Padme. I’ve missed you so.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: There were whispers . . . that you’d been
killed. I’ve been living with unbearable dread.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m back, I’m all right. It feels like we’ve
been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been … If the Chancellor
hadn’t been kidnapped. I don’t think they would have ever brought us
back from the Outer Rim sieges.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Wait, not here . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, here! I’m tired of all this deception.
I don’t care if they know we’re married.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, don’t say things like that. You’re
important to the Republic … to ending this war. I love you more than
anything, but I won’t let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . .
.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve given my life to the Jedi order, but
I’d only give up my life, for you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I wouldn’t like that. I wouldn’t like that
one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Are you all right? You’re trembling. What’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m just excited to see you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That’s not it. I sense more . . . what is
it?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Nothing . . . nothing . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re frightened. Tell me what’s going
on!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’ve been gone five months . . . it’s been
very hard for me. I’ve never felt so alone. There’s . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: . . . Is there someone else?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy
upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still
don’t trust me. Nothing has changed.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only
fear is losing you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It’s just that I’ve never seen you like this
. . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Something wonderful has happened.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m . . . Annie, I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That’s . . . that’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We’re not going to worry about anything
right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid g21</strong>: The planet is secure, sir.
The population is under control.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Good. Where is the Separatist
Council?</p>
<p><strong>super battle droid g21</strong>: This way, sir …</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Yes, Lord Sidious.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: It will be done, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: But the loss of Count Dooku?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: . . . every second I was thinking of you.
Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture
. . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I’ve
never been so happy as I am at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on
Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . .
where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby’s room. I
know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You are so beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: It’s only because I’m so in love . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, it’s because I’m so in love with
you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: So love has blinded you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, that’s not exactly what I meant . .
.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: But it’s probably true!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I haven’t laughed in so long . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Neither have I.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love
you. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin??</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What’s bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Nothing . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I remember when I gave this to you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us
to be honest with each other?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It was a dream.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Bad?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Like the ones I used to have about my mother
just before she died.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It was about you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It was only a dream.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You die in childbirth . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: And the baby?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: It was only a dream.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: . . . I won’t let this one become real,
Padme.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I
doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if
the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the
Jedi Order.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know �.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to
help us?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Have you told him anything?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: No, but he’s your mentor, your best friend .
. . he must suspect something.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He’s been a father to me, but he’s still on
the Council. Don’t tell him anything!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I won’t, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t need his help . . . Our baby is a
blessing, not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm .
. . these visions you have . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Yourself you speak of, or someone you
know?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Someone . . .</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: . . . close to you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Careful you must be when sensing the future,
Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I won’t let these visions come true, Master
Yoda.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for
those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss
them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that
is.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What must I do, Master Yoda?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Train yourself to let go of everything you
fear to lose.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You missed the report on the Outer Rim
sieges.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m sorry, I was held up. I have no
excuse.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: In short, they are going very well.
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz
Pity.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What’s wrong then?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the Chancellor today.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this
war.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, be careful of your friend
Palpatine.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Be careful of what?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He has requested your presence.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He would not say.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He didn’t inform the Jedi Council? That’s
unusual, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: All of this is unusual, and it’s making me
feel uneasy. You’re probably aware that relations between the Council
and the Chancellor are stressed.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know the Council has grown wary of the
Chancellor’s power, mine also for that matter. Aren’t we all working
together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are
all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is
going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Jedi will no longer report to the
Senate?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: They will report to me . . . personally.
The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick
end to things.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it
that way.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: There are times when we must all endure
adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in
no mood for more constitutional amendments.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I
have no choice . . . this war must be won.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Everyone will agree on that.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin, I’ve known you since you were a
small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could … I am very
proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi
Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust
me, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I need your help, son.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps
pushing for more control. They’re shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with
maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible
in a democracy.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated
to the values of the Republic, sir.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Nevertheless, their actions will speak
more loudly than their words. I’m depending on you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: For what? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the
Republic . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin . . . I’m appointing you to be my
personal representative on the Jedi Council.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the
Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I think they will . . . they need you
more than you know.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Now that he has control of the Jedi
Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star
systems in the Republic.</p>
<p><strong>fang zar</strong>: When did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: The decree was posted this morning.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Do you think he will dismantle the
Senate?</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: Why bother? As a practical matter, the
Senate no longer exists.</p>
<p><strong>giddean danu</strong>: The constitution is in shreds.
Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen
in one day.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: We can’t let a thousand years of
democracy disappear without a fight.</p>
<p><strong>terr taneel</strong>: What are you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: I apologize. I didn’t mean to sound
like a Separatist.</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: We are not Separatists trying to leave
the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the
Republic.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: It has become increasingly clear to
many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I can’t believe it has come to this!
Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my
Ambassador when I was Queen.</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: The Chancellor has played the Senators
well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes
to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him
to do it.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: We can’t sit around debating any
longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma
and I are putting together an organization . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At
this point, it’s better to leave some things unsaid.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss
this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: That means those closest to you . . .
even family … no one can be told.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your
appointment to the Council as the Chancellor’s personal
representative.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I will do my best to uphold the principles
of the Jedi Order.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council
does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You are on this Council, but we do not grant
you the rank of Master.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What? ! How can you do this?? This is
outrageous, it’s unfair . . . I’m more powerful than any of you. How can
you be on the Council and not be a Master?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Take a seat, young Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Forgive me, Master.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The
outlying systems, you must sweep.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It may take some time . . . we do not have
many ships to spare.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: We cannot take ships from the front line.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow
the droid armies to regroup.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must,
and then wait.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: It is critical we send an attack group there,
immediately!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He’s right, that is a system we cannot
afford to lose. It’s the main navigation route for the southwestern
quadrant.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know that system well. It would take us
little time to drive the droids off that planet.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the
Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees,
I have.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion
of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with
us all.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the
Council and not make me a Master!?? That’s never been done in the
history of the Jedi. It’s insulting!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a
great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It’s never happened
before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you’re too close
to the Chancellor. The Council doesn’t like it when he interferes in
Jedi affairs.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I swear to you, I didn’t ask to be put on
the Council . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: But it’s what you wanted! Your friendship
with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That has nothing to do with this.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you
find yourself in a delicate situation.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You mean divided loyalties.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I warned you there was tension between the
Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn’t you listen? You
walked right into it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Council is upset I’m the youngest to
ever serve.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you
speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They’re
dangerous, dark thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master, you of all people should have
confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I hope so . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I sense there’s more to this talk than
you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, the only reason the Council has
approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn’t
want to see you put in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What situation?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Council wants you to report on all of
the Chancellor’s dealings. They want to know what he’s up to.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They want me to spy on the Chancellor?
That’s treason!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is
sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor
does not.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Why didn’t the Council give me this
assignment when we were in session?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: This assignment is not to be on record. The
Council asked me to approach you on this personally.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He
befriended me. He’s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our
allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay
in office long after his term has expired.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay
longer.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re asking me to do something against the
Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend.
That’s what’s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Council is asking you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin did not take to his assignment with
much enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he
is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: It’s very dangerous, putting them together. I
don’t think the boy can handle it. I don’t trust him.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He’ll be all right. I trust him with my
life.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I wish I did.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: With all due respect, Master, is he not the
Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the
Force?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: So the prophecy says.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: A prophecy . . . that misread could have
been.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He will not let me down. He never has.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: I hope right you are. And now destroy the
Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: Rest well. My Lady.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’ll be up in a while.</p>
<p><strong>motee</strong>: Yes, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Is there anything I might do for you, my
lady?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Yes, make sure all the security droids are
working. Thank you, Threepio.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Beautiful, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You startled me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He keeps kicking.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He?! Why do you think it’s a boy?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: My motherly intuition.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it’s got to
be a girl.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I’m
so proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I may be on the Council, but . . . they
refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Patience. In time, they will recognize your
skills.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan
learner. . . they fear my power, that’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sometimes, I wonder what’s happening to the
Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the
Republic.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Have you ever considered that we may be on
the wrong side?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What if the democracy we thought we were
serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we
have been fighting to destroy?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t believe that. And you’re sounding
like a Separatist!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, this war represents a failure to
listen . . . Now, you’re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please,
please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a
motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I’m not your
errand boy. I’m not anyone’s errand boy!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Don’t do this . . . don’t shut me out. Let me
help you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You can’t help me . . . I’m trying to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I sense . . . there are things you are not
telling me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I sense there are things you are not telling
me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on
Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love … No
politics, no plotting … no war.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good
news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of
General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: At last, we’ll be able to capture that
monster and end this war.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I would worry about the collective wisdom
of the Council if they didn’t select you for this assignment. You are
the best choice by far � but, they can’t always be trusted to do the
right thing.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They try.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Sit down, Leave us.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin, you know I’m not able to rely on
the Jedi Council. If they haven’t included you in their plot, they soon
will.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not sure I understand.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You must sense what I have come to
suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . .
they’re planning to betray me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t think . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin, search your feelings. You know,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know they don’t trust you . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . .
or democracy for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I have to admit my trust in them has been
shaken.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Why? They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: They asked you to spy on me, didn’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t know … I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Remember back to your early teachings.
Anakin. “All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.” Even the
Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Jedi use their power for good.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the
Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith
believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the
Jedi to be. . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: . . . evil.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: . . . from a Jedi’s point of view. The
Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest
for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not
afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more
powerful.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Sith rely on their passion for their
strength. They think inward, only about themselves.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: And the Jedi don’t?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care
about others.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Or so you’ve been trained to believe. Why
is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not sure it’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi
code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider
their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing
power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth
Plagueis “the wise”?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi
would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of
the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence
the midi-chlorians to create life … He had such a knowledge of the dark
side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He could actually save people from
death?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: The dark side of the Force is a pathway
to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: He became so powerful . . . the only
thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of
course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he
knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it
coming. It’s ironic he could save others from death, but not
himself.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Is it possible to learn this power?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Not from a Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: How could the Chancellor have come by this
information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron
Papanoida and he said no one was there.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: A partial message was intercepted in a
diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Act on this, we must. The capture of General
Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should
proceed.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Does everyone agree?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the
campaign.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: The Council will make up its own mind who is
to go, not the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: A Master is needed, with more experience.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Given our resources, I recommend we send only
one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He was not so successful the last time he
met Grievous.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No offense, my Master, but I’m only stating
a fact.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh no, you’re quite right, but I do have
the most experience with his ways of combat.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Obi-Wan, my choice is.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Very well. Council is adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly
as you can. If this report is true, there’s no telling how many battle
droids he may have with him.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander gree</strong>: The droids have started up
their main power generators.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Then now the time is, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander gree</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Has Anakin been to see you?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he
was accepted on the Jedi Council.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I know … he deserves it. He is impatient,
strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re not just here to say hello. Something
is wrong, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You should be a Jedi, Padme.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re not very good at hiding your
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s Anakin . . . He’s becoming moody and
detached. He’s been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor’s
representative . . . but I think it’s more than that. I was hoping he
may have talked to you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Why would he talk to me about his work?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Neither of you is very good at hiding your
feelings either.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Don’t give me that look.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I know how he feels about you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Nothing. He didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I know you both too well. I can see you two
are in love. Padme, I’m worried about him.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I fear your relationship has confused him.
He’s changed considerably since we returned . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Padme, I’m not telling the Council about
any of this. I … I hope I didn’t upset you. We’re all friends, I care
about both of you . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Thank you, Obi-Wan.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Please do what you can to help him.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: We cannot let this turn into another war.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Absolutely, that is the last thing we
want.</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: We are hoping to form an alliance in the
Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to
consult.</p>
<p><strong>bana breemu</strong>: That would be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: We don’t know where the Jedi stand in
all this.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I only wish to discuss this with one . . .
one I trust.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: The Jedi aren’t any happier with the
situation than we are . . .</p>
<p><strong>chi eekway</strong>: Patience, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>fang zar</strong>: We have so many Senators on our side,
surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>bana breemu</strong>: When you present the “petition of the
two thousand” to the Chancellor, things may change.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Let us see what we can accomplish in
the Senate, before we include the Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re going to need me on this one,
Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just
to be a wild bantha chase.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master, I’ve disappointed you. I have not
been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I
apologize . . . I’ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your
friendship means everything to me.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am
very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have
taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than
I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won’t be long before the
Council makes you a Jedi Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t worry. I have enough clones with me
to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I’ll be able to handle
the situation . . . even without your help.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, there’s always a first time.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: Fortunately, most of the
cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far
side.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’ll keep them distracted until you get
there. Just don’t take too long.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: Come on, boss, when have I
ever let you down?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: That was Anakin who was late.
I believe.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Very well, the burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids before you get there.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: I’m counting on you.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend
off?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He will soon have Grievous’s head.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: We can only hope the Council didn’t make
a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Council was very sure in its
decision.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . .
.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hi, Jar Jar.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your
Highness, sir.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: There are rumors in the Senate about
Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: They say his mind has become fogged by
the influence of a certain female Senator.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That’s ridiculous. Who?!?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: No one knows who she is … only that she
is a Senator.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That’s impossible. I would know.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Sometimes the closest are the ones who
cannot see.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and
never accurate. I’m sure your Master will do fine.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Save your energy.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t give up, Padme. Don’t give up . .
.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan’s
been here, hasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He came by this morning.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He’s worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You told him about us, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He’s your best friend, Anakin. He says you’re
under a lot of stress.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: And he’s not?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You have been moody lately.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not moody . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin! Don’t do this again.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t know … I feel . . . lost.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Lost? What do you mean? You’re always so sure
of yourself. I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Obi-Wan and the Council don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan
loves you as a son.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Something’s happening . . . I’m not the Jedi
I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I’m not satisfied …
I want more, and I know I shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You expect too much of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I have found a way to save you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Save me?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: From my nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Is that what’s bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I won’t lose you, Padme.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I
promise you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful
with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from
dying.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You don’t need more power, Anakin. I believe
you can protect me against anything, just as you are.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Unfortunately, the war.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: With your kind permission, I should like
some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for
General Grievous.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Tell your people to take shelter. If you
have warriors, now is the time.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship.
I’m staying here. Tell Cody I’ve made contact.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: What was his name?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I need transportation.</p>
<p><strong>wrangler</strong>: You need transportation.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Get it for me.</p>
<p><strong>wrangler</strong>: I will get it for you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: This one.</p>
<p><strong>wrangler</strong>: Boga. She answers to Boga.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Good girl, Boga.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: It won’t be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal
of scanning interference. You will be safe there.</p>
<p><strong>nute gunray</strong>: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to
escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your
ability to keep us safe.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Hello, there!</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: General Kenobi, you are a bold
one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you’re
doomed, Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Enough of this.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Back away. I will deal with this
Jedi slime myself.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Your move.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: You fool. I have been trained in
your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated
Count Dooku!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops
certainly will.</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Army or not, you must realize you
are doomed.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I understand your reservations
completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will
in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: May I take it then, that there will be no
further amendments to the Constitution?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I want this terrible conflict to end as
much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate
return to democracy . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the
war, then.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You must trust me to do the right things,
Senator. That is why I am here.</p>
<p><strong>fangzar</strong>: But surely . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I have said I will do what is right, that
should be enough for your . . . committee.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: On behalf of the “delegation of two
thousand,” I thank you, Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I thank you for bringing this to my
attention, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Their sincerity is to be admired,
although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling
us.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: They are not to be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . .
.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: These are unstable times for the
Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator
Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m sure you’re mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I’m surprised your Jedi insights are not
more sensitive to such things.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I simply don’t sense betrayal in Senator
Amidala.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Yes, you do, but you don’t seem to want
to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: Master Windu, may I interrupt?
General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun
our attack.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The
dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: To a dark place this line of thought will
carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Chancellor, we have just received a report
from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up
to the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I should be there with him.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: It is upsetting to me to see that the
Council doesn’t seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don’t you wonder
why they won’t make you a Jedi Master?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I wish I knew. More and more I get the
feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are
things about the Force that they are not telling me.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: They don’t trust you, Anakin. They see
your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin,
you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you.
Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: How do you know the ways of the Force?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: My mentor taught me everything about the
Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You know the dark side?!?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin, if one is to understand the great
mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow
view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you
must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.
They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I won’t be a pawn in your political game.
The Jedi are my family.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Only through me can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin,
and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re a Sith Lord!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I know what has been troubling you . . .
Listen to me. Don’t continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever
since I’ve known you, you’ve been searching for a life greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re wrong!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Are you going to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I would certainly like to.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I know you would. I can feel your anger.
It gives you focus, makes you stronger.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi
Council.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Of course you should. But you’re not sure
of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting
to take over the Republic?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I will quickly discover the truth of all
this.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the
power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I am not going anywhere. You have time to
decide my fate. Perhaps you’ll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy
for the good of all . . .</p>
<p><strong>general grievous</strong>: Prepare to move out of orbit. I
will be up in a few moments.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: So uncivilized . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master Windu, I must talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He won’t give up his power. I’ve just
learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith
Lord.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: A Sith Lord?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes. The one we have been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been
trained to use the dark side.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You
will need my help if you are going to arrest him.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I must go, Master.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You do know, don’t you, if the Jedi
destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I
want you to know.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I can’t do this … I can’t let her die.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then. I must say, you’re here sooner than
expected.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: In the name of the Galactic Senate of
the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: The Senate will decide your fate.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I am the Senate!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Not yet!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: It’s treason, then.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: You are under arrest, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Anakin! I told you it would come to this.
I was right. The Jedi are taking over.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: No! No! You will die!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: He is a traitor, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in
revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don’t
let him kill me.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I am your pathway to power. I have the
power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Help me! Don’t let him kill me. I can’t
hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I can’t … I give up. Help me. I am weak …
I am too weak. Don’t kill me. I give up. I’m dying. I can’t hold on any
longer.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You can’t kill him, Master. He must stand
trial.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I’m too weak. Don’t kill me. Please.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It is not the Jedi way . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He must live . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Please don’t, please don’t . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I need him . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Please don’t . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Power! Unlimited power!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin.
Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I will do whatever you ask.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Just help me save Padme’s life. I can’t live
without her. I won’t let her die. I want the power to stop death.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: To cheat death is a power only one has
achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the
secret.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the
ways of the Sith.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you.
A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth
. . . Vader.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Thank you. my Master.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Rise, Darth Vader.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Because the Council did not trust you, my
young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of
this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill
us, along with all the Senators.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I agree. The Jedi’s next move will be
against the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Every single Jedi, including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I understand, Master.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: We must move quickly. The Jedi are
relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without
end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off
balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no
mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save
Padme.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What about the other Jedi spread across the
galaxy?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After
you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system.
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the
Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them
to move to the higher levels.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: Oh, by the way, I think you’ll
be needing this.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Thank you, Cody, Now let’s get a move on.
We’ve got a battle to win here.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: It will be done, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander cody</strong>: Blast him!</p>
<p><strong>clone commander bacara</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander bacara</strong>: It will be done, My
Lord.</p>
<p><strong>aayla</strong>: Steady. . . . steady . . .</p>
<p><strong>aayla</strong>: Bly, do you think they’re Droids?</p>
<p><strong>bly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Execute Order Sixty-Six.</p>
<p><strong>clone pilot</strong>: It will be done, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>plo koon</strong>: There they are. Land on the nearest
platform.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander gree</strong>: Yes, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>dabth sidious</strong>: The time has come. Execute Order
Sixty-Six.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander gree</strong>: It will be done, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>younglings</strong>: Master Skywalker, there are too many of
them. What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: The Chancellor’s office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don’t worry, My Lady. I am sure he
will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: What’s going on here?!?</p>
<p><strong>clone sergeant</strong>: There’s been a rebellion. Don’t
worry, sir, the situation is under control.</p>
<p><strong>clone sergeant</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. No one is allowed
entry.</p>
<p><strong>clone sergeant</strong>: It’s time for you to leave, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: And so it is.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander appo</strong>: Get him! Shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>at-st clone sergeant</strong>: Everyone out of there!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee.</p>
<p><strong>clone sergeant</strong>: Did you find something?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: It’s nothing, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>clone sergeant</strong>: It’s nothing, nothing. All these
Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.</p>
<p><strong>clone trooper</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will
be.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give
me.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Not far, are we, from the emergency ship.
Quickly . . .</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I
will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I
have.</p>
<p><strong>royal guard</strong>: Identification . . .</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi
homing beacon?</p>
<p><strong>captain antilles</strong>: Yes, sir. We’ve encountered no
opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in
command.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: That will change soon. Hopefully we
will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this
catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>clone captain</strong>: Did you find Kenobi?</p>
<p><strong>clone trooper</strong>: No one could have survived that
fall.</p>
<p><strong>clone captain</strong>: Start loading your men on the
ship.</p>
<p><strong>clone trooper</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen … I have no
contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere .
. .</p>
<p><strong>bail</strong>: . . . Kenobi . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’ve locked on. Repeat.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Master Kenobi??</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on
me … I need help.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It
appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We’re sending you our
coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: My Lady, there’s a Jedi fighter docking on
the veranda.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Hush! Not so loud!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Are you all right? I heard there was an
attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m fine. I’m fine. I came to see if you and
the baby are safe.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Captain Typho’s here, we’re safe. What’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: You can’t be anymore confused than I am.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The situation is not good. The Jedi have
tried to overthrow the Republic . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I can’t believe that!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I couldn’t either at first, but it’s true. I
saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Something important is going on! I heard a
rumor they are going to banish all droids.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Whatever it is, we’ll be the last to
know.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I will not betray the Republic . . . my
loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with
you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What about Obi-Wan?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t know . . . Many Jedi have been
killed. We can only hope that he’s remained loyal to the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: How could this have happened?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi
aren’t the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There
are also traitors in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You need to distance yourself from your
friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when
this conflict is over.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What if they start an inquisition? I’ve
opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That won’t happen. I won’t let it.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Oh, Anakin, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be
set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The
Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I’m going there to end
this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Please, wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Take care, my little friend.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: My Lady, is there anything I might do?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: No thank you, Threepio.</p>
<p><strong>g-3po</strong>: A snack, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: I feel so helpless.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: You made it.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to
see you. it is.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You were attacked by your Clones, also?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape,
I did.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: How many other Jedi managed to survive?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Heard from no one, have we.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: I saw thousands of troops attack the
Jedi Temple. That’s why I went looking for Yoda.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Have we had any contact from the
Temple?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Received a coded retreat message, we have.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: It requests all Jedi to return to the
Temple. It says that the war is over . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Well, then we must go back! If there are
other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: It’s too dangerous to return.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake
here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves … a
little more knowledge might light our way.</p>
<p><strong>nute gunray</strong>: The plan has gone as you had promised,
My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: You have done well, Viceroy. When my
new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We are receiving a message from the
Chancellor’s office, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Send it through.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme
Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session
of Congress.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Tell the Chancellor I will be
there.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Very well. He will be expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: It could be a trap.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No, I don’t think so. The Chancellor will
not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the
Senate intact.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: If a special session of Congress there is,
easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your
clearance?</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take
custody of the Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It would be better if we stayed with the
Senator.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: It would be better if they stayed with
you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Artoo . . . stay with the ship.</p>
<p><strong>nute gunray</strong>: Welcome, Lord Vader. We’ve been
expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: There are several battalions of Clone
Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group
back there, soon discovered will be.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been
foiled.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: I was held up. What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot
by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: That’s not true!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He’s been presenting evidence all
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: And the Senate will go along with it,
just like they always do.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down
and defeated. Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Not even the younglings survived.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a
lightsaber, he was.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: . . .Who?? Who could have done this?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: The attempt on my life has left me
scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been
stronger.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: The war is over. The Separatists have
been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the
threshold of a new beginning.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Well, this is the moment we discover if he
intends to return the Republic to a democracy.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: In order to ensure our security and
continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first
Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will
last for ten thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: An empire that will continue to be ruled
by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: An empire ruled by the majority . . .
Ruled by a new constitution . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous
applause . . .</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: We cannot let this happen.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Not now! There will be a time.</p>
<p><strong>rune haako</strong>: Stop! Enough, this is not right!</p>
<p><strong>nute gunray</strong>: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised
us peace … we only want . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’ve recalibrated the code warning all
surviving Jedi to stay away.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the
recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer
still. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Wait, Master. There is something I must
know . . .</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: If into the security recordings you go, only
pain will you find.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I must know the truth, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It can’t be . . . It can’t be . . .</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord
Sidious.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, My Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I can’t watch any more.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Destroy the Sith, we must.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not
kill Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you
are not.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He is like my brother … I cannot do it.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has
become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth
Vader.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: How could it have come to this?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: To question, no time there is.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I do not know where the Emperor has sent
him. I don’t know where to look.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you
will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it’s you,
Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Has Anakin been here . . . ?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi
Temple.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Master Kenobi . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you’re
alive.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The
Jedi Order is no more . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I know, it’s hard to believe everything to
which we’ve dedicated our lives is gone.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I believe we have been part of a plot
hundreds of years in the making.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: The Senate is still intact, there is some
hope.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No. Padme . . . It’s over . . . The Sith
now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: The Sith!?!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m here looking for Anakin . . . When was
the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: And do you know where he is now?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Padme, I need your help. He’s in grave
danger.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: From the Sith?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned
to the dark side.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re wrong! How could you even say
that?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I have seen a security hologram of him
killing younglings.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Not Anakin! He couldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It
appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war.
Palpatine is the Sith Lord we’ve been looking for. After the death of
Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I don’t believe you … I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Padme, I must find him.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re going to kill him, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He has become a very great threat.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I can’t . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin is the father, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: My Lady, let me come with you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and
. . . this is personal.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I
strongly disagree.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’ll be all right, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: This is something I must do myself. Besides,
Threepio will look after me.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Green light. Do you know that I think I’m
beginning to get the hang of this flying business.</p>
<p><strong>darth vader</strong>: The Separatists are taken care of, My
Master.</p>
<p><strong>darth vader</strong>: Thank you, My Master.</p>
<p><strong>darth vader</strong>: Very good, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Padme, I saw your ship . . .</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Oh, Anakin!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It’s all right, you’re safe now. What are
you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me
terrible things.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He said you have turned to the dark side . .
. that you killed younglings.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against
me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He cares about us.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Us??!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He knows . . . He wants to help you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can’t …
he can’t help you. He’s not strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, all I want is your love.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Love won’t save you, Padme. Only my new
powers can do that.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: At what cost? You are a good person. Don’t do
this.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I won’t lose you the way I lost my mother!
I’ve become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I’ve
done it for you. To protect you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Come away with me. Help me raise our child.
Leave everything else behind while we still can.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t you see, we don’t have to run away
anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than
the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the
galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I don’t believe what I’m hearing . . .
Obi-Wan was right. You’ve changed.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.
The Jedi turned against me. Don’t you turn against me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I don’t know you anymore. Anakin, you’re
breaking my heart. I’ll never stop loving you, but you are going down a
path I can’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Because of Obi-Wan?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Because of what you’ve done . . . what you
plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Liar!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re with him. You’ve betrayed me! You
brought him here to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: NO! Anakin. I swear … I …</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Let her go, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What have you and she been up to?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You turned her against me.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You have done that yourself.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You will not take her from me.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Your anger and your lust for power have
already done that.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist
your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you
swore to destroy.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the
lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought
peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Your new Empire?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t make me kill you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic …
to democracy.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: If you’re not with me, you’re my enemy.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will
do what I must.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You will try.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or
should I call you Darth Sidious.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: What are you doing? You’re going to hurt her.
Wait!!</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord
Sidious.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: At an end your rule is and not short enough it
was, I must say.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: If so powerful you are, why leave??</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may
be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t make me destroy you, Master. You’re no
match for the dark side.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’ve heard that before, Anakin . . . but I
never thought I’d hear it from you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The flaw of power is arrogance.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You hesitate . . . the flaw of
compassion.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi,
your apprentice will destroy.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Hurry. Careful timing we will need.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: There aren’t many troops on this side.
Activate your homing beacon when you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander thire</strong>: There is no sign of his body,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Then he is not dead.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Double your search.</p>
<p><strong>clone commander thire</strong>: Yes sir. Right away, sir.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: I am being careful. I’ve got a good hold on
her, but . . . I’m worried about my back. I hope it’s able to hold up
under this weight.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able
to teach you to think.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I should have known the Jedi were plotting
to take over . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor
Palpatine is evil.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: From the Jedi point of view! From my point
of view, the Jedi are evil.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Well, then you are lost!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish
it were otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s over, Anakin. I have the high
ground.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You underestimate my power!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t try it.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said
that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would
bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved
you.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board.
Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He’s
still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.</p>
<p><strong>clone captain</strong>: Yes sir. Right away.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still
much to learn, there is …</p>
<p><strong>qui -gon</strong>: Patience. You will have time. I did not.
When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my
training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your
physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your
consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Eternal consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The ability to defy oblivion can be
achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the
Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: . . . to become one with the Force, and
influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You will learn to let go of everything. No
attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon
Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi
has made contact.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: We’ll take her to the medical center,
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: Medically, she is completely healthy.
For reasons we can’t explain, we are losing her.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: She’s dying?</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: We don’t know why. She has lost the
will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the
babies.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Babies??!!</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: She’s carrying twins.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Save them, we must. They are our last
hope.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: It s some kind of reproductive process, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t give up, Padme.</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: It’s a boy.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Luke . . .</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: … and a girl.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: . . . Leia.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You have twins, Padme They need you . . .
hang on.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I can’t . . .</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Save your energy.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I
know there is … still . . .</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: My Lord, the construction is finished
… he lives.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Good. Good.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Lord Vader, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>darth vader</strong>: Yes, My Master.</p>
<p><strong>darth vader</strong>: Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all
right?</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: I’m afraid she died. … it seems in
your anger, you killed her.</p>
<p><strong>darth vader</strong>: I couldn’t have! She was alive! I felt
her! She was alive! It’s impossible! No!!!</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe,
the children must be kept.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We must take them somewhere the Sith will
not sense their presence.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Split up, they should be.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: My wife and I will take the girl. We’ve
always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: And what of the boy?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I will take the child and watch over him.
Master Yoda, do you think Anakin’s twins will be able to defeat Darth
Sidious?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line.
Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we
will.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude
on Tatooine, training I have for you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Training??</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: An old friend has learned the path to
immortality.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: One who has returned from the netherworld of
the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish
this?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills,
he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I will be able to talk with him?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your
consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your
physical self, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Captain Antilles.</p>
<p><strong>captain antilles</strong>: Yes, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: I’m placing these droids in your care.
Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid’s mind
wiped.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
