<h1 id="bamboozled">bamboozled</h1>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: You’ve been hoodwinked. You’ve been had.
You’ve been took. You’ve been led astray, run amok. You’ve been
bamboozled.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Satire. 1a. A literary work in which
human vice or folly is ridiculed or attacked scornfully. B. The branch
of literature that composes such work. 2. Irony, derision or caustic wit
used to attack or expose folly, vice or stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Bonjour, my name is Pierre Delacroix. I’m
a television writer, also a showrunner, a creative person.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’m one of those people responsible for
what you view on your idiot box.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The problem is not enough of you have
been watching.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: With the onslaught of the internet, video
and interactive games, nine hundred channels to choose from and whatnot,
our valued audience has dramatically eroded.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: To put it in much more simple terms…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Like rats fleeing a sinking ship.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: People tuning out by the millions.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Which is not good.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Yo, let’s get to it. You don’t dance, we
don’t eat. Simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: That’s right. We slow. We blow. We snooze.
We lose.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I know
everybody is in a hurry to work, ready to begin another day in this rat
race. But don’t sleep us. I’m Cheeba and I introduce to you the world
renown MANRAY, the man with the educated feet.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: As we continue our world wind tour, we would
like to give you a little somethin’, somethin’ before you go off to make
that money. I give you Manray.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Thank you very much but please don’t go
without giving us some cheddar, cheese, money. We prefer two’s than
fews.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I would like to add that both of us are
homeless. Not that it means anything.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I said homeless. Ladies and gentlemen.
Senorita, do you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Muchos gracias.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Good morning, Cheeba.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: De-la-croix.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Y’know what I mean. Got a gig yet for Manray
and I yet?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Gracias.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Manray, Sloan says you’re too talented to
be dancing on the street.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Well do something about it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Good morning, Marie.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: It’s not gonna be a good morning for you if
you don’t get into Dunwitty’s staff meeting.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What staff meeting?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: The staff meeting that started 30 minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Monsieur Delacroix, this very important
meeting commenced…</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: …exactly thirty-two minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Do you know how much information can be
dispensed in one minute alone?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I didn’t find out about this very
important staff meeting until…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Four minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: So are you telling me everyone knew about
this get-together except you?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I wasn’t told about this until Marie
informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: People, you can attempt to pull a Rodman
like our friend Delacroix, but I guarantee you’ll be sent packing just
like him.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: These are the standings. Read ’em and
weep. As you can plainly see the Continental Network System is
languishing.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Look at ’em people. We are BOOTY, CA CA.
We are DOO-DOO. Doo-doo on a stick, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I do not like to be the laughing stock of
the broadcast industry. I have pride and people, you better start
getting some too. These numbers have to go up.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Question?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: So what do you want us to do?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: What I want everyone to do is write some
material that is FUNNY. The junk you’ve been writing is about as funny
as a dead baby. It’s not funny, it’s not new. It’s not sexy. It, it,
it…</p>
<p><strong>fish</strong>: Sucks.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: SUCKS. Thank you, Fish. This meeting is
over but I want everyone to seriously think about what I said and how
you can deliver.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Monsieur Delacroix, in my office now.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me about this staff
meeting?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Nobody told me anything.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What good are you if you don’t tell me
stuff like this?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: It wasn’t my fault. If I would have known, I
would have known.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Do you know what C.P. Time is?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: C.P. Time is Colored People’s Time. The
stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late. That Negroes have no
sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Let’s sit down over there.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m sorry about my blowup but I have to
have a whipping boy every meeting.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I understand. But again, in all honesty I
was not informed.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Forget it. I believe you’re my most
creative person I’ve got on staff. You’re hip. You know what’s
happening. I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I understand Black culture. I grew up
around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know
“niggers” better than you, Monsieur Delacroix. Please don’t get offended
by my use of the quote-unquote N word. I got a black wife and three
bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word. I don’t
give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right. Nigger is just a word.
If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I would prefer you not use that word in
my presence.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Say it again. C’mon, say it again.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Who’s a nigger now?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: The material you’ve been creating is too
white bread. White people with black faces. The Huxtable’s, Cosby,
revolutionary. But that’s dead. We can’t go down that road again.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I don’t agree. The Negro middle class
does exist, and it’s rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m telling you it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: The middle class black family moves into a
white suburban enclave. The middle class black family moves into a small
Southern town that is run by the KKK. The middle class single black
father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black father
raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black mother raises
her teenage son. And so on and so forth. It’s too clean, too
antiseptic…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: …to white? I still feel all of my scripts
would make good shows.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The
reason why they didn’t get picked up was because nobody - and I mean
NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’ve never been given a fair shot.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: You got your head stuck up your ass with
your Harvard education and your pretentious ways. Brother man, I’m
blacker than you. I’m keepin’ it real and you’re frontin’, trying to be
white.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’m an oreo, a sell out? Because I don’t
aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM</p>
<p><strong>out of space, secret diary of</strong>: DESMOND PFEIFFER, A
PJ’s or some as you might put it, some “nigger” show? I’m a Tom? I’m
whiter than white and you’re blacker than black? Is that what you
think?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: That’s exactly what I think. I want you to
create something that people want to see. Let’s be honest, the majority
of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I’m including
35 million African-Americans. You know and I know “niggers” set the
trend, set the styles. This is a golden opportunity now. These idiots
have to be led to the water.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’m not sure if I can deliver what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: You will or you’ll be back at BET so quick
you’ll never know what hit you. I need a mid-season replacement and
pronto. It will be on the fast track.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What is it you want from me? Some
plantation follies? Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?
Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and
crackheads? You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Yes! Yes! Yes! I want a show that will
make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned
in, glued to their televisions every week. I want advertisers dying to
buy on this show. I’m gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills
you.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I’m starvin’ like Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: My world famous, famous world Arroz con
pollo will be ready very soon.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Did we get our bill yet?</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I guess that will come with the rent, gas,
and Con Ed bills, too.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Ahh, the luxuries of life.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Yo, check it. This is good and all that but
one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and
pay all my bills. You hear me.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Chill, I’m the brains behind this
outfit.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: And I’m the feet.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want
me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you’re an overnight sensation.
Son, there is no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I’m tired of waiting.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I was never good at performing under the
gun.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Well, this wasn’t a gun, it was a bazooka
and it was pressed dead blank right against my dome.</p>
<p><strong>off-screen, we hear a ruckus, a big commotion.
voices</strong>: yelling. Police sirens, cars and trucks.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Oh snap! It’s a raid!</p>
<p><strong>police chief</strong>: Please evacuate this building. All of
you are illegal residents of this condemned building. Please leave
immediately, by order of the Mayor of New York City, Rudolph
Giuliani.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Not this way. Out through the fire
escape.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: My tap shoes.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Oh my God!!!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Manray!</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Manray!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: It hit me like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How can this be? You and me at the same
time, the exact same thought. It’s scary.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The idea was out there in the universe. Now
what?</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: We ran out without my shoes and the floor. I
gotta get my stuff. What about our savings?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Are you crazy? The joint is crawling with
cops now. You wanna go to Rikers? Go to the hoosegow?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Manray was under our nose the whole
time.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Do you know how you will use him?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Not yet, but this thing will never get
made.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You lost me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Dunwitty wants a Coon show. And that’s
what I’m going to give him, it’s going to be so racist, so negative, he
won’t have the balls to put it on the air. Hence I’ll prove my
point.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What point is that?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The point being that him, the networks
don’t want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Sounds risky to me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You getting cold feet?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’m in till the end.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Good. I’m going to need your support.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Can’t you just quit? Walk away?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And lose out on my money? The only way I
get paid is if I get fired. And that’s what I intend to do.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Everything was going according to plan. I
was working on the outline. Dunwitty was off my back for now.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: But there was a catch. A big catch.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Manray and Cheeba were nowhere to be
found.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It was like they had disappeared off the
face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I had no contact numbers, no address, no
beeper.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: No nuthin’, no clues…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Maybe something happened to them. Maybe
they’re lying in an alley bleed to death.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Manray better not be bleeding to death. I
need him. After we’re done he can do whatever he wants to do, until
then, he’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You’re beginning to sound like Dunwitty.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: His name is Delapoint.</p>
<p><strong>security guard #1</strong>: WE have no one by that name.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Delapot. Dela-something.</p>
<p><strong>security guard #2</strong>: De La Soul ain’t here either.
Let’s go. Out. Off the premises.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Sloan! She knows us.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: It’s alright. They are associates of
Mr. Delacroix.</p>
<p><strong>security guard #1</strong>: Sorry, Ms. Hopkins. They both
walked in off the street without an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>security guard #2</strong>: Do you need an escort?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That won’t be needed.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Eureka! Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Sloan and I have been looking all over
for you.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: You’d take no offense if we called you DeLa
for short?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: No offense.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Manray needs a job.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: We got evicted from our home. We’ve both
been on the streets for the last week.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: We was coming to see you.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: If it’s not too much trouble could you order
us some food?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: We’re starving.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I apologize. What would you like to eat?
Anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I have this concept for a TV pilot.
There’s no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you’ll still make
some money.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: First things first. I have to know if
Manray is up for this.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: What do I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Some tap dancing, some singing.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Where do I sign?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: What kind of show is this gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Different.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: How different?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch
it to my boss, but we’ll have an answer one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: DeLa, I’m aboard. As long as I get to hoof
and get paid too!!!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That’s right. Money turns the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: What about in the mean time? Not the in
between time?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You’ll both get an advance and you can
stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Bet.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I would like to change your name.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: To what?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You’re now Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Mantan? I don’t even care as long as I’m
dancing. Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I never had a really real pair before.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You’ve never had any formal training,
either?</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff
up by myself.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I wish I had your natural talent. God only
makes that visit once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: You sing and dance?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: A little. I just graduated from NYU film
school. Cinema studies.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: So what’s up with you and DeLa?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots.
Y’knowwhatI’mtalkin’bout.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: No, we’re not knocking boots. I got this
internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up
and go and hired me to be his assistant.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I’m sure that was the only thing he was
impressed with. You look beautiful like that.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: If that was suppose to be a compliment, I
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: You’re welcome. You shouldn’t give up on
performing.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Why do you say that? You’ve never seen
me.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I think that would probably make you the
happiest. When I’m hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it,
nothing compares to that feeling in the world.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I envy you. That’s the way I want to feel
about my work.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Li’l Sister.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You idiot. You almost gave me a massive
coronary.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: I didn’t mean to scare you like that.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Well you did.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Give me some?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’m not huggin’ you in the middle of the
street. You must be crazy, Julius.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Whoa, hold up li’l sis’. I done told you
’bout that. Julius ain’t my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our
slave name. My true name is…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’m not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy
and Daddy named you Julius.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is
the last.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Damn, Sis, you don’t keep no food up in
here in dis’ piece.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I order out mostly. So what do I owe this
visit to?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: My group we need some exposure. Was
wondering if you could hook a brother up?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Hook you up? The Mau-Mau’s? You must be
smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black
and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: So now I see where you’re coming from.
Just because we ain’t rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz,
Cristal, ho’s and bitches, we’re pseudo.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Who are you revolting against?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: We’re revolting against the powers that
be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color. And
we won’t stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the
government of the U.S. of A.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: If you were really down you would get us
together with that boss of yours. What’s his name again?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Delacroix.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Yeah, him.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What makes you think he would write a show
about the Mau-Mau’s.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: C’mon, why not? The Monkees had a show.
Look at all that other junk that’s on TV. We got underground cult
following.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You don’t have the demographics.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: So are you telling me that you wouldn’t
even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting? I’m talking ‘bout
me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up,
youknowwhatI’msayin’.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’swhatI’msayin’. I’m not blowin’ my young
career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: There is a name, a term for your kind,
the likes of you. Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a
house nigga.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: If you think I’m a house nigga then that’s
your prerogative. You got your ways to affect change, I have mine. And I
would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my
house.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: My own sister throwin’ me out. I hope to
seeya later when you get ya mind right. Don’t bother letting me out.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’s mighty black of you.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Delacroix, I’m glad you got your mind
right.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It’s right and tight. Good morning, let
me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This is Cheeba.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And this is Manray.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Good. I like the names. Very
theatrical.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: We’re all happy to be here and I’m going
to paint a picture for you.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m wid it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’ve done a lot of soul searching and
once again you are right. In my previous work it’s been all surface,
superficial. I have never really dug deep. Not anymore. As Mark Twain
fully understood satire is the way. Race has always been a hot button in
this country’s history and it needs to be pushed harder. If we are ever
to live side by side in peace and harmony. It’s about promoting racial
healing.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Go on. Good so far.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I know you’re familiar with minstrel
shows. They came about at the turn of the 19th century. It was a variety
show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling
jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was
a good variety show on the air. Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Word!!!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: So let’s take this great form, this very
American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new
millennium.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: The name of the show?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m lovin’ it. You know how I know?
Because I’m getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my
sister.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m feelin’ dis’!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It will take a lot of courage and
backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air. In fact, I would
understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too
controversial.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Don’t worry about that, that’s my
department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or
dance?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I don’t know if Whoopi is the way to
go.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Are these our two stars, sitting here in
front of my nose? Which one is Mantan again?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And Cheeba is Sleep ‘n’ Eat.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: That’s a great handle.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Mantan and Sleep ’n Eat. Two real coons.
I know we’re way out there but it’s satire.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I want you take it there. All the way to
the edge and back.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Every week we follow the trials and
tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep ’n Eat. The Dusky
Duo.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: What are there character traits?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and
unlucky.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always
by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go
haywire.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: And Sleep ’n Eat is his comical
sidekick?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Yep, you guessed it.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: This could be bigger than “Amos and
Andy.”</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Protest finally forced “Amos and Andy”
off the air. Could stop us from ever getting on.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Let’em try. I will kill to make this
happen.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Negroes would be in an uproar.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: So what. We would just give the NAACP a
donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity.
So what. Earlier you said singing and dancing.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer. He
has educated feet.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Who are the other characters?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Do we have characters? How about
Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how
could we forget Aunt Jemima.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: We gonna hit ‘em wid da BOMB DICKEY on
dis’ one. What’s the setting?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: In the projects. Like Eddie Murphy’s “The
PJ’s.”</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Ya first bad move. Projects been done.
That’s one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the
urban jungle, da hood. That’s so tired. Mantan’s Millennium Minstrel
Show should be set on a plantation. In Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: And every week these Alabama porch monkeys
will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity. Make
us feel good to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I don’t know about that plantation
angle.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: What are you talkin’ ‘bout? It’s the move.
Stay wid me now. We’re movin’ fast. What does everybody else think about
this?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We’d get a lot of mail.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Mr. Dunwitty, there wouldn’t be another show
like it.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I’ve always wanted to be on television.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I like you. Sleep ’n Eat. That’s funny.
Mantan, how do you feel about performing in black face?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: As long as the hoofing is real, that I can
do my thing, I can blacken up. Let me hit it, beats and rhythms, express
myself.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Show me a little somethin’ somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Delacroix, you dug deep, deeper than
deep.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I’m gonna give you just a taste. My tap
shoes are brand new. I haven’t trained ’em yet.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms. Beats, beats,
beats. No Fred Astaire here, baby. Just rawness.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: That’swhatI’mtalkin’‘bout.
That’swhatI’mtalkin’’bout! He’s off the hiz-hook!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: We think so.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Sleep ’n Eat, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I play the straight man. I do some singing
and dancing also. I also manage Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Oh you do so?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I’m the man behind the man behind the
man.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: You da man.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: No, you da man.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m gonna run upstairs with this. If CNS
doesn’t want to do this, somebody else will have da balls to pull the
trigger. I want to thank each and every one of you. This is great,
Delacroix. I’ll get back to you later today.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Life is beginning to look up. It’s all good
in da neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: You might be right.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Why are you smiling so?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I’m not smiling.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Naw, not you. It can’t be. That hottie Sloan
Hopkins.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: It’s that bad, huh? It’s all over my
face.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: No shame in ya game. She got ya nostrils, ya
chnoz is wide open. Sloan’s what we certified ladies’ men call low
hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Certified ladies’ man, huh?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: She’s also moorish.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Moorish. Ya get a little taste of dat booty,
ya wanna get some MORE.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Seconds and thirds, too.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Sloan is all ’dat. I try her. I’m a
tri-sexual.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: You’d try anything. I got first dibs. You
get ya own stuff.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Naw, just jokin’. That’s you. That’s
you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I want you to start using the name Mantan
and not Manray if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You have to start getting into your
character.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: At the risk of sounding ignorant…</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: …don’t say a word but who is this cat Mantan
you keep talkin’ ’bout?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This is Mantan Moreland.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: He was a clown, a buffoon but he was
funny.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: That ain’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: DeLa, I don’t know ’bout this.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Gentlemen, the show, our show will be
satirical. You know what that is, don’t you? Trust me on this one.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: We might need some mo’ money behind
this.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That can be done.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Mantan?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Mantan!!</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for
this joint.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: How ’bout…</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Black Iz Black?</p>
<p><strong>double black</strong>: That’s da bomb.</p>
<p><strong>mo black</strong>: That’s gonna give me some inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>jo black</strong>: Gonna make me get my flow on.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: We should call dis da BLACK album.</p>
<p><strong>smooth black</strong>: Yo, check it out. We have never
conformed to none of the white man’s rules and regulations and later for
that ole slave owner Webster. Therefore I respectfully submit BIG BLACK
that we from now on, hence forth and whatnot spell</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: B-L-A-K, not B-L-A-C-K.</p>
<p><strong>hard black</strong>: I feel dat.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: B-L-A-K. BLAK. The darkest of all
colors, the opposite of white. A member of an African people. But check
it out, here’s where the grey people try to get slick with their
trickery. Listen to the full connotations. GLOOMY. DEPRESSING.</p>
<p><strong>blak out. blak listed. blak ball.</strong>: Need I say
more.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: B-L-A-K it is.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: You must think I’m some kind of fool.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It looks delicious.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: You hear me talkin’ to you. The only time
you come up here when something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: C’mon, Mommy, don’t start with that I’m
an ungrateful son stuff.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: I said no such thing. All I said is that
something must be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: How’s the food?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Can’t beat it with a hammer. Well, since
you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: That’s wonderful. Isn’t that what you always
wanted, a show of your own?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It was. It is. But this is a different
kind of show.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: If at first it’s not what you want, just
work that much harder, Peerless.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Mommy, please don’t call me that.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Son, Peerless is your name. Now you might be
one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless
Dothan is on your birth certificate.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I know what’s on my birth certificate.
You heard from Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: I guess he’s still on the road. What kind of
show is this? Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: To answer your question, there are a lot
of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Peerless, I didn’t raise a buffoon. We have
enough of those on television already.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Please let me know when you hear from
Daddy, get a number or something.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: I will. And good luck with your show. I hope
it’s a huge success. You’ve worked very hard. You deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I feel like somebody hit me upside da
head with a sledgehammer.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: DeLa - what’s the matter with you.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: You ain’t happy about the green light?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: People show their happiness in a lot of
different ways.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Well, homeboy, looks like he’s at a
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’m happy for all of us. It’s just we
have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Pressure? DeLa, you don’t know what the hell
real pressure is. SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin’
out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin’ to you
with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is
some pressure.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I didn’t mean it to sound like that.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: That’s the way it came out. Let me ask you
one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged
life?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Now I’m privileged?! Why? Because I
didn’t grow up on food stamps and welfare? Because I didn’t call home a
cardboard box? No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I’m proud of it,
too. Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge
of honor flat out lied to you.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: The point I’m trying to make is that this is
a blessing. It’s going to be fun doing this show and we should all look
at it that way.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Must be the pressure.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Hey, girl. This is my best friend, Jessica
Grillo. I invited her down to celebrate with us.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I’m Cheeba.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I’m Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Please, have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Sloan never told us she had friends like
you.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: In fact, we never knew she had any friends
period.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Later for you.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: She has a lot of friends</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Male?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: A lot?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I propose a toast.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: To the success of your show. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What is your problem?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: My problem is MANTAN THE NEW</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Why did you even come up with that shit if
you didn’t want it made?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It was the principle. Dunwitty had to be
enlightened. I was making a point. I take pride in my work. Plus, I
already told you I wasn’t gonna walk away from my money.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Fuck da money. Why do through all this
effort? Why? Are you looking for love from Dunwitty? For respect?
Dunwitty and his likes don’t give a goddamn about you. So now what are
you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Will you please let me in? I have to
use the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You’re gonna have to hold it in because we’re
not finished yet…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: …QUIT then.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Even if money wasn’t an issue, Dunwitty
will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What’s the chances of MANTAN being picked
up?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I wouldn’t bet against it. My Negroidal
ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Like I said, all this for some twisted,
distorted sense of principal. Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal
ass, he doesn’t respect it.</p>
<p><strong>manager’s voice</strong>: Please open this bathroom door
immediately. You are being very inconsiderate.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I strongly feel that a Negro should
direct this. This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One
misstep and we’re doing “Amos and Andy.” Only a Negro will have the
sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous
terrain.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: To hire someone solely on their ethnicity,
gender or religion is not right. It’s un-American. I will hire someone
who is most qualified for this particular job.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I was hoping to perhaps direct some
episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I want a hot, young white director. Maybe
the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You’re telling me some white boy is gonna
direct this pilot?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I just want you to meet him. Keep an open
mind.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Besides, what does he know about
Negroes?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Probably nuthin’, but that’s why it’s such
a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a
different unique perspective. A black director, y’know what he’s gonna
do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are
endless.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What are his qualifications besides being
a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: If Spielburg can direct “The Color Purple”
and “Amistad”, our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That’s exactly my point. Has he even
directed actors before in anything?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: No!!! Just meet the guy. That’s all I’m
asking. Look, I’ll even let you choose your own musical director. You
can have that.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman,
WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the
talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas
D.C. didn’t want it bad enough. Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to
kill for it? Do you want it that much.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Good morning, for those of you who don’t
know me, I’m Pierre Delacroix. I’m running things and this here is my
assistant Sloan Hopkins.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’ve never worked with any of you and
you’ve never worked with me so we’ll be starting from scratch. I’m a
fair person, a straight shooter and I don’t hold my tongue. Everybody up
in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I would have preferred at least one other
Negro writer. Any questions? Comments?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Yes, your name?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: He, I’m Mona.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Hi, Mona.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I perfectly understand where you’re coming
from. As a minority I can relate to your struggle also. But I think you
should give us all a chance. We want this pilot to be successful just as
much as you. Please don’t be so quick to judge us based only on our
whiteness.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Oh, is that what I’m doing?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I think because of our background we can bring
a unique perspective to Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: A fresh pair of eyes. A new look, insight, new
angle that hasn’t been seen before.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’ve heard this somewhere before.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My name is David. I do think it would be
better to have some African-American writers but for whatever reason
they are not here. I don’t know if they couldn’t find any people with
experience, they wouldn’t work for the pay or refused to work for the
show. I don’t know and nobody in this room probably knows either. I’m
looking at this as a unique opportunity. We all should. I’m a damn good
writer and I’m ready to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This thing was rigged, the deck was
stacked, the fix was in. Could Don King be near? Good thing Sloan had my
back. She’s my rock. This was going to be a whole lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: David, I appreciate your comments.
Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I’ve always liked the format of Rowan and
Martin’s “LAUGH-IN.”</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That could be cool.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What about something like “The Jeffersons?” I
grew up in Idaho so that’s how I got my understanding of black people.
Through Sherman Helmsley, LOUISSEE!!!.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “Good Times” was better. Kid Dy-no
mite!!!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You pole are going to far back for me. I
think we have to go after a hipper feel. Like the stuff Eddie Murphy
used to do on “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Or Martin. You go girl.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What about the black exploitation films? No
one has ever tried making that work on TV.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And for reason. Have you ever seen “Scream
Blacula, Scream?”</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I think, and Delacroix will agree with me, the
politics of this show have to be right. We should always be laughing
with our characters, not at them.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The mission was accomplished. All of
these people left the room thinking they would have real input. I was
writing this pilot alone, myself, me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Now came the fun part, finding the
talented performers to cast in the show.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Everybody and their mother was trying to
get in, trying to be seen. Trying to get their piece of the rock.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This was amazing. Who had told these
Negroes that this was what we were looking for? The same old image, it
damn for sure wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Were people this desperate to get
work?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Thanks, Ms. Lulu.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: But I had several more poems.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That’s good. We’ve seen enough. We’ll get
back to you.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: This is the group I was telling you
about.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Which one is your brother?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The big one.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Let’s get started here.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: The Mau-Mau’s are up in dis place. That’s
right, the Mau-Mau’s.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: My righteous name is BIG BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And what are the Mau-Mau’s going to do
for us today?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and
understanding. The Mau- Mau’s, we be scientists. We drop science.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: We’re ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Microphone check. One. Two. One. Two.
One. Two. Hold up. I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers
introduce yourself.</p>
<p><strong>double black</strong>: Yo, I’m Double Black.</p>
<p><strong>black black</strong>: Check it, Black Black.</p>
<p><strong>smooth black</strong>: I’m Smooth Black, the lover in dis’
piece.</p>
<p><strong>hard black</strong>: Hard Black.</p>
<p><strong>mo black</strong>: He’s Jo Black.</p>
<p><strong>jo black</strong>: And he’s Mo Black.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: I’m last but not least, you can call
me 1/16th Black.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Good. We’re really blacked-oops, backed
up, so shall we begin?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Microphone check. One. Two. One. Two. Yo,
the name of this joint is BLAK IZ BLAK. Hit it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Needless to say, the Mau-Mau’s did not
fit into our plans.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: As I told Sloan, there’s a black sheep in
every family.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Finland. This is a travesty. A debacle. A
mockery.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Delacroix. This is the director I was
telling you about. Jukka Laks.</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: So nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Nice to meet you. If you don’t mind me
asking you - how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: I just turned twenty.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I’m gonna leave you two creative geniuses
alone.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Dunwitty, don’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: Helsinki, which is the capital of
Finland.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Finland.</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: You know, Finlandia vodka? Yes?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a
Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro
before?</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: What’s a Negro.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: A fiasco. A disaster. A boondoggle. An
abomination.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Did you just ask me what’s a Negro?</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: Ahhh!!! I never heard of that term before. I
thought you were BLACK of African-American. No?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN
AMERICAN, there were</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: Thank you for correcting my ignorance. I’m
looking forward to working side by side with you. I feel we make a good
team.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How did you get this gig?</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do
you say - hot?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This is a TV show, not a music video.</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: Then will you teach me what I need to know.
Maybe we learn from each other, if that’s possible, no?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This is a travesty. A debacle.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You’ve said that already.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’m gonna slit my wrists. Cut my throat.
For the love of Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: For the love of Joseph and Mary.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I will not be held responsible for these
revisions. These changes are not the way I want to go. This is an
outrage. This is a sham. A violation!</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Calm down, please.</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: In Finland, when we get upset…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I don’t give a good goddamn about
Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: We just punched it up a bit. Made it
funnier.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Funnier to who and at who’s expense?
Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the
demostrations commence, I’m giving them your home address. Let’s see how
you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I seriously doubt that will ever happen.
Didn’t I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some
miracle you’re correct, I’m gonna invite them inside my house and we’ll
have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Just want to say good luck.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Break a leg.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Wait a minute. Hold up.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Can I kiss you too?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Naw. I’ll take the zero.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You feel good, not nervous?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I feel fine.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Not nervous? Relaxed?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Sloan, will you take your boss out of here
so I can get ready.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: How’s the audience?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Fired up.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: How you feelin’?</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Good. I’m not sure about this
material.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The material is fine.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: We’re trying to do something new here,
some groundbreaking stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: It’s the bone breaking stuff I’m
worried about.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Everything’s gonna be alright. You and Mantan
will be huge stars after tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Your life will never be the same.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Let’s leave the man in peace so he can get
ready.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We both lied to him.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What do you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Just don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Good luck, Jukka. Do a good show.</p>
<p><strong>jukka</strong>: Thank you very much. I always try my
best.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I want you to meet my lovely wife Verna.
Honey, this is Pierre Delacroix and Sloan Hopkins.</p>
<p><strong>verna</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The pleasure is mine.</p>
<p><strong>verna</strong>: My husband has been raving about the awesome
work you’ve done. How did you ever think of something like this? It’s
absolutely brilliant. Pure genius.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I guess it was divine inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>verna</strong>: Hope to see you both after the taping.
Congrats in advance.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Divine inspiration?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I was trying to be nice.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I want to apologize about my brother and the
Mau-Mau’s. I should not have imposed them on you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: C’mon. You were only doing what family is
supposed to be doing for family. You gave your brother a shot. That’s
all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot. He got
his.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We should blacken up like they did it back in
the day. Keep the ritual the same.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Pour some alcohol on the corks, then light
it.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Let them burnt to a crisp, and when burnt
out, mash them to a powder.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Add water, mix to a thick paste.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: And voila! You have your blackface.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Please put cocoa butter on your face and
hands…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: To protect your skin.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The final detail…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: …are the lips.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The redder the lipstick the better. I suggest
firetruck red.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Show…</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: This is my best friend Sleep ’N Eat.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: And this is my very best friend
Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: We’re two real COONS!</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: We both left the hustle and bustle of
Uptown, Harlem…</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: …the big apple, New York, New
York.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: To come back to our roots.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Our Alabamy Home. Now we’re getting
countrified. We is Bama’s.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: No mo’ “city slickers.” Ahh, can’t you smell
the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Tell ’em what you mean Mistuh
Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep ’N Eat.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Give or cousins some of dem educated
feets.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Cousins, first, second, third and
distant, let’s have Mantan take us all the way back to a much more
simpler time. A time wen men were men, women were women, and Neggras
knew their place.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Cousins, I want all of you to go to your
windows. Go to your windows and yell. Yell, I’m tired of the drugs, the
crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents. I’m
tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring
less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I’m tired, you’re
tired, we’re all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing,
whore mongling Professional athletes. Aren’t you tired of these
basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking
sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho’s? I know I am and
so is Sleep ’N Eat.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: You tellin’ the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Go to your windows and yell out, scream with
all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and
battered bodies. I’M</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS
brass. They saw some clips from the pilot and they’re rushing it onto
the air. Yo, we’re a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows. We’re on
in 3 weeks. Didya hear what I just said, Yo?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: They didn’t even view a rough cut, just
some scenes we quickly cut together.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This has to be a big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: The big mistake was my not believing in
your genius earlier. From the gitgo, from jump street.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Hold on a sec, I got a call.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this
other call.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I gots to go, it’s my Moms.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I want to meet her one day, please tell
her the great news. I’m OUT like Vanilla Ice.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Peerless, your father called.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’ll be right over.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: So what’s up with you?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: The good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’m an asthmatic. Been one all my life. Can’t
go anywhere without an inhaler.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Are you trying to rap to me?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: He wants you to come and see him.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: He said that?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Yes he did.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: He’s performing at some place outside of
Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I can’t go all the way down south.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Richmond is not all the way down south.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I don’t even know why you’re still
concerned over him. Daddy’s not with you.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Regardless, he still is your father.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It’s gonna be hard for me to get away
with the show taking off.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Even more reason to see him. He’ll be
overjoyed with your success.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: C’mon, Mommy. Daddy hasn’t been impressed
with anything I’ve ever done. From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee
to the present.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Peerless, last time, go see your father.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Are you trying to seduce me?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You think that’s gonna work, huh?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I figured this was a good time to get
away. Just jump in my ride and go. I always did my best thinking when I
was driving alone. I needed to think out clearly what I was going to do
with this MANTAN - THE</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: ’Cuse me. Please. Can you please show me
some respect. I’m up here trying to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Mind yo’ business.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Don’t make me have to come over there and
whoop you upside ya head.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Just messin’ with ya. But please if you and
your lady need to discuss something, take it outside. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Brother man, that’s my father up there
and I drove a long way to see him perform. Please take this fifty, go
buy you and the young lady some drinks in the club.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That’s yo’ Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t need yo money for drinks. Besides, she’s
drunk already. C’mon, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Don’t bring your woman out if you can’t
keep her in deep check. If my woman ever did something crazy like that
I’d put my size 12 dead up in her ass.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I want to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Go away, unless you got my money.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It’s me, Peerless.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Son. Good to seeya. Good to seeya.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Pull up a chair. Oh, excuse me, this is my
lady DOT.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Glad to meet you, too. You are all your father
talks about.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Honey, pour me and my son a drink.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: I’ll leave you two alone.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Good woman. I trained her right.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Daddy, she’s younger than me.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: My game is still strong. No Viagra for me,
don’t need no chemicals. Just my tonic.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Purely for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I thought you had promised Mommy you
stopped.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: I did. I’m not an alcoholic. I just like to
drink.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How did you end up here?</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: How did I end up at the third rate
chittlin’ circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is
that what you’re asking ya Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That’s what I’m askin’.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Because I had too much pride. Too much
integrity. I wouldn’t lick nobody’s butt. Some material I refused to
do.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Daddy, it can’t be just because of that.
There had to be other factors.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: That’s the only reason, period. They only
want one certain kind of black comic.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Another one of your conspiracies to hold
ya career back?</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: All I know is what happened to me. All that
other mess I just file into the “life’s too short” category.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Enough about me, what’s happening with
you?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The same old, same old. Trying to get my
stuff through.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Dem white boys giving you a hard time?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Nuthin’ I can’t handle.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: The truth is never let them seeya sweat.
You do that, that’s half the battle.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Where do you go from here?</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Three nights Charleston, South
Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I didn’t mean that, in life.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: In life? I’ma keep on living, having a good
drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make
people laugh. Haven’t I always tol’ you all nigga’s are entertainers?
The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: I’m not an alcoholic. I just like to
drink.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: We know that baby.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Let’s get him over to the bed.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless,
you’re a good son, I love you. You never gave me no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I love you too, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>junebug</strong>: Always keep ’em laughing.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How long has my father been like
this?</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Not that often. He was excited to see you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: So he drank himself into a stuper?</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: The drinking is for the pain. It doesn’t kill
it, just dulls it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: So what’s up with you?</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was
performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to
come with him. I quit my job and we’ve been together ever since.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Don’t tell him it’s from me or he won’t
take it.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Your father is proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: He never showed it.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is
stubborn just like you.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: I’ll take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: My Daddy. I’m not mad at him. Not at all.
Junebug was the reason I got into this business in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And I thank him for that. However, it did
me no good seeing him in that state. Daddy was a broken man. He had been
a strong man, with conviction, integrity, principles and look where it
had gotten him. I had to ask myself did I want to end up where he
was?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That was the last time I ever saw my
father.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Everybody say Ho!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Ho!</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: That’swhatI’mtalkin’bout!

word. Everybody go it?</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Alright. Here we go. Let’s go</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Let’s go NIGGERS.</p>

<p><strong>massa charlie</strong>: Who goes in there?</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: We’d better hide.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: It’s dat mean, evil overseer Massa
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>massa charlie</strong>: I say who goes in there?</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: There’s nobody in here ’cept us chickens.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Who’s side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t help it. It’s too
funny.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It was the Day of Reckoning. After a
massive advertising and publicity campaign…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: …the public would finally get a chance to
view Mantan. I was feelin’ a little bit like Dr. Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What would their reaction be? I hadn’t
the foggiest.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Everybody shut up.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Calling all my cousins, you’re about to
take a trip down to Hang ’Em High Plantation, home of your two favorite
coons, Mantan and Sleep ’N Eat.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Why they gotta make my nose so big?</p>

Da Bomb for you. It makes you feel like a MAN and it makes dem bitches

The cat was in the bag and the bag was in the river.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Did you watch MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM
MINSTREL SHOW last night?</p>
<p><strong>president clinton</strong>: Yes I did and I can honestly say
I feel it promotes racial healing.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: I know all of you have seen the overnight
ratings. Through the roof. But in this game you gotta be one, two, three
steps ahead. I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She’s the best media
consultant in the biz.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: First, I would like to say I love the show.
It’s very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with
Dr. King.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: Good question, straight to the point. I like
your style. Because of the content of the show we can expect some
spirited reactions.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Myrna is here to help us plan our
strategy.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: The best defense is offense.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I thought it was the other way
around.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: You get my point. I’ve mapped out some
strategies to help bolster our position.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: That this is fun. Nice wholesome fun.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Goldfarb, run it down for them.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: The Mantan Manifesto. Catchy ain’t it? Number
One. We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the
cameras. Two. Let the audience decide. Three. Who put these critics in
charge? These so-called cultural police? Four. Who determines what is
black? Five. Mantan is a satire. Six. If they can’t take a joke, “F”
’em.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: We all stick to this, it’s smooth
sailing.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: It sounds kinda simplistic to me.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: I’ve done my research.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: These are black folks we’re talkin’
about, not some lab mice in a cage.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in
African-American studies from Yale, so I do feel I’m qualified.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Let Myrna finish.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: Thank you. And always smile.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Yeah, show dem pearly whites.</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name of
Dr. Martin Luther King, use the word “community” often when talking
about Mantan. And finally our biggest plus is you, Pierre Delacroix.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Yes you!</p>
<p><strong>myrna</strong>: This show was created, conceived by you, a
non-threatening African- American male. Voila. End of argument. It can’t
be racist because you’re black.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’m not black. I’m a NEGRO!!!</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: So you have your small victory, now what?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: A small victory isn’t that small when
you’ve been use to losing.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: A gift.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: No matter what you think, you did come up
with something unique. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Put a coin in the hand.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Read it on the back.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The Jolly Nigger Bank.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of
the century.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I thought it was appropiate.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Is that good or bad?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: It’s all good. You got a hit show, you’re
gonna need a bank. Plus, I love these old black collectibles.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: To me, it shows part of our history in this
country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.</p>
<p><strong>gary byrd</strong>: Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He
is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let’s get
right into it. You have been called by some in the community a traitor,
a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Because race has always been a sensitive
issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing
with the show, it’s when folks start trying to mess with my inherent
right as an artist, that’s when I get mad. No one, in any way, shape or
form should be censored.</p>
<p><strong>gary byrd</strong>: No matter how sexist or racist the
material may be?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Yes. And I say yes because who is to
judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is
not? Who? Who can play God?</p>
<p><strong>gary byrd</strong>: But the line has to be drawn.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Don’t you people get it? We’re in the
21st Century. Slavery was over four hundred years ago. All that stuff
people talked in the old days, it’s over. Folks always crying, white man
this, white man that. Let’s all grow up.</p>
<p><strong>gary byrd</strong>: Are you trying to excuse our
Holocaust?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Can I finish? Thank you. I had a great
Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had
walked on the Moon.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: When I was a little kid, I would argue
with her, “it’s on TV.” She would answer “I don’t care what’s on that
idiot box. No MAN is on the MOON.” Well, there are a lot of your Negroes
just like my Aunt Sister. Face up to it. The world has changed and if
you don’t adapt, change with it, you will be left behind. This show is a
parody. Are you telling me that nobody can use some humor, have some
laughs in their lives? Is that what you’re telling me?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: When American people want something, they
want it now, they want it big.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: They wanted the hula hoop…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: They wanted their yo-yo’s.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Who could ever forget those lovable pet
rocks.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Beanie Babies…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Now the latest, hottest, newest sensation
across the nation was…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It was the rage.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Big Black, I can’t log on the Mantan
Website now, it’s overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel
Show at www.nigger.com was getting 500,000 hits a day.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Keep trying.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Why is Jess and Reverend Al down there?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: So they can be on TV.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: You sound like the media.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This is nothing. It will blow over by
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Same thing Giuliani said.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to
animals or some sex scandal. Besides, there is no such thing as bad
publicity.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Rest your mind. It’s a little somethin’
something.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Those were the last pair of tap shoes
worn by Bill “Bojangles” Robinson. In fact, he died with them on.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: No joke. Serious.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Hope the same thing doesn’t happen to me.
That’s some big shoes to fill.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: In time.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: That Tom, That Negro…</p>
<p><strong>double black</strong>: …that handkerchief head…</p>
<p><strong>black black</strong>: …dancing monkey…</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: …Benedict Arnold…</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: …that simpleton is holding back the race.
They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep ‘N Eat,
y’knowwhatI’msayin’?</p>
<p><strong>hard black</strong>: Yo, Big Black, Sleep ‘N Eat ain’t even a
nigger, y’knowwhatI’msayin’?</p>
<p><strong>smooth black</strong>: He’s Mexican, y’knowwhatI’msayin’?</p>
<p><strong>mo black</strong>: He’s Dominican, y’knowwhatI’msayin’?</p>
<p><strong>jo black</strong>: He’s Peter Rican, y’knowwhatI’msayin’?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Same thing, y’knowwhatI’msayin’,
y’knowwhatI’msayin’!</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: We know. We know. Yo, check it, my
black brothers, we can’t let this slide. Not this injustice. Nah, no
way. Dem’ two real coons iz ill.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: 1/16, tru’ ’dat. True ’dat.</p>
<p><strong>double black</strong>: Let me gat him.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Nah, too easy, this has to be symbolic,
has to be on the world stage.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: This is a nice place. It must have cost a
pretty penny.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Sloan, I got it like ’dat.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Oh you do, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Just a little something’ somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I hope you save a little somethin’
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Gots no intention of ending up broke.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Y’know, at the beginnin’ of the century,
African-American had to perform in blackface. You ever heard of Bert
Williams? He was a great artist.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: No, before my time.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You don’t read, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Never read a book in my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Maybe you need to start.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Maybe I need to do a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black
up. They had no choice. They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.
Did you know that’s written in the Constitution of the United
States?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Why all of a sudden are you flippin’ on me?
This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don’t even
try to play it like you ain’t a part of all this. You down with
Delacroix.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I just don’t want you and Cheeba to get
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: We can look out for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Let’s have a warm nigger applause for our
two favorite coons, Mantan and Sleep ’N Eat. TWO REAL COONS!</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I fell out of my bed last night.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: You slept too near where you got
in?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I slept too near where I fell out.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: You expect the unexpected in
circumstances of that peculiarity.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Sleep ’N Eat, what’s the matter with you?
Using all dose ten dollar words?</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Mantan, it is possible that my
hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect
contained in that diminutive coconut?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don’t
cross words with me.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Ain’t Jemima on the pancake box?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Dat’s yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I’ve
seen a lot of troubles lately.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: How be dat?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I don’t know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Well, I’ll be an Alabama porch
monkey’s uncle.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Years ago I married a widow who had a
grown-up daughter. My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my
stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my
stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father’s wife. Soon
after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father’s
brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.
My father’s wife also became the mother of a son. He was of course my
brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.
Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother’s
mother.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Sleep ‘N Eat, I was my wife’s husband and
grandchild at one and the same time. And lo’ and behold, as the husband
of a person’s grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own
grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: Mantan, dat sho’ is a whopper.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: You couldn’t hold out any longer, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I feel a song a comin’ on.</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: A song a comin’ I feel.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I fell right dead in love/wid da sweetest
little dove/little LuLu Snow from Tennessee/she made a slave of me/an’
from her I’se never free/I’d do anything she’d ask me to…</p>
<p><strong>sleep ’n eat</strong>: De money I did save/to dat yeller gal
I gave/for to keep till we was wed/she told me dat nobody’d get away dat
cash/I’ll take good care of date, she said.</p>
<p><strong>pikcaninninies</strong>: She’s de cutest gal in all dis world
I know/If you met her you would say it so/Oh, Lulu, Lulu, ev’ry day I
pines for you/no other gal will do/All I’ve got is yours for life, my
little, my little yaller Lou/A week ago dat Lou wid anudder nigger
flew/took ma money too, all I had/She broke ma heart in two/when I heard
dat she had flew/Do you wonder dat I feel so bad?/She told me not to cry
’case she didn’t say good bye/but she’d take care of dat red/and nobody
would get de cash away from her/She’d keep her word to me she said.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: He gots to be did.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Did he gots to be.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: To my astonishment, not only did the
people in TV land love us, but also the critics. _ 102.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Mantan was being hailed as
groundbreaking, barrier breaking, also earth shaking. I looked forward
to my awards. Just vindication for all my hard work, all my talent that
had been previously overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>alec baldwin</strong>: The winner for Best New Sitcom is… The
envelope please…</p>
<p><strong>alec baldwin</strong>: The winner is… Pierre Delacroix for
Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show!</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Alec Baldwin, this is the very first time
we’ve ever met, you don’t know this, I’m your biggest fan and I want you
to have my Emmy. It’s for you, out of the deep bowels of my heart - I
don’t deserve this. You take it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: If I did that I’d be assured to work
forever. Delacroix the grateful Negro.</p>
<p><strong>woody harrelson</strong>: The winner for Best Sit-Com is…</p>
<p><strong>woody harrelson</strong>: …Pierre Delacroix for Mantan. Come
on up and get your Golden Globe.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That routine would go over like
gangbusters. I would be a dancing fool, Hollywood’s new favorite Negro,
move over Danny, Morgan, Samuel L., move over Whoopi.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I had it all planned. To the T.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I’m tired of you pickaninnies messing up my
choreography. It goes like this.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Try it again.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Let’s take a ten minute break.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I’m not drinking the Kool-Aid.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: What are you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: Jim Jones, y’know. I’m not drinking the
Kool-Aid.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Good. I’ve got a broken back from carrying
you all these years anyway.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: So that’s what you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Damn skippy.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: You’re in this up till ya neck.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Don’t shoot me, I’m just the piano
players.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: You can walk away. We both can.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Yeah, that’s easy for you to do. You never
had any talent.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: I’m so tired of you running that. I always
worked hard for you. You think I’m a leech, a kling-on, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I’m the star of Mantan, so you do that.
Quit, walk away. And don’t come crawling back, either.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Why don’t you call him?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: For what? He left. Not me.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You’re sure this is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: My people love me.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’ll be down front. You better start putting
your face on.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Y’know what?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: You look beautiful like that.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Thank you so very much. Show me some
love.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Thank you. My name is Honeycutt and I
want to welcome you to a very special evening. It’s always great coming
back to the World Famous Apollo Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: As everybody knows if you can make it
here on this stage in front of the most discriminating audience in the
world you can make it anywhere. Ladies and gentlemen, let’s show some
real Uptown love for Mantan The Marvelous!</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: This doesn’t change a thing. I will still
love him.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Pull ya self together.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: What are you? A man or a mouse? Are you a
punk? Punking out on me?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You getting scared because some people
don’t like what you are doing?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass
up in dat piece.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You’ve made it from the guttermost to the
uppermost. Don’t you know you should never let them see you sweat.
Y’knowwhatI’msayin’?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And now is definitely not the time to
bitch up.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Our guest tonight is the
extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan. Thanks for coming in.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Tavis, thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Before we begin, I want to thank you
for coming on my show for your first television interview. You could
have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but
you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I’m more comfortable around my people.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Let’s jump right into it. Your show
has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue. How do
you see all of this?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Yo, Tavis, check it out. This is the
two-one, the 21st century and it’s all about the money. Like my man Mase
says, “it’s all about the Benjamins.”</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Money and nothing else?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Money makes the world go round. It ain’t no
joke being poor. I know whatI’mtalkin’‘bout. Y’knowwhatI’msayin’? I’ve
lived on the street. I’ve been homeless. I’ve learned how to play the
game, work the game, be in the game.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Is it inevitable that the game plays
you?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That’s
what a lot of Negroes don’t understand. Protesting isn’t gonna do a damn
thing. If people don’t like our satire in our number one hit show then
don’t watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Don’t you feel that is a simplistic
retort?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I don’t know what a retort is, but it’s
simple. Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL. It’s not
just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem. This is America. Our
ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody
else. I’m not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and
they’re laughing at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: I admit, that’s a very hard thing to
do. Quickly let’s go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from
our proud sponsors, DA</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Our first caller is Big Black from
Brooklyn. Go ’head.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Microphone check, one, two. One, two. Yo
Tavis, I be lovin’ yo show but Mantan you is foul. Why you perpetrating?
You a sellout.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: That’s our opinion.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: You’re a traitor to the race. A tool for
the Caucasoids.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Why? Because I’m successful? Because I don’t
use “Causcasoids” as an excuse for not fulfilling my dreams?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: I ain’t hearing all dat noise. You
getting played and you don’t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do
you do?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: I’m a revolutionary.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: That’s a job?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: That’s a full time job, especially when
sellouts like you are running around, acting insane.</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: And another thing, you better stay away
from my sister or you better…</p>
<p><strong>tavis smiley</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need
to go there. We can all agree to disagree without making threats.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How long have you and Hambone been
hangin’ out?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You’re the one that put us together. We’re
friends.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: That crazy brother of yours doesn’t think
so.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: He’s just playing big brother.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with
Mantan?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Please don’t go there.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Dunwitty and I feel you’ve been getting
too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I can’t lie to him. If he asks me something,
I tell him what I think.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Do you have to be so damn forthright?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into
the light.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Light?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That which has been hidden in darkness is now
in the light. This bucket of blood.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you
want to but your hands are much bloody. I know where I made my big
mistake. I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with
somebody crazier than you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’s why it will be so much fun.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That was a mistake, but I don’t regret
it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The first and only time. A big mistake.
I’m gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Work related or otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Otherwise. I trust you know the
difference. You’re an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: DeLa, kiss my big black ass.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And that’s how you got me in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I want you to please view this. It may save
your Life.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You shouldn’t even be mad at me over
Sloan.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: What you did is dead wrong.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Oh, is it? Buddy boy, in this business if
people don’t produce, they get fired.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Sloan is the hardest working person I’ve
ever met.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Let me ask you a question, if I may. How
do you think she got the job in the first place? I don’t mean to burst
your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Do I have to spell it out for you? In
fact, go ask Sloan yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: How did you get this gig?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Worked my black ass off, first as an intern,
then worked my way up to this position.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: You leave something out?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: After my internship expired, Dela was
impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: And what?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Stop playing me Sloan.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Just ask me what you want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Oh, you gonna make me say it.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Say what, Manray?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Did you ever sleep with DeLa?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We did it one time, only once. It had nothing
to do with the job, it was stupid. Everything I’ve got I’ve earned.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Aw, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’s ancient history. That has nothing to
do with you and I.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: So you say. Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up
just like you used Dela? Work it to the top. I never imagined people in
this biz could flip on you like “IHOP.” I’m damn happy DeLa fired ya
ass.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Forget about me, are you a puppet for
DeLa?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: Don’t try to change to the subject.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Why don’t you answer?</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I know I won’t be your puppet.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You can go now.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: I wuz leaving anyway, for good.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Yo, I got da bomb plan. We gonna hook
homeslice Mantan up nicely.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Hello, Mommy, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: I’m doing okay. Been reading about your
show, it’s all over everywhere. I watched it’s all over everywhere. I
watched it once. I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: You going to attack me too. The show is a
hit. Aren’t you happy for me?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: Of course I’m happy for you. You’ve worked
very hard for your success.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy
called?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Not at all?</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: You know how your Daddy is.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: If and when he calls, please don’t forget
to ask him if he’s seen Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>orchid</strong>: I won’t forget. When are you coming up here
to see your mother?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: When I thought or imagined that my
favorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an inanimate object, a piece of cold, cast
iron, was moving by itself…</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: …I knew I was getting paranoid. Did I
really see what I saw or was I buggin’?</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Is you a nigga?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hell yeah, I’m a nigga.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Ma’am, is you a nigga?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yesiree Bob, you darn tootin’ I’m a
nigger.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Are you a nigger?</p>
<p><strong>tre</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: Are you a nigga?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Honeycutt, I’m a really real niggress.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: You. You. Him. Her. We’re all God’s
niggas. Even the lost souls who don’t know it are niggas cuz niggas is a
beautiful thing.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: They don’t waste any time, do they?</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Delacroix. What?! I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>bunning</strong>: You better talk to him. He won’t listen to
me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Mantan, we got a show to tape.</p>
<p><strong>mantan</strong>: My name is Manray, goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Kook and the Gang, it’s Manray. Let’s do
the taping. You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken
up.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I’m not playin’ myself no mo’.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: How you sound?</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I won’t do it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Manray, I’m very sorry about ya boy
Cheeba and Sloan. Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail
about her, just lookin’ out for a brother. I feel you, all this stuff
happenin’ at once but you can’t let if affect your work. You gotta be
professional.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I’m always gonna be that. But I ain’t doing
no more buck dancing.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: No costume. No blackface.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>bunning</strong>: I should notify Dunwitty.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: And I should put my foot dead up in yo’
ass.</p>
<p><strong>bunning</strong>: I won’t be held responsible.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: We apologize for the holdup but without
further delay, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, let’s give it up
for Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>honeycutt</strong>: C’mon, don’t be niggardly, give it up.
Show Mantan some love.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Stop the tape. Stop the tape. Delacroix.
Get me Delacroix.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Cousins, I want all of you to go to your
windows. Go to your windows and yell, scream with all the life you can
muster up inside your assaulted, bruised amd battered bodies.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I’m sick and tired of being a nigger and I’m
not gonna take it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Drop the curtain. Drop the curtain.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Escort him out the building now!</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: I wasn’t finished doing my dance.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: But you are finished. Done. Nigga’s like
you are a dime a dozen. I’m gonna slide Honeycutt right into ya spot. We
won’t miss a step. Get him outta here.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: DeLa, I’ll deal with you next.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Whaddup?</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Whaddup?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: You truly are a dancing fool.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Yo Black, you looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: Don’t start none, won’t be none.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: You is one dead nigger.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Brothers, he asks what did he do?</p>
<p><strong>double black</strong>: If you don’t know there is nuthin’ we
can do for you.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Nigga, you will be executed.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: For singing and dancing?</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: You will be done in front of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>mo black</strong>: The whole world will be watching.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Via the internet.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The Mau-Mau’s had come up with a
brilliant, sadistic plan to broadcast Mantan’s execution LIVE over the
internet.</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: We have pirated broadcasting
facilities. No way we can be found out. We’re in cyberspace.</p>
<p><strong>jo black</strong>: Nobody will find you till it’s too
late.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The Mau-Mau’s sent anonymous e-mail
proclamations to the websites of CNN, ABC, MSNBC and CBS. It was an
invite to witness the Dance of Death, 9 PM, prime time, tomorrow night
on a site to be designated at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It’s no joke getting grilled by the FBI
for five houts.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: We know you’re involved in this
abduction.</p>
<p><strong>cheeba</strong>: You know more than me. Why would I do
something like that to my best friend? Why?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: You tell us.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Somehow, someway, somebody had tipped the
sharks off. It was a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: The X-Force was brought onto the case.
When something involves the internet, these are the people IBM, XEROX,
the CIA, FBI, even the US Government go to.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It was a race against time. The Dance of
Death.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Hello, my name is Thomas Dunwitty. I’m the
Senior V.P. of the entertainment division here at CNS. I come to you
with a heavy heart.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: This abduction is a cowardly, vile, sinful
and dastardly act and I promise these creeps will be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law. This is an attack on your American way of
life…</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: We here at CNS are offering a $100,000
cash award to any information that leads to the safe return home of our
dear friend, Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>dunwitty</strong>: Help us and in addition you will get a
guest-starring speaking role on the next Mantan - The New Millennium
Minstrel Show, plus an added bonus: a lifetime of Da Bomb 125% Malt
Liquor. Let’s you get ya “freak on”, as well as a full wardrobe of Timmi
Hillnigger Active Git Toe Wear. Mantan, may God bless you…</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Let’s go, time’s wasting.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: They sent the notice out on an anonymous
remailer.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: It’s used to mask the origin of an email,
also the computer from which it’s sent.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: There oughta be a law…</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Not yet, anyway, it’s legal. We will find
the source where it’s being broadcasted and hosted. We’ll get the people
that bushwhacked Mantan.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Before Manray is dead?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I can’t answer that.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: SWAT teams all up and down the East Coast
busted in on known dissidents looking for Manray. All the tips called
in, info gathered through surveillance proved for naught.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: The both of you should go home. We will
keep you abreast.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: This is looking like a needle in a haystack.
It’s hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Thank you for your help.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: The X-Force always gets their man.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: It was ten o’clock and the Dance of Death
was about to commence.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Since a lot of people still didn’t have
computers, the networks sought a court order to carry it live, taking
the feed off the internet. It was granted. A life snuff broadcast right
into your living room.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I had to give it to the Mau-Mau’, they
definitely had a sense of irony. They chose www.nigger.com as the
website to pirate.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: We are LIVE on the cyberspace. Whereas
Mantan is a TOM…</p>
<p><strong>black black</strong>: Whereas Mantan is a disgrace…</p>
<p><strong>smooth black</strong>: Whereas Mantan is a head-scratching,
foot-shuffling Negro…</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Whereas, whereas, where’s the ass?</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Whereas Mantan the dancing fool, you are
condemned to death.</p>
<p><strong>jo black</strong>: The Dance of Death.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Dance nigger.</p>
<p><strong>smooth black</strong>: You got anything to say for
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: If you’re gonna kill me, kill me.</p>
<p><strong>smooth black</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Don’t dance. Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: You ain’t Blak.</p>
<p><strong>double black</strong>: Blak you ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>smooth black</strong>: You a Oreo. Not Blak. Not BLAK.</p>
<p><strong>manray</strong>: There is nothing you can do to me. I’m
wearing the taps of Bill “Bojangles” Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: Let’s seeya dance now, Mr. Bojangles.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: You ain’ BLAK.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Leave me alone. Get away from me. You
spearchucker. You black sambo. You nigger pickaninny. Fat Mammie.</p>
<p><strong>big black</strong>: It’s the man!</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! I’ve been
held hostage. They made me part of them against my own free will. Don’t
shoot!</p>
<p><strong>1/16th black</strong>: I’m WHITE. I’m WHITE! Look at me, I’m
white!</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Get up and put that tape in.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Do what I say.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Don’t make me have to use this.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I didn’t think this was in your studies
at NYU.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Watch this. This is what you contributed to.
Because of you, Manray is dead. Mu brother’s dead. It’s all because of
you.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t know anyone would get
hurt. I’m sorry, please give me that gun before you hurt yourself. Give
me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I told you but you wouldn’t listen. You never
listened to me.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Go, get out of here. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: As I bled to death, as my very precious
life oozed out of me all I could think of was that I never made my
father proud. My mother didn’t count.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Everything I did, no matter how great or
small, was always extraordinary to her. With Daddy it was a different
ball game. He never saw me. Pierre Delacroix.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: Now it was time to buy the farm, for me
to meet my maker. Goodbye cousins, and please tune in next week for the
Best of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.</p>
<p><strong>delacroix</strong>: For the love of Joseph and Mary, what
have I done? My God, what have I done?!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: You’ve been had. You’ve been took. You’ve
been led astray. Run amok. You’ve been bamboozled.</p>
