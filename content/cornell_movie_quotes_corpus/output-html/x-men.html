<p><strong>freckled kid</strong>: Man, what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: No, my eyes… my eyes are killing me.</p>
<p><strong>freckled kid</strong>: You want some Visine, man?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: My… eyes…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: … they’re burning…</p>
<p><strong>freckled kid</strong>: Dude, how much did you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I didn’t smoke anything.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: In every organism on Earth there exists a
mutator gene - the X-factor, as it has come to be known. It is the basic
building block of evolution - the reason we have evolved from homo
habilus…</p>
<p><strong>footage reflects the various stages of human
evolution.</strong>: Accompanying it is a GRAPH with a DIAGONAL LINE
indicating the ascent of the “human being” as we know it. Accompanying
the graph are evolving images of the “evolution of man.”</p>
<p><strong>quick shots</strong>: early huts, early clothing; then early
homes, later homes, air conditioning, cars, modern high- rises, etc.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You’re avoiding the question I posed to you
at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words: Are mutants
dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I am avoiding a question that is decidedly
loaded, Senator. The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>senator rowee</strong>: Well, we do license people to
drive.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: But not to live.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Ms. Grey – you work at a school for mutants
in Westchester, New York. Can you tell the members of this committee
what exactly you are teaching these mutants?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Math. History. Science. English. Athletics
–</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to be teaching them how
to use their powers to –</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Control, Senator… we teach them control.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: This was taken by a state police officer in
Secaucus, New Jersey. A man in a minor altercation literally melted the
car in front of him. I don’t know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but
where I come from, you don’t go melting people’s cars when they cut you
off. You do it the old fashioned way – you give ’em the finger. But what
you presume to tell this committee -</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that
in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on
this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I can assure you, there is no such creature
in my genes.</p>
<p><strong>reporters/various</strong>: Dr. Grey, how do you feel about
the Senator’s Statement / How is the mutant community reacting? Is it
true that mutants are dangerous? / Is there a mutant plot to overthrow
the government?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Weíre not the ones to be afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Itís not gonna be that easy.</p>
<p><strong>pyro</strong>: Hand me the dykes.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Preparations are nearly completed for
the upcoming anniversary gala celebrating the formation of the United
Nations. With nearly every invitation confirmed, the occasion promises
to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: …and the leading voice in the call for
Mutant registration is Senator Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who claims
to support the constitutional rights of the genetically enhanced, but
whose crusade to register mutants is gaining popularity.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Not this one again.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: I lost him.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: It was Xavierís people. They knew.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I want him. That is all they know because
that is all you know.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I think the Presidentís pre-occupation with
international affairs has drawn his attention away from this problem.
Americanís deserve the right to decide whether they want their children
to be in school with mutants. To be taught by mutants. They also have
the right to know the dangers. Thatís the purpose of registration. And
mark my words, if the President isnít strong enough to do what needs to
be done…</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: And you may mark my words, Senator Kelly.
All your plotting, all your hatred. I have plans for you. Iíve seen you
come, and I will see you go.</p>
<p><strong>tattooed in his arm.</strong>: He then drops the dog tag on
the desk, Magneto stands and heads for the door, Sabretooth follows. The
television shuts off and Magneto waves a hand as though beckoning
someone to follow. Or some thing.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Is that what youíre looking for?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: A piece. Only a piece.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Is it enough?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Enough for a test.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I canít believe the President canít see it. I
wouldnít be surprised if he has a mutant on his staff.</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Have you thought of a demonstration of some
kind? Maybe use the UN Summit to our advantage. The whole world will be
watching.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Iím not interested in the whole world, Henry…
Iím interested in America. Let the rest of the world deal with mutants
their own way.</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Dulles Airport.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … until the Emperor Constantine converted to
Christianity. With that one act, history was changed. The Christians who
were once prosecuted and fed to the lions, became accepted.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: So as their leaders went, so did follow the
hearts and minds of the people of the Roman empire. Which made for some
very happy Christians.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Good morning, Logan.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Would you like some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Youíre not the only one with gifts.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I brought you here so that you would be safe
from Magneto.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: A very powerful mutant who for some reason
has taken an interest in you. Iím not sure why, but until we find out, I
must ask you to stay.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Where the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Pilot?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Dear God… Dear… God.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You… wha… Who are you… Where is Henry?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time
Senator.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You mutant bastards…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Whatever you do to me… no matter what youíll
make me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Gosh, I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: People like you are the reason people like me
exist.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: And people like you are the reason I was
afraid to go to school as a child.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Are you a ìGod-fearing man,î Senator?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: The intention of registration act -</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: INTENTION? Intention, Senator? We are
talking about mankind here. His fear. It is only a matter of time before
mutants will be herded into camps. Studied for weaknesses. And
eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What is it you intend to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Letís just say, God works too slowly.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Weíve found him.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Oh… Oh God… what have you done to me?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Welcome to the future… brother.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>brad 2</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Awww… look guys sheís shy.</p>
<p><strong>brad 3</strong>: Maybe thatís why sheís alone. Is that why
youíre alone?</p>
<p><strong>brad 4</strong>: Iíll keep you company.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Logan, his ears picking up everything.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Hey, what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Donít touch me.</p>
<p><strong>brad 3</strong>: Hey Brad, sheís a mutant!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How about you sit down and leave the kid
alone, alright?</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Sheís a mutant.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah, well, nobodyís perfect.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Rogue, she gets up and huddles toward the
rear of the train.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: I think you should take a seat little
fella.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Listen – I donít want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Well you got trouble.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Loganís eyes, his pupils are getting
smaller. His brow furrows like a wolf. A low guttural GROWL.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Brad 3 running out of the car with the
other passengers. A TRANSIT COP pushes past the fleeing passengers, into
the car.</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Freeze… transit police. Drop your
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: You can come out now, Logan. Youíre among
friends.</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: You Homo Sapiens and your guns.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Thatís enough, Max!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Storm, a GUST OF WIND.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Iíll never understand your regard for them,
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: And Iíll never understand terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You
should do the same.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Not at the cost of lives, Max.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Magneto.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Itís alright… itís alright.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: The two in Alaska. Just how do you people
manage to be in the right place at the right time? Still tinkering with
Cerebro?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What do you want with him?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Canít read my mind?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Still trying to make the world safe for our
kind. Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves –
definitively.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: You definition of definitive was always a
bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Letís just say that I am out to make some
radical changes. Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake…
Leave him to me.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>pyro</strong>: IíM BLIND.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: If I could make you understand. If you
could just be made to see it the way I do. The way itís going to be.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The way what is going to be?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Iím going to change the world with or
without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row
seat.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What do you mean to do?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: This checkmate goes to you. I didnít want
to hurt anyone. But you leave me no choice.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Look, I appreciate your concern. But, I do
better on my own.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: You got less than sixty miles today. Iíll
make you a deal. Two days. If we havenít figured out what Magneto wants
with you by then… Iíll bring you back myself.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What are you going to do with her?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Rogue is a beautiful girl, with an
extraordinary power. One that even her own family isnít able to accept.
Sheís been on her own for weeks now, searching for a home. A place to
belong.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Forty-eight hours, old man. But if you cross
me, I wonít feel any guilt about what I do to you.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Is there such a thing as too much
security? A possible complication adding to the United Nations
Anniversary is the sheer number of security personnel for what will be
the largest single summit in the history of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What have you bastards done to me?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: How are we feeling today, Senator?
Advanced, I hope…</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Iíll find him.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Anything else I can get you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Some cigars. Case of beer.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Thereís no smoking or drinking on the school
grounds.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I wonít light the cigars - how about
that?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Iíll see what I can do – You should get some
sleep. Even with your healing ability, youíre going to be hurting for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What if I like the pain?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The Professor said you were a solider.
Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah? Well I donít like to talk about my
past.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Maybe, the Professor could help you with
that.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: By reading my thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: If necessary.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What if theyíre naughty?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Get some shut-eye, slick.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Scott.. I -</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I donít like him being here.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: You saw what happened tonight. You think
Magneto wonít come after him again. You think he wonít come here if
necessary. This is a school, for Godís sake.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some
terrible purpose itís our responsibility to do something.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You know I love you, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Adamantium. Until today I thought it to be a
myth. Impenetrable, unbendable, resistant to the most extreme heat,
cold, indestructible.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Itís been grafted to his entire skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: He also has accelerated healing abilities -
uncharted regenerative capability, making his age impossible to
determine. He could very well be older than I am.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Is the Adamantium part of his mutation?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: No. Someone put it there, relying on his
healing abilities to keep him alive.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: What do you think Magneto wants with
him?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Iím not entirely sure itís ìhimî that
Magneto wants.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: X-ray of Loganís Adamantium skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>the sound of molten metal hitting liquid is
unnerving.</strong>: Mixed with screams, it is unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: DONíT TOUCH HER.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Why is everybody up at sunrise?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: The sun is setting, Logan. Youíve been asleep
for nineteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What did she do to me?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: She borrowed your power to save her life.
When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths – their gifts. In
your case – your ability to heal. Thatís why she keeps her body
covered.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I felt like she almost killed me.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: If she held on any longer she could have.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: And you think it helps calling her Rogue?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Weíve learned to embrace what we are rather
than hide it like an affliction. For some, it has become their identity.
You mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of
pride.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Inspiring – Now what am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I wanted to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Letís take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: How long have you been in Alaska?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I donít remember. Is that what you wanted to
ask me?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I just wanted to make you clear on
something. Personally, I donít care what Magneto wants with you. He can
take those claws of yours and use them for Barbecue skewers. What I do
care about is the safety of this group. The Professor is in charge, and
after the Professor, thereís me. So, for the remainder of your time
here, youíre going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so
no one else gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Iíve served with men like you before.
Methodical. Systematic – Naive. You know what happens to those men in a
real fight?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: You know, you –</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier, or
your… X-Men.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Cyclops!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I have a question for you, Chuck. Whatís the
point?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The point of what?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This. This whole God damn thing. Making
yourselves into some sort of ìteamî of super-powered freaks. Teaching
wayward mutants about classical literature. For what?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The point is to step into a more evolved
position of social responsibility. To recognize that there is a world
out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human
beings.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What if it never happens? What if theyíre so
afraid of us that we become the enemy? – This place is gonna be one
giant cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Now thatís Magneto talking.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No. Thatís me talking. And you know what?
Itís only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy
wants with me.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I believe he wants you for your
Adamantium.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Professor.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Rogueís missing.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: To find Rogue.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The brainwaves of mutants are quite
different than those of the average human being.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You designed this yourself?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Actually, Magneto helped me put it
together.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He helped you?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: We were friends once… But that was a long
time ago.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: I donít belong… I donít belong… Iím sorry… so
sorry… thereís nowhere…</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Iíve found her, Westchester Mall.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Iíll go.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: No… Iíll go.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: O.K. sport… you go.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Rogue.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Iím sorry. Iím not like the rest of you – Iím
tired of hurting people.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Itís okay.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Why did I have to be like this? What purpose
does it serve?</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Scream for me.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Dear God.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: SOMEONE HELP ME. SHEíS NOT BREATHING.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: HELP ME. STORM ISNíT BREATHING.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: YOU HAVE TO COME AND GET ME. I CANíT</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Here, here, here… a little left. Careful.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: But why would they do this?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You should always work with a spotter.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Heís busy right now.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I was thinking maybe you and me could go into
town.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Were you now?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Let go.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The screen – ACCESS GRANTED – CHARLES
XAVIER</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The black boots of a man, walk down a
hallway, as students peer from their sleeping quarters, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Heís uptight.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: He takes his work seriously.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He takes himself seriously.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What is it youíre failing to get at? Are you
interested in me?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Iím just interested.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Logan, do you see this ring?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Iíve seen a lot of rings.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Yeah, Iíll bet you have.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Rogue, where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Logan. The Professor wants you to come with
me right away.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hey Rogue, tell Jean what you were telling me
last night.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: The Professor–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You remember. About women.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Logan–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Whatever you say about them being the
same…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Logan, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This ainít Rogue!</p>
<p><strong>angle tight</strong>: Loganís left hand is wrapped around
Rogueís throat but part of it is TOUCHING THE EXPOSED SKIN OF HER</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Telekinesis.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Jean!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I do love a good check mate.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Come with me and Iíll let her live.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You think I care about her? Iím the only one
whoís sure to walk out of here.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Then why donít you kill her.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Itís going to be alright.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: When Rogue left the mansion, they must have
followed her.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Yes… they wanted me out of the way. If I had
been here… I…</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Cyclops and Jean as they burst into the
room.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Whatís wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: His vital signs are weak and getting
weaker.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Iím in the process of running more tests. But
it seems that every minute that goes by he gets weaker.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Can you help him?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: I donít know.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The little girl – light from the hole
washes over her face. Then suddenly the light is cut off, as if
something is blocking the hole.</p>
<p><strong>dolly in</strong>: as the small girl steps back, a look of
fascination comes across her face. As if she sees something coming
through the hole.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Itís gone. The neuro-filter, someone removed
it.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector,
regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the
Professorís mind. Itís what keeps him from being crushed by the
consciousness of millions.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Can the Professor repair his own mind?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Iím afraid without Cerebroís help, he wonít
have the strength to heal himself – And without the neuro- filter…
thereís no Cerebro.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Heís already losing control of his vitals.
Respiratory. Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by
tomorrow morning, Iím afraid.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: We have to find Magneto.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: No. Iím… I donít know if we can do this
without Charles.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: He put you in charge for a reason, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>small girl</strong>: Dr. Grey?…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Dr. Grey.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Senator?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Your front door was damaged… there was a
hole…</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Iím Beast.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Of course you are.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Iím sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was
afraid if I went to a hospital, they would…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you
think. Not all of us.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Tell it to the ones that did this to me.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I donít see these spikes youíre talking about.
Iím going to give you an antibiotic for the - Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Hello, Rogue?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Hold on, Iíll get the others.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Senator… Kelly?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Yes… Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I am Charles Xavier. This is my school.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I was kidnapped… They killed GUYRICH…
mutants… There was a light… a bright… light.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Whatever you do to me… no matter what –
youíll make me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: And people like you are the reason I was
afraid to go to school as a child.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The mutant gene tells the body when it needs
to change.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I can assure you, there is no such creature
in my genes.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: In every organism on Earth there exits a
mutator gene – The X-factor. The beginnings of another stage of
evolution.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: God works too slowly.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What have you bastards done to me?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Youíre a leader Senator Kelly, you set an
example…</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: … A Demonstration of some kind?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Because if more of you… were like more of
us… like more of us…</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: … the UN summit… the whole world will be
watching.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What is it you intend to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Oh… Oh God… what have you done to me?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Dear God…. dear… God.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … the largest single summit in the
history of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: … the mutator gene will activate.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Welcome to the future… brother… The
brotherhood of mutants.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: It appears as though Magneto has built a
machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings.
And he is using Adamantium as its core.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Its core?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Thomas Edison knew how to make the light
bulb. He had the energy source. He had the vacuum. But he didnít have
the filament. He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to
power.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: … until he found tungsten.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Correct… Apparently, Adamantium is the only
metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces. He used
the Adamantium in Loganís dog tag to test it on the Senator. And I
assume now he plans to use the rest of Loganís skeleton for a larger
demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Yes – Only thereís a problem. The mutator
gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother
nature. Itís forcing the bodyís cells to replicate thousands of times
faster than theyíre accustomed to. The Senatorís body is literally
burning itself out. Scott – this machine kills people and I donít think
Magneto realizes it.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: So where do you think heís planning this
larger demonstration?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: There…</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: THE TV – the gathering leaders of the
world, the water clogged with boats, and the thousands of onlookers on
Manhattan Island. All well within range.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: I wish I could go.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: We all do.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Storm. Try to look for the highest vantage
point. From what I can figure, heíll need to gain as much altitude as
possible to blanket the island. It is my feeling that Magneto has
to–</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Beast.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: You can still hear me… canít you.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Hey. Iím sorry. About Logan. I was
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Well, I think thatís perfectly
understandable.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Iíll tell you one thing though.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Whatís that?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: He calls me sport one more time, and Iíll
blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.</p>
<p><strong>then</strong>: There is a grinding noise and the surface
begins to separate at the half court line. The basketball falls through
the widening hole and bounces off the wing of the rising X-Jet.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: With the ceremonies beginning shortly,
it looks as though the last of the dignitaries have landed at Newark and
Teterboro airports and will be arriving momentarily. It would seem the
United Nations has had their wish tonight. There doesnít seem to be an
empty seat in the house.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Radar Stealth Mode checks out. All right,
thereíll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge. Iím
taking her down.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Into the Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: V.T.O.L. off.</p>
<p><strong>aerial view</strong>: The water ripples as the submersed
aircraft passes under the bridge and into the harbor.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Youíre backstage at the encore of
creation.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: In the road to survival, there is always
sacrifice Logan. We are the future… not them. We must protect ourselves.
After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home – They will
return as brothers, as mutants… and our cause will be theirs. This is
survival, I know you understand that, Logan… or is it Wolverine?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Give me your tired, your poor…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The lights on the Statue of Liberty are
off.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Beast said that he would have to take a high
vantage point.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Letís dock over there.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Liberty One, Liberty One, this
is Horizon, do you copy.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Liberty, whatís the situation
with the lights, over?</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Roger Liberty one. Horizon
out.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: Darling… Weíre clear.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: We should check out operations, see if the
Secret Service is still around.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Iím going to assume that means that the
Secret Service is out of commission. Jean, can you raise me up
there?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Itís too far.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Storm, Rogue, – you take the south
entrance. Jean and I will go in here.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Be careful everyone… I think we may have
company.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Rogue… run.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The map of the statue. Cyclops watches as
the dim red glow turns brighter and brighter. He turns to look up at the
old torch – it glows FIERY RED HOT.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The elevator continuing its crushing
descent.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Lights on.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Roger. We see the lights.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Donít you people die?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Jean. Jean stop. Stop moving.</p>
<p><strong>fires a thin, focused optic beam into the encrusted</strong>:
SLIME, splitting it in half. He pulls the remains away from her
face.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I didnít mean to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Thank God. Logan… we have to help Storm we
have to.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Iíll go back, but first let me find you a
safe place.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Over Loganís shoulder. On the back of his
neck we see some BLUE SCALES. Logan is not Logan, Logan is</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Mystique… Mystique, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Jean… can you?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Iím sorry. Iím not strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: If the temperature changes a single degree…
I only need one hostage.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: … and I know you can – It is a five minute
run from the furthest distance on this island. If you are not back in
this time… I will kill these friends of Xavierís. Including the young
lady from the gymnasium. I think they came here to ìrescue you.î</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Xavier is dying you know. Five minutes
Logan.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Here – Xavierís life.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Magneto. Iíve seen the results of your
machine. Iíve seen Senator Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Ahhhh, so the good Senator survived his
fall? And the swim to shore? He is stronger than I ever could have
imagined.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The experiment was a failure. Kelly didnít
make it. Yes, you were successful in activating his mutator gene, but
you failed to take into account the rest of his body – it wasnít ready
for the strain. Kelly was dead within hours. Your machine kills.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Quiet…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You donít understand.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Why canít you see what I am trying to do?
Why do you stand in my way?</p>
<p><strong>suddenly</strong>: SHOOK – Loganís claws shoot up through the
floor, and through Magnetoís feet. Magneto howls. The claws retract and
Magneto falls.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Storm. She sees something. Several of the
steel bands that support the top of the Statueís head begin to move.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Logan!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Ahh, there you are.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You have to stop him, the machine… it kills
people…</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: Donít listen to her… itís a trap.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: This is.</p>
<p><strong>logan yells – the white light begins to emanate from
his</strong>: BODY. His flesh starts to SMOLDER.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Liberty one this is Horizon… I
repeat… do you copy? Liberty one this is Horizon … I repeat… do you
copy?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Their decks covered with armed Secret
Service.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Your girlfriend is next.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: LOGAN - Hanging from the ear of the
Statue, the claws of his right hand embedded in the lobe at the end of
three sets of long claw-marks.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: I donít think so.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Jean!</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Sorry about this sweetheart, but I made
Logan a promise.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hey, ya big pussy.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Not just me.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Hey… There you are. Is it really you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah, itís really me.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Come on, letís get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Iím o.k. Iím o.k.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Sure you are, sport.</p>
<p><strong>agent/mystique</strong>: Hey, could somebody untie me!</p>
<p><strong>secret service man #3</strong>: Hey! Over here.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Even after last weeks terrorist
vandalization of the Statue of Liberty by an unidentified mutant
organization, the outcome of the vote was 51 to 49 in opposition to the
Mutant Registration Act.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Quiet. Quiet everybody.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: This narrow defeat was probably due in
large part to the surprising last- minute reversal by Senator Scott
ìFrankî Kelly, who until today provided the loudest voice in the cry for
Mutant Registration. Earlier today, Kelly had this to say:</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: If we can not go into the future together,
the divisions of fear and prejudice will tear this country apart.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: No more questions. Please, no more
questions.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: the card as Logan reads it.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Donít you knock?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Theyíre all asking how youíre doing. Are you
feeling up to saying hello to everyone?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Actually Iím feeling up to leaving.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Why? You have a home here now, if you want
it. Everyone will…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What?… miss me? Charley, Iím gonna walk out
the front door and trust me, it wonít be soon enough for everyone
here.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Of course. Everything in this room is for
you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Thanks, Iíll pay you back.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Well if youíre going to leave then you at
least owe them a goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Whatís a guy gotta do to get a beer around
here?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I wouldnít really have let you die, you
know. I just needed…</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Doesnít it ever wake you in the middle of
the night? The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass
that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and
your children? Take you all away?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: It does indeed, Max.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: And what do you do when you wake up to
that?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I feel a great swell of pity for the poor
soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: But you know that it is a war, old friend.
And to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs, by any
means necessary. And for that reason, I will always have the advantage.
No matter how you trap me, how I am contained -</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: And I will always be there, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: And mate.</p>
<p><strong>freckled kid</strong>: Man, what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: No, my eyes… my eyes are killing me.</p>
<p><strong>freckled kid</strong>: You want some Visine, man?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: My… eyes…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: … they’re burning…</p>
<p><strong>freckled kid</strong>: Dude, how much did you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I didn’t smoke anything.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: In every organism on Earth there exists a
mutator gene - the X-factor, as it has come to be known. It is the basic
building block of evolution - the reason we have evolved from homo
habilus…</p>
<p><strong>footage reflects the various stages of human
evolution.</strong>: Accompanying it is a GRAPH with a DIAGONAL LINE
indicating the ascent of the “human being” as we know it. Accompanying
the graph are evolving images of the “evolution of man.”</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You’re avoiding the question I posed to you
at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words: Are mutants
dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I am avoiding a question that is decidedly
loaded, Senator. The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>senator rowee</strong>: Well, we do license people to
drive.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: But not to live.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Ms. Grey – you work at a school for mutants
in Westchester, New York. Can you tell the members of this committee
what exactly you are teaching these mutants?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Math. History. Science. English. Athletics
–</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to be teaching them how
to use their powers to –</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Control, Senator… we teach them control.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: This was taken by a state police officer in
Secaucus, New Jersey. A man in a minor altercation literally melted the
car in front of him. I don’t know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but
where I come from, you don’t go melting people’s cars when they cut you
off. You do it the old fashioned way – you give ’em the finger. But what
you presume to tell this committee -</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that
in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on
this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I can assure you, there is no such creature
in my genes.</p>
<p><strong>reporters/various</strong>: Dr. Grey, how do you feel about
the Senator’s Statement / How is the mutant community reacting? Is it
true that mutants are dangerous? / Is there a mutant plot to overthrow
the government?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: We’re not the ones to be afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: It’s not gonna be that easy.</p>
<p><strong>pyro</strong>: Hand me the dykes.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Preparations are nearly completed for
the upcoming anniversary gala celebrating the formation of the United
Nations. With nearly every invitation confirmed, the occasion promises
to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: …and the leading voice in the call for
Mutant registration is Senator Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who claims
to support the constitutional rights of the genetically enhanced, but
whose crusade to register mutants is gaining popularity.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Not this one again.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: I lost him.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: It was Xavier’s people. They knew.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I want him. That is all they know because
that is all you know.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I think the President’s pre-occupation with
international affairs has drawn his attention away from this problem.
American’s deserve the right to decide whether they want their children
to be in school with mutants. To be taught by mutants. They also have
the right to know the dangers. That’s the purpose of registration. And
mark my words, if the President isn’t strong enough to do what needs to
be done…</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: And you may mark my words, Senator Kelly.
All your plotting, all your hatred. I have plans for you. I’ve seen you
come, and I will see you go.</p>
<p><strong>tattooed in his arm.</strong>: He then drops the dog tag on
the desk, Magneto stands and heads for the door, Sabretooth follows. The
television shuts off and Magneto waves a hand as though beckoning
someone to follow. Or some thing.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Is that what you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: A piece. Only a piece.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Is it enough?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Enough for a test.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I can’t believe the President can’t see it. I
wouldn’t be surprised if he has a mutant on his staff.</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Have you thought of a demonstration of some
kind? Maybe use the UN Summit to our advantage. The whole world will be
watching.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I’m not interested in the whole world, Henry…
I’m interested in America. Let the rest of the world deal with mutants
their own way.</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Dulles Airport.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … until the Emperor Constantine converted to
Christianity. With that one act, history was changed. The Christians who
were once prosecuted and fed to the lions, became accepted.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: So as their leaders went, so did follow the
hearts and minds of the people of the Roman empire. Which made for some
very happy Christians.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Good morning, Logan.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Would you like some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: You’re not the only one with gifts.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I brought you here so that you would be safe
from Magneto.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: A very powerful mutant who for some reason
has taken an interest in you. I’m not sure why, but until we find out, I
must ask you to stay.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Where the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: Pilot?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Dear God… Dear… God.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You… wha… Who are you… Where is Henry?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time
Senator.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You mutant bastards…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Whatever you do to me… no matter what you’ll
make me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Gosh, I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: People like you are the reason people like me
exist.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: And people like you are the reason I was
afraid to go to school as a child.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Are you a “God-fearing man,” Senator?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: The intention of registration act -</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: INTENTION? Intention, Senator? We are
talking about mankind here. His fear. It is only a matter of time before
mutants will be herded into camps. Studied for weaknesses. And
eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What is it you intend to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Let’s just say, God works too slowly.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: We’ve found him.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Oh… Oh God… what have you done to me?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Welcome to the future… brother.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>brad 2</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Awww… look guys she’s shy.</p>
<p><strong>brad 3</strong>: Maybe that’s why she’s alone. Is that why
you’re alone?</p>
<p><strong>brad 4</strong>: I’ll keep you company.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Hey, what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>brad 3</strong>: Hey Brad, she’s a mutant!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How about you sit down and leave the kid
alone, alright?</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: She’s a mutant.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah, well, nobody’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: I think you should take a seat little
fella.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Listen – I don’t want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>brad 1</strong>: Well you got trouble.</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Freeze… transit police. Drop your
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: You can come out now, Logan. You’re among
friends.</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: You Homo Sapiens and your guns.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: That’s enough, Max!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I’ll never understand your regard for them,
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: And I’ll never understand terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You
should do the same.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Not at the cost of lives, Max.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Magneto.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: It’s alright… it’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: The two in Alaska. Just how do you people
manage to be in the right place at the right time? Still tinkering with
Cerebro?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What do you want with him?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Can’t read my mind?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Still trying to make the world safe for our
kind. Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves –
definitively.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: You definition of definitive was always a
bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Let’s just say that I am out to make some
radical changes. Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake…
Leave him to me.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>pyro</strong>: I’M BLIND.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>concentrating, has all of magneto’s minions under
his</strong>: PSYCHIC CONTROL.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: If I could make you understand. If you
could just be made to see it the way I do. The way it’s going to be.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The way what is going to be?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I’m going to change the world with or
without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row
seat.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What do you mean to do?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: This checkmate goes to you. I didn’t want
to hurt anyone. But you leave me no choice.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Look, I appreciate your concern. But, I do
better on my own.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: You got less than sixty miles today. I’ll
make you a deal. Two days. If we haven’t figured out what Magneto wants
with you by then… I’ll bring you back myself.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What are you going to do with her?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Rogue is a beautiful girl, with an
extraordinary power. One that even her own family isn’t able to accept.
She’s been on her own for weeks now, searching for a home. A place to
belong.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Forty-eight hours, old man. But if you cross
me, I won’t feel any guilt about what I do to you.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Is there such a thing as too much
security? A possible complication adding to the United Nations
Anniversary is the sheer number of security personnel for what will be
the largest single summit in the history of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: While the Secret Service has never had
difficulty handling one or even several world leaders, it has never had
to handle the daunting task of watching over all of them.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What have you bastards done to me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: HEY.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: How are we feeling today, Senator?
Advanced, I hope…</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: I’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: ALIVE.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Anything else I can get you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Some cigars. Case of beer.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: There’s no smoking or drinking on the school
grounds.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I won’t light the cigars - how about
that?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I’ll see what I can do – You should get some
sleep. Even with your healing ability, you’re going to be hurting for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What if I like the pain?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The Professor said you were a solider.
Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah? Well I don’t like to talk about my
past.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Maybe, the Professor could help you with
that.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: By reading my thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: If necessary.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What if they’re naughty?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Get some shut-eye, slick.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Scott.. I -</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I don’t like him being here.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: You saw what happened tonight. You think
Magneto won’t come after him again. You think he won’t come here if
necessary. This is a school, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some
terrible purpose it’s our responsibility to do something.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You know I love you, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Adamantium. Until today I thought it to be a
myth. Impenetrable, unbendable, resistant to the most extreme heat,
cold, indestructible.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: It’s been grafted to his entire skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: He also has accelerated healing abilities -
uncharted regenerative capability, making his age impossible to
determine. He could very well be older than I am.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Is the Adamantium part of his mutation?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: No. Someone put it there, relying on his
healing abilities to keep him alive.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: What do you think Magneto wants with
him?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I’m not entirely sure it’s “him” that
Magneto wants.</p>
<p><strong>he sinks into the strange liquid - like water but
thick</strong>: AND VISCOUS.</p>
<p><strong>the sound of molten metal hitting liquid is
unnerving.</strong>: Mixed with screams, it is unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: DON’T TOUCH HER.</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Mom, is that a mutant?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Why is everybody up at sunrise?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: The sun is setting, Logan. You’ve been asleep
for nineteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What did she do to me?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: She borrowed your power to save her life.
When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths – their gifts. In
your case – your ability to heal. That’s why she keeps her body
covered.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I felt like she almost killed me.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: If she held on any longer she could have.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: And you think it helps calling her Rogue?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: We’ve learned to embrace what we are rather
than hide it like an affliction. For some, it has become their identity.
You mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of
pride.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Inspiring – Now what am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I wanted to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Let’s take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: How long have you been in Alaska?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I don’t remember. Is that what you wanted to
ask me?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I just wanted to make you clear on
something. Personally, I don’t care what Magneto wants with you. He can
take those claws of yours and use them for Barbecue skewers. What I do
care about is the safety of this group. The Professor is in charge, and
after the Professor, there’s me. So, for the remainder of your time
here, you’re going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so
no one else gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’ve served with men like you before.
Methodical. Systematic – Naive. You know what happens to those men in a
real fight?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: You know, you –</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier, or
your… X-Men.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Cyclops!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I have a question for you, Chuck. What’s the
point?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The point of what?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This. This whole God damn thing. Making
yourselves into some sort of “team” of super-powered freaks. Teaching
wayward mutants about classical literature. For what?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The point is to step into a more evolved
position of social responsibility. To recognize that there is a world
out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human
beings.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What if it never happens? What if they’re so
afraid of us that we become the enemy? – This place is gonna be one
giant cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Now that’s Magneto talking.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No. That’s me talking. And you know what?
It’s only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy
wants with me.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I believe he wants you for your
Adamantium.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Professor.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Rogue’s missing.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: To find Rogue.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: The brainwaves of mutants are quite
different than those of the average human being.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You designed this yourself?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Actually, Magneto helped me put it
together.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He helped you?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: We were friends once… But that was a long
time ago.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: I don’t belong… I don’t belong… I’m sorry… so
sorry… there’s nowhere…</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I’ve found her, Westchester Mall.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: No… I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: O.K. sport… you go.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Rogue.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m not like the rest of you – I’m
tired of hurting people.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Why did I have to be like this? What purpose
does it serve?</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Scream for me.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Dear God.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: GET OUT OF THE WAY. GET OUT OF THE WAY.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: SOMEONE HELP ME. SHE’S NOT BREATHING.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: ROGUE?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: HELP ME. STORM ISN’T BREATHING.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: YOU HAVE TO COME AND GET ME. I CAN’T
SEE.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Here, here, here… a little left. Careful.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: But why would they do this?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You should always work with a spotter.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: He’s busy right now.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I was thinking maybe you and me could go into
town.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Were you now?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Let go.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He’s uptight.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: He takes his work seriously.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He takes himself seriously.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What is it you’re failing to get at? Are you
interested in me?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I’m just interested.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Logan, do you see this ring?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’ve seen a lot of rings.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Yeah, I’ll bet you have.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Rogue, where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Logan. The Professor wants you to come with
me right away.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hey Rogue, tell Jean what you were telling me
last night.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: The Professor–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You remember. About women.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Logan–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Whatever you say about them being the
same…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Logan, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This ain’t Rogue!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Telekinesis.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Jean!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I do love a good check mate.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Come with me and I’ll let her live.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You think I care about her? I’m the only one
who’s sure to walk out of here.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Then why don’t you kill her.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: It’s going to be alright.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: When Rogue left the mansion, they must have
followed her.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Yes… they wanted me out of the way. If I had
been here… I…</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: His vital signs are weak and getting
weaker.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: I’m in the process of running more tests. But
it seems that every minute that goes by he gets weaker.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Can you help him?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: It’s gone. The neuro-filter, someone removed
it.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector,
regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the
Professor’s mind. It’s what keeps him from being crushed by the
consciousness of millions.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Can the Professor repair his own mind?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: I’m afraid without Cerebro’s help, he won’t
have the strength to heal himself – And without the neuro- filter…
there’s no Cerebro.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: He’s already losing control of his vitals.
Respiratory. Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by
tomorrow morning, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: We have to find Magneto.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: No. I’m… I don’t know if we can do this
without Charles.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: He put you in charge for a reason, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>small girl</strong>: Dr. Grey?…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Dr. Grey.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Senator?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Your front door was damaged… there was a
hole…</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: I’m Beast.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Of course you are.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I’m sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was
afraid if I went to a hospital, they would…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you
think. Not all of us.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Tell it to the ones that did this to me.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I don’t see these spikes you’re talking about.
I’m going to give you an antibiotic for the - Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Hello, Rogue?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Hold on, I’ll get the others.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Senator… Kelly?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Yes… Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I am Charles Xavier. This is my school.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I was kidnapped… They killed GUYRICH…
mutants… There was a light… a bright… light.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Whatever you do to me… no matter what –
you’ll make me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: And people like you are the reason I was
afraid to go to school as a child.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The mutant gene tells the body when it needs
to change.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I can assure you, there is no such creature
in my genes.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: In every organism on Earth there exits a
mutator gene – The X-factor. The beginnings of another stage of
evolution.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: God works too slowly.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What have you bastards done to me?</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Mom, is that a mutant?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: You’re a leader Senator Kelly, you set an
example…</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: … A Demonstration of some kind?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Because if more of you… were like more of
us… like more of us…</p>
<p><strong>guyrich</strong>: … the UN summit… the whole world will be
watching.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What is it you intend to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Oh… Oh God… what have you done to me?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Dear God…. dear… God.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … the largest single summit in the
history of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: … the mutator gene will activate.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Welcome to the future… brother… The
brotherhood of mutants.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: It appears as though Magneto has built a
machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings.
And he is using Adamantium as its core.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Its core?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Thomas Edison knew how to make the light
bulb. He had the energy source. He had the vacuum. But he didn’t have
the filament. He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to
power.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: … until he found tungsten.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Correct… Apparently, Adamantium is the only
metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces. He used
the Adamantium in Logan’s dog tag to test it on the Senator. And I
assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan’s skeleton for a larger
demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Yes – Only there’s a problem. The mutator
gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother
nature. It’s forcing the body’s cells to replicate thousands of times
faster than they’re accustomed to. The Senator’s body is literally
burning itself out. Scott – this machine kills people and I don’t think
Magneto realizes it.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: So where do you think he’s planning this
larger demonstration?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: There…</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: I wish I could go.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: We all do.</p>
<p><strong>beast</strong>: Storm. Try to look for the highest vantage
point. From what I can figure, he’ll need to gain as much altitude as
possible to blanket the island. It is my feeling that Magneto has
to–</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Beast.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: You can still hear me… can’t you.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Hey. I’m sorry. About Logan. I was
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Well, I think that’s perfectly
understandable.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I’ll tell you one thing though.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: He calls me sport one more time, and I’ll
blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: With the ceremonies beginning shortly,
it looks as though the last of the dignitaries have landed at Newark and
Teterboro airports and will be arriving momentarily. It would seem the
United Nations has had their wish tonight. There doesn’t seem to be an
empty seat in the house.</p>
<p><strong>the flame instantly grows to a raging intensity,</strong>:
ENGULFING THEM.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Radar Stealth Mode checks out. All right,
there’ll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge. I’m
taking her down.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Into the Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: V.T.O.L. off.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: You’re backstage at the encore of
creation.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: In the road to survival, there is always
sacrifice Logan. We are the future… not them. We must protect ourselves.
After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home – They will
return as brothers, as mutants… and our cause will be theirs. This is
survival, I know you understand that, Logan… or is it Wolverine?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Give me your tired, your poor…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The lights on the Statue of Liberty are
off.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Beast said that he would have to take a high
vantage point.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Let’s dock over there.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Liberty One, Liberty One, this
is Horizon, do you copy.</p>
<p><strong>agent’s voice</strong>: Go, Horizon.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Liberty, what’s the situation
with the lights, over?</p>
<p><strong>mystique/agent’s voice</strong>: Uhhh, Horizon, we’ve seem to
have had a shutdown at the generator, we’re five by five. There now,
checking it out. Everything is fine other-wise.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Roger Liberty one. Horizon
out.</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: Darling… We’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: We should check out operations, see if the
Secret Service is still around.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: LOOK OUT.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I’m going to assume that means that the
Secret Service is out of commission. Jean, can you raise me up
there?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: It’s too far.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Storm, Rogue, – you take the south
entrance. Jean and I will go in here.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Be careful everyone… I think we may have
company.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Rogue… run.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Lights on.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Roger. We see the lights.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Don’t you people die?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Jean. Jean stop. Stop moving.</p>
<p><strong>fires a thin, focused optic beam into the encrusted</strong>:
SLIME, splitting it in half. He pulls the remains away from her
face.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I didn’t mean to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Thank God. Logan… we have to help Storm we
have to.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’ll go back, but first let me find you a
safe place.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Mystique… Mystique, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Jean… can you?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m not strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: If the temperature changes a single degree…
I only need one hostage.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: … and I know you can – It is a five minute
run from the furthest distance on this island. If you are not back in
this time… I will kill these friends of Xavier’s. Including the young
lady from the gymnasium. I think they came here to “rescue you”</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Xavier is dying you know. Five minutes
Logan.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Here – Xavier’s life.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Magneto. I’ve seen the results of your
machine. I’ve seen Senator Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Ahhhh, so the good Senator survived his
fall? And the swim to shore? He is stronger than I ever could have
imagined.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The experiment was a failure. Kelly didn’t
make it. Yes, you were successful in activating his mutator gene, but
you failed to take into account the rest of his body – it wasn’t ready
for the strain. Kelly was dead within hours. Your machine kills.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Quiet…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Why can’t you see what I am trying to do?
Why do you stand in my way?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Logan!</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Ahh, there you are.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You have to stop him, the machine… it kills
people…</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: Don’t listen to her… it’s a trap.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>mystique</strong>: This is.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: ROGUE, DESTROY THE MACHINE!</p>
<p><strong>logan yells – the white light begins to emanate from
his</strong>: BODY. His flesh starts to SMOLDER.</p>
<p><strong>operation commander</strong>: Liberty one this is Horizon… I
repeat… do you copy? Liberty one this is Horizon … I repeat… do you
copy?</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Your girlfriend is next.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Jean!</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: Sorry about this sweetheart, but I made
Logan a promise.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hey, ya big pussy.</p>
<p><strong>sabretooth</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Not just me.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Hey… There you are. Is it really you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah, it’s really me.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Come on, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m o.k. I’m o.k.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Sure you are, sport.</p>
<p><strong>agent/mystique</strong>: Hey, could somebody untie me!</p>
<p><strong>secret service man #3</strong>: Hey! Over here.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Even after last weeks terrorist
vandalization of the Statue of Liberty by an unidentified mutant
organization, the outcome of the vote was 51 to 49 in opposition to the
Mutant Registration Act.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Quiet. Quiet everybody.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: This narrow defeat was probably due in
large part to the surprising last- minute reversal by Senator Scott
“Frank” Kelly, who until today provided the loudest voice in the cry for
Mutant Registration. Earlier today, Kelly had this to say:</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: If we can not go into the future together,
the divisions of fear and prejudice will tear this country apart.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: No more questions. Please, no more
questions.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Don’t you knock?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: They’re all asking how you’re doing. Are you
feeling up to saying hello to everyone?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Actually I’m feeling up to leaving.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Why? You have a home here now, if you want
it. Everyone will…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What?… miss me? Charley, I’m gonna walk out
the front door and trust me, it won’t be soon enough for everyone
here.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Of course. Everything in this room is for
you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Thanks, I’ll pay you back.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Well if you’re going to leave then you at
least owe them a goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What’s a guy gotta do to get a beer around
here?</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: I wouldn’t really have let you die, you
know. I just needed…</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: Doesn’t it ever wake you in the middle of
the night? The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass
that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and
your children? Take you all away?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: It does indeed, Max.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: And what do you do when you wake up to
that?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I feel a great swell of pity for the poor
soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>magneto</strong>: But you know that it is a war, old friend.
And to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs, by any
means necessary. And for that reason, I will always have the advantage.
No matter how you trap me, how I am contained -</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: And I will always be there, old friend.</p>
