<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Thebes. City of the Living. Crown jewel of
Pharaoh Seti the First.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Home of Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris,
Keeper of the Dead.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh’s
Mistress. No other man was allowed to touch her.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But for our love, we were willing to risk
life itself.</p>
<p><strong>pharaoh</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>pharaoh</strong>: Imhotep?… My priest.</p>
<p><strong>priests</strong>: Pharaoh’s bodyguards!</p>
<p><strong>anck-su-namun</strong>: You must go. Save yourself. Only you
can resurrect me.</p>
<p><strong>anck-su-namun</strong>: My body is no longer his temple!</p>
<p><strong>narrator/imhotep</strong>: For murdering Pharaoh,
Anck-su-namun’s body was to be cursed. And it was I, the High Priest,
whose duty it was to curse it.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Her body was mummified, her vital organs
removed and placed in sacred canopic jars.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: The Book of The Living contained sacred
incantations that would send the evil dead on a journey into the dark
underworld.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: The slaves were killed…</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: …and the soldiers who killed them were also
slain, so that no unholy person should ever know the exact location of
the burial site.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: But there was another book, The Book Of The
Dead, which was never to be opened, never to be read, for it contained
the incantations that could bring a dead body back to life a most unholy
thing.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of the
Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, so that no such sacrilege might ever
disgrace Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: But for my love of Anck-su-namun I was
willing to defy the gods.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Anck-su-namun’s vital organs were still
fresh, so a human sacrifice would not need be made.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Anck-su-namun soul had come back from the
dead! Now all that was needed, was to return her organs to their
rightful place within her body.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: My Priests were condemned to be mummified
alive.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: As for me, I was condemned to endure the
HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient curses. One so horrible, it had never
before been bestowed.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: By eating the sacred scarabs, I would be
cursed to stay alive forever. And by eating me, they were cursed just
the same.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: I was to remain sealed inside my
sarcophagus, the undead for all of eternity.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: They would never allow me to be released.
For I would arise a walking disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy
flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power over the sands, and the
glory of invincibility.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
su-namun from her place in hell, together, we would be an unstoppable
infection upon this world. The Apocalypse. The End.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I knew this was gonna be a lousy day.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can
we not just surrender?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Then let’s run away. Right now. While we can
still make it.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Now gimme your revolver, you’ll never use
it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Then let’s play dead, huh? Nobody ever does
that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Now go find me a big stick.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: In the desert? What for?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: So I can tie it to your back, you appear
to be without a spine.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: How’d a guy like you end up in the Legion
anyways?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good
stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who’s
guarding them?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Altar boys?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Exactly! I speak seven languages, including
Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill
somebody?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: No, but I’m considering it.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: None of the above, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Then what the hell are you doing here!?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I was just looking for a good time.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Oh shit. Steady!</p>
<p><strong>steady!</strong>: What the hell am I sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>steady!!</strong>: What the hell am I doin’?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Hey! Beni! Wait up!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What are ya doing?! Wait up!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Don’t you close that door! DON’T YOU</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I’m gonna get you for this!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Tuthmosis?… Now how did you get up here?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! Give me
frogs, flies, locusts, anything but this! Compared to you, the other
plagues were a joy!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m sorry, it was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an
accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You put up with me, because I can read and
write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I’m the
only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and
catalogue this library.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Who needs smart women? I put up with you
because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their
souls. Now straighten up this mess!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You…! YOU…!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call
me something original.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Have you no respect for the dead?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Right now, I only wish to join them.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Well I wish you’d do it sooner rather than
later, before you ruin my career the way you’ve ruined yours.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: My dear, sweet, baby sister, I’ll have you
know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: High note? Ha! For five years you’ve been
scrounging around Egypt, and what have you to show for it? Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh yes I do! I have something right
here!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh no, not another worthless trinket,
Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and
sell for you.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: On a dig, down in Thebes.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: My whole life I’ve never found anything,
Evy. Tell me I’ve found something.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Jonathan?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I think you found something.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: See the cartouche there, it’s the official
royal seal of Seti the First, I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the
First? And was he rich?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom,
said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Alright, good, that’s good. I like this
fellow, like him very much.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’ve already dated it, this map is almost
four thousand years old. And the hieratics over here… It’s
Hamunaptra.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: My dear girl, don’t be ridiculous, we are
scholars, not treasure hunters. Hamunaptra is a myth.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early
Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Right, right, in a big underground
treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was
rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh’s command, a flick of the
switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: All we know is that the city mysteriously
vanished around 2,134</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: As the Americans would say: it’s all fairy
tales and hokum.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You burned it! You burned off the part
with the lost city!</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: It’s for the best, I’m sure. Many men have
wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no one has ever
found it, most have never returned.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You killed my map.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: I’m sure it was a fake, anyway, I’m
surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to be so fooled.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You told me you found it on a dig down in
Thebes!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I was mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You lied to me!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I lie to everybody, what makes you so
special?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m your sister.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: That just makes you more gullible.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You stole it from a drunk at the local
Casbah?!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Picked his pocket, actually.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And what is he in prison for?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I did not know, so when I heard you were
coming, I asked him that myself.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: He said… he was just looking for a good
time.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: But he’s just a filthy criminal?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Way to go, Evy.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: So who’s the broad?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Broad?!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: She’s my sister, actually.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah? Well,… I’m sure she’s not a total
loss.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I’ll be back in a moment.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I tremble with anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: We uh,… found… your puzzle box, and we’ve
come to ask you about it.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: No… You came to ask me about
Hamunaptra.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: How do you know the box pertains to
Hamunaptra?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Because that’s where I found it. I was
there.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: How do we know that’s not a load of pig
swallow?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Hey,… don’t I know you?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Um, well, you see…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You were actually at Hamunaptra?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I just decked your brother</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes, well… I know my brother.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah, I was there.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You swear?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Every damn day.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No, I mean –</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: – I know what you mean. I was there,
alright. Seti’s place. The City Of The Dead.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What did you find? What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I found sand. I saw death.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Could you tell me how to get there? The
exact location?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Want to know?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Really want to know?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Then get me the hell outta here.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Where are they taking him?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: To be hanged.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Apparently, he had a very good time.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: No women allowed.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I am an English woman.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I will give you one hundred pounds to spare
his life.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I would pay one hundred pounds just to see
him hang.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Two hundred pounds.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Proceed!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Three hundred pounds!</p>
<p><strong>hangman</strong>: Any last requests, pig?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah, I’d like ya to let me go.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: And what else?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: His neck did not break! Good! Now we watch
him strangle to death.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He knows the location to Hamunaptra.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: You lie.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I would never!</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Are you saying this filthy godless son of a
pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes and if you cut him down, we will give
you ten percent.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Fifty percent.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Forty.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Give… give him… give him GLAAAA– !</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Twenty-five percent, and not one single
farthing more.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: She must die.</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: She is like all the others. She will die in
the desert.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: No! She has seen too much. She knows too
much.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Not only does she have a map, but she has
the key.</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: The key!? She has the lost key!?</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so
close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: Then we will kill her, we will kill her and
all those with her.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: And burn the map and retrieve the key.</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: It will be done. But what of the American
expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be
like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they
possibly find Hamunaptra?</p>
<p><strong>smash cut to</strong>: our old traitorous friend BENI.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: It is three days down the Nile, then two days
by camel, sahibs.</p>
<p><strong>we crane back</strong>: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of
a PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: For all the money we’re paying you,
something better god-damned well be under that sand.</p>
<p><strong>we keep craning back</strong>: as Henderson slaps Daniels on
the back.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: “Hamunaptra,” Daniels, that’s all ya
gotta keep sayin, to yourself, “Hamunaptra.”</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Do you really think he’ll show up?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a
cowboy, but his word is his word.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Personally, I think he’s filthy, rude and a
complete scoundrel. I don’t like him one bit.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Anyone I know?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh… um,… hello.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Smashing day for the start of an
adventure, eh, O’Connell?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah, sure, smashing.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’re sure Hamunaptra is out there?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Along with the scorched bones of my entire
garrison, sahib.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: A thousand pardons, my good sahibs but there
is much work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>back down with</strong>: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her
throat.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Mister O’Connell, can you look me in the
eye, and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam? Because if it
is, I’m warning you –</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: All I can tell you, miss, is that my
Colonel found that map in an ancient fortress, and the whole damn
garrison believed in it so much, that without orders, we marched halfway
across Libya and into Egypt to find that city. Like I told ya, all I saw
was sand. Everybody else was wiped out by Tuareg warriors. I’ll take
your bags.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes, yes, you’re right, filthy, rude, a
complete scoundrel, nothing to like there at all.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: A bright good morning to all.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I have come to protect my investment, thank
you very much.</p>
<p><strong>we go wide again</strong>: as the barge pulls out and heads
down the Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into –</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sit down, O’Connell, sit down, we could
use another good player.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I only gamble with my life, never my
money.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Never? What if I were to wager five hundred
dollars says we get to Hamunaptra before you?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yer on.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What makes you so confident, sir?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What makes you?</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: We got us a man who’s actually been
there.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I say, what a coincidence, why –</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: – whose deal is it? Is it my deal? I
thought I just dealt?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Sorry, didn’t mean to scare ya.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The only thing that scares me, Mister
O’Connell, are your manners.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: If you call that a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Did I miss something? Are we going into
battle?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: The last time I was at that place
everybody I was with died.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: There’s something out there, you know,
something under that sand.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes, I’m hoping to find a certain artifact,
a book, actually, my brother thinks there’s treasure. What do you think
is out there?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe
that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, “the doorway to hell.”</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Ahmar is Ossirion. “Passageway to the
underworld”, actually.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I don’t believe in fairy tales and hokum,
Mister O’Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in
history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It’s what first
interested me in Egypt as a child. It’s why I came here, sort of a
life’s pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: And the fact that they say it’s made out
of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You know your history.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I know my treasure.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: By the way,… why did you kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I was about to be hanged, seemed like a
good idea at the time.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What?… Wha’d I say?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: My very good friend! What a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Why if it ain’t my little buddy, Beni. I
oughta kill you.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: You never were any good with the ladies,
O’Connell.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: So you’re the one leading the Americans,
I shoulda figured. So what’s the scam? You get ’em out in the middle of
the desert then leave ’em to rot?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart,
they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must
go all the way.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: You never believed in Hamunaptra, O’Connell.
Why are you going back? The devil himself lives out there.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: The girl saved my life, figured it was
the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: You always did have more balls than
brains.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Let’s make us even, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Even?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: O’Connell! I am going to kill you for
this!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: Where is the map?</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: And the key? Where is the key?</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: Then I’ll find it myself.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The map! We need the map!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Relax! I’m the map! It’s all up here.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh that’s comforting.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: C’mon, there’s still one more of those
guys around here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hey that’s mine –</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Can you swim?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Well of course I can swim, if the occasion
calls for it.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: The occasion calls for it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Americans.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I say! Good show!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And did I panic?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I think not.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Hey O’Connell! Looks to me like I got all the
horses!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the
wrong side of the river!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I can’t believe the price of these
fleabags.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: We coulda had ’em for free, all we had to
do was give ’em your sister.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes, awfully tempting, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Awfully.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Then again…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Never did like camels. Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit. Disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah, disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Well I think they’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>we do several time dissolves</strong>: showing the majesty of
the desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And you snore!</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I do not snore!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: All night you snored!</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I have never snored!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Pretty sure.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What in bloody hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Other seekers of Hamunaptra.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Good morning, my friend!</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Well, what the hell we doin’?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Patience, my good sahib, patience.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: First one to the city, O’Connell! Five
hundred! Cash bucks!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Get ready.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: We’re about to be shown the way.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn’t we
be going?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: After all, you rode us night and day to win
that bet.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Fools.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Evelyn! Slow down!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You boys owe me five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Where’d all these camels come from?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: They belong to the dead. They will wait years
for their masters to return before leaving.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: That thing gives me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Be nice. That thing saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: That “thing” gets me excited.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: The things that get you excited.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the
statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book
Of The Living.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What are those mirrors for?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Ancient Egyptian trick. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Do you realize, we are standing inside a
room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Who cares? I don’t see no treasure.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You’re welcome to my share of the spider
webs.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And it stinks to high heaven in here.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Cretins.</p>
<p><strong>disk to another until the whole chamber is lit up.
light</strong>: RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It’s the embalmer’s
chamber.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: That is a neat trick.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh my god, It’s a preparation room.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Preparation for what?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: For entering the afterlife.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Mummies, my good son, this is where they
made the mummies.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Ya scared the bejeezus out of us,
O’Connell.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: This here is our statue,… friend.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Don’t see your name on it,… pal.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Ten to one, O’Connell, your odds are
no-so-good.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I’ve had worse.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes, me too.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Let’s be nice, children, if we’re going to
play together, we must learn to share.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: According to my calculations, we should be
right under the statue. We’ll come up right between his legs. Oh my.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep –
No offense.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: None taken.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: We’ll sneak up and steal that book right
out from under them.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: And you’re sure you can find the secret
compartment?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn’t already
found it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I say, what’s our smelly little friend got
himself up to?</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: Seti was no fool.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Yeah, sure…</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: We’ll let him open it.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Lemme get this straight, they stuck a
sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces,
then ripped it all out through your nostrils?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: OWCH! That’s really got to hurt.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It’s called mummification. You’re dead when
they do this</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Still…</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah, that’d bring you back to life.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You two are worse than a couple of
schoolboys.</p>
<p><strong>– an intense burst of liquid sprays out of the seam.
hits</strong>: THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They
SCREAM.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh my god,… it looks like, it looks like a
sarcophagus.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Why would they bury somebody in the
ceiling?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: They didn’t, they buried him at the foot of
Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something
very naughty.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: the scarab on the floor. It begins to
TRANSFORM.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well?… Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: ‘He that shall not be named.’</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: There’s some sort of lock here. You say
these thing’s are made of granite with a steel interior?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Whoever’s in here, sure wasn’t getting
out.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: No kiddin’, without a key, it’ll take us
a month to crack this thing,</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: A key! That’s it! That’s what he was talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Who was talking about what?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The man on the barge. The one with the hook,
he was looking for a key.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hey that’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What do you suppose killed him?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Did you ever see him eat?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Seems the Americans had a little
misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some
sort of ancient booby-trap.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Maybe this place really is cursed.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You two!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You don’t believe in curses, huh?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No. I believe if I can see it and I can
touch it, then it’s real. That’s what I believe.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I believe in being prepared.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Seagrams!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well, he may have been a stinky fellow,…
but he had good taste.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Stay here!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Evy! Excuse me! But didn’t the man just
say – !</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Goin’ somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Just looking for you, O’Connell! I wanted to
be with my friend!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: C’mon, friend.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Why do you like to fight so much?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: ’Cause I look good doin, it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Let ’em have it, boys!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I say, bloody good show.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes,… fine,… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: See! That proves it! Old Seti’s fortune’s
gotta be under this sand!</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: For them to protect it like this, you
just know there’s got to be treasure down there.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: These men are a desert people. They value
water, not gold.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Where’s Jonathan?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Unlike my brother, sir, I know when to say
no.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don’t
get. You’re a whole new brew.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I know, you’re wondering, what’s a place
like me doing in a girl like this?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous
explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother!
Who was quite an adventurer herself</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Okay, I get your father, I get your
mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer,
or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O’Connell But I’m proud of
what I am.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: And what is that?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: …I am a librarian!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m going to kiss you, Mister O’Connell.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Not unless you call me Rick.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Because that’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I can’t believe I allowed the two of you to
get me drunk.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Don’t blame me, I don’t even remember
being there.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Well neither do I, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No… Why?… Should I?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best
time you ever had.</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: There is a curse upon this chest.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Curse my ass.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Yeah, who cares.</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: In these hallowed grounds, that which
was set forth in ancient times, is as strong today, as it was then.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Yeah, yeah, okay, what’s it –</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: “Death will come on swift wings to
whomever opens this chest”.</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: It says, there is one, the undead, who
if brought back to life, is bound by sacred law to consummate this
curse.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Yeah, well, let’s just make sure we don’t
bring anybody back from the dead then, huh?</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: He will kill all who open this chest,…
and assimilate their organs and fluids.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Assimilate their organs and fluids? Ya mean
eat ’em?</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: And in so doing he will regenerate.
And no longer be the undead, but a plague upon this earth.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Ah hell, let’s open it anyways.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh my god, I’ve dreamed about this ever
since I was a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You dream about dead guys?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Look, all the sacred spells have been
chiseled off. The hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on
his journey into the afterlife, they’ve been removed. This man was
cursed,… doomed.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Tough break.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes, I’m all tears, now let’s see who’s
inside, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: The curse,… beware the curse!</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Stupid superstitious bastard.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Is he supposed to look like that?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No. I’ve never seen a mummy look like this.
He’s, he’s still…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Juicy?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes. He’s more than four thousand years old
and still decomposing.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: And look at this.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh my god, he was buried alive.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And he left a message.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It says: ‘Death is only the beginning.’</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Where’s my gun?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What are you going to do? Shoot him?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: If he decides to wake up, hell yes!</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: I have heard told of this book, but I
never truly believed it existed. This, good gentlemen, is a most
priceless treasure.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: I wouldn’t trade ya for a brass
spittoon!</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Yeah! It’s supposed to be made outta pure
gold!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What is this stuff? It smells like our
late friend, the Warden.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You did not!?… We’re not!?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste
worse, but that’s the best the desert has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Say O’Connell, whadaya think these
honey’s’ll fetch back home?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: We hear you gentlemen found yerselves a nice
gooey mummy. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Ya know if ya dry him out, you can sell him
for firewood.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them inside
our friend’s coffin. They can stay alive for years living off the flesh
of a corpse, or in this case…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Famished.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Are you saying somebody threw these
things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: He certainly was not a popular fellow when
they planted him.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Must of got a little too frisky with the
Pharaoh’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: According to my readings, our friend
suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one
reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I’ve
never read of this curse actually having been performed.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: That bad huh?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes, they never used it because they feared
it so. It’s written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise,
he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: The ten plagues?… You mean all ten
plagues.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh
guy?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: That’s one way of putting it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Let’s see, there was frogs, flies,
locusts…</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hail and fire.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: The sun turning black.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Water turning to blood.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And my personal favorite: people covered
in boils and sores.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Fried gizzard anyone?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You sure you outta be playin, around with
that?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It’s just a book, no harm ever came from a
book.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.</p>
<p><strong>egyptologist</strong>: What have we done?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions
of grasshoppers!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: That’s one of the plagues, right? The
grasshopper plague!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: This is not a plague. It’s generational.
Every so many years the locusts of Egypt have a population explosion and
they all take flight.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Okay,… and what about frogs?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Daniels! Henderson!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Daniels?… is that you?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Henderson?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh thank goodness, you’re one of the
Americans, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Anck-su-namun?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Damn-it! Must be a trap door around here
or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Help me,… please,… help me.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Would you quit playin, around! Let’s get
outta here already!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Ahhhhhhhh!!</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: I told you to leave or die, you refused,
and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature
that we have feared for more than four thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Relax, I got him.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: No mortal weapons can kill this
creature. He is not of this world.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Are we talkin, about the same creature?
The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: May the good Lord protect and watch over me as
a shepherd watches over his flock. And may Satan in all his forms be
vanquished forever.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: The language of the slaves.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: I may have use for you. And the rewards
will be great.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Where are the other sacred jars?</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: You bastards!</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: What did you do to him!?</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: We saved him! Saved him before the
creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before
he finishes you all.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You’re not going to kill us?</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: We must now hunt him down, and try and
find a way to kill him, before he consumes the earth. Allah be with
us.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I told ya, I already got him!</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Know this, the creature will be coming
for you. He must consummate the curse. And until he does, he will never
eat, he will never sleep, and he will never stop.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I thought you didn’t believe in this
stuff!?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Having an encounter with a four thousand
year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Forget it, we’re out the door down the
hall and gone.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No, we are not.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Oh yes we are.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No we are not. We woke him up, and we must
try and stop him.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: We?! What we?! You didn’t read that book.
I told you not to play around with that thing.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Alright then, Me, I,… I read the book, I
woke him up and I intend to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: How!? You heard the man, no mortal
weapons can kill this guy.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Then we’ll have to find some immortal
ones.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: There goes that belief again. Not me, I
am outta here!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: According to that Book, once this creature
has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so
will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth
is destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah? So? Is that my problem?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It’s everybody’s problem!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Look lady, I appreciate you saving my
life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and
bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story,
contract terminated.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: That’s what I am to you? A contract?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You can either tag along with me, or you
can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you
slink off to?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: You left me! You left me in the desert to
rot.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Oh yeah,… sorry bout that. So who’s this
guy?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of
Osiris.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Oh, hey, how ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: The Prince does not like to be touched by
other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Yeah, well, we all got our little
problems today don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I
feel responsible.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Don’t gimme that, you never had any
scruples.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Do you know where I can steal some?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: See ya around, Padre.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: I’m the last of the Royal Force still
stationed here, you know? All the other laddies died in the air and were
buried in the sand.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Ever since the end of the Great War, there
hasn’t been a single challenge worthy of a man like me.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I’ve heard it before, Winston.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: I just wish I would’ve chucked it with the
other laddies, gone down in a flame of glory, instead of sitting around
here, rotting from boredom and booze!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: The drawer there, spectacles. As you see, I
won’t be needing them.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks you for
your spectacles, – and for your eyes,… and for your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: But I am afraid more is needed, the Prince
says he must finish the job, consummate the curse which you and your
friends have brought down upon yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,…
like…</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Blood.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: “And the rivers and waters of Egypt went
red and were as blood.”</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Who’s here!?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: We got problems.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: He’s here! I saw him! That thing is
here!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The creature!? Are you sure!?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Pretty sure!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: We are in serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Back off, creep.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: You saved me from the undead. For this, I
shall make you immortal.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: The curse. The curse.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: There’s only one person I know who can
possibly give us some answers.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What is he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Do you truly wish to know? Or would you
prefer to just shoot us?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I just saw my fist vanish into some guy’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I’m willin, to go on a little faith,
here.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: You will not believe it.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: We are part of an ancient secret society,
the cult-of-the-Mumia, and we have a sacred mission, passed down through
thirty-nine generations. For over four thousand years we have guarded
The City Of The Dead. we are sworn at manhood to do any and all in our
power to stop the High Priest Imhotep from being reborn into this
world.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: And because of you, we have failed.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And you think this justifies killing
innocent people!?</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: To have stopped this creature? Yes!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Okay, let’s cut to the chase. He’s afraid
of cats, what’s that about?</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: According to the ancients, cat’s are the
guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until
he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Right! And ya know how he gets fully
regenerated?! By killing everybody who opened that chest and sucking us
dry! That’s how!</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Yes, the creature must first try and
regenerate, and then he will attempt to resurrect the one he has loved
for more than four thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Anck-su-namun.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,…
walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns’ quarters
he tried to kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: It is because it was you who read from the
Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate
the body of Anck-su-namun.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: This is not good. Not good at all.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Tonight is the full moon. The moon of
Osiris. It will begin tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: “…and he stretched forth his hands towards
the heavens, and there was darkness throughout the land of Egypt.”</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: We must stop him from regenerating.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Who opened that chest?</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Well, there was me and Daniels here and
then poor Burns of course, oh yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What about my buddy, Beni?</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Naw, he scrammed outta there,</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: We must find the Egyptologist and bring him
back here to the safety of the fort, before the creature can get to
him.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Okay,… Evelyn, you wait here, you two
come with me.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: The hell with that! I’m not goin’
nowhere! We’re safe here.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Yeah, I’m not leavin, this fort for
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Who put you in charge? You can’t just leave
me behind like some old suitcase. I’m the one responsible for this mess
and I intend to be the one to clean it up.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Keep an eye on her. If you leave her
door, I’ll rip your spleen out. C’mon, Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Well, well, well.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Lemme guess, spring cleaning?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Where’s your new friend?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: What friend? You’re my only friend.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Then you got no excuse for living. What
the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What’s in it for
you?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: It is better to be the right hand of the
Devil,… than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Immune from what?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: You shall see.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What are you looking for? Lie, and I’ll
slit your throat.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: The book! The black book they found at
Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it’s
weight in diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What does he want the book for?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Something about bringing his dead girly-friend
back to life. He needs the book… And your sister.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: That looked rather painful.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck
has been for crap.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes, I know, I do that to people.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Damn-it! That’s two down and only two to
go.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And then he’ll be coming after Evy.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Ten o’clock! All is well!</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: The hell with this. I’m goin, downstairs to
get me a drink. You want somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot
of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.</p>
<p><strong>the door</strong>: The mound of sand is gone and in it’s
place is Imhotep.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Get your hands off my girl, pal.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Nice lips.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I figured you might be here, so I brought
a friend.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You called me your girl?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What?… Oh yeah, that was just um, you
know, figure a speech.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I think you were jealous</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Jealous? You kiddin’ me? Did you see that
guy’s face?</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do
somethin’! we gotta do somethin, NOW! Before it’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Last month I came across an inscription that
mentioned The Book Of The Dead.</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: That book we found at Hamunaptra?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked about
bringing people back from the dead. A notion I was unwilling to
believe.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Believe it, sister. That’s what brought
our buddy back to life.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And now he’s going to use it to bring his
girlfriend back</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: And if he succeeds, the two of them
together will bring about the apocalypse.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: The plagues we have seen so far, are
merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. Only at the moment of
Anck-su-namun’s resurrection will he be truly invincible.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m thinking that if the black Book Of The
Dead can bring people back to life –</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: – then perhaps, the golden Book Of The
Living can return them to the underworld.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Exactly –</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: So your sayin’, if we find the book made
outta gold –</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: – And read the sacred incantations
contained inside it.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You think it’ll send this guy back to
hell?</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Correct, And that’s when –</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: It has begun. The beginning of the
end.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Not quite yet it hasn’t. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Got what?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Since the black Book of The Dead was found
inside the statue of Anubis, then according to this, the golden Book of
The Living should be inside…</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The golden Book Of The Living, is inside the
statue of Horus.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Which would be located not far to the east
of the Anubis statue.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Don’t tell me we gotta go back out
there?</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: If we want to kill the creature, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Imhotep! IMHOTEP!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You’re gonna get yours, pal!</p>
<p><strong>we cut wide</strong>: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed,
diseased mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM…</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: C’mon! C’mon! Let’s go! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He’s gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: He has consummated the curse, now all
he need do is raise Anck-su-namun from the dead, then it will be the end
of us, and the beginning for them.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Koontash dai na.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Take his hand and he will spare the
others.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Any bright ideas?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Sorry, fresh out.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Don’t do it, Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Come with me my princess. It is time to make
you mine, forever.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: All eternity, idiot.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You better think of something, because if he
turns me into a mummy, you’re the first one I’m coming after.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Got guts, lady.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes, I know, and I’d like to keep them.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hey that’s mine – !</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Evelyn!</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Be calm. There is still time. We can
stop him yet.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Pared oos.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Kill them.</p>
<p><strong>curator</strong>: Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: We gotta get her back.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m with you, old man. No one touches my
sister like that and gets away with it.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You know where he’s taking her?</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the
ritual.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And what ritual would that be?</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
su-namun back to life.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And how does one do that?</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: By reading the Book Of The Dead.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: And then killing your sister.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Imhotep is now able to cross the desert
with great haste.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Begging your pardon, but I wasn’t quite
clear on that last part.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: If he arrives before us, it will be too
late.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Did you say ‘kill’ my sister?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I know how to beat him to it.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: So what’s your little problem got to do
with His Majesty’s Royal Air Corp?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Not a god-damned thing.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Is it dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: You probably won’t live through it.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: By Jove, do you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Everybody else we’ve bumped into has died,
why not you?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: So what’s the challenge then?</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: To save the damsel in distress, kill the
bad guy and steal his treasure.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Winston Havlock at your service, sir!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: All I remember is him turning into a blast of
sand,… and then I remember nothing.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Hang on, men!</p>
<p><strong>we go wide as</strong>: The sandstorm chases the diving,
twisting biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: We’re going down!</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Here I come, laddies!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Stop it! You’ll kill them!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Excuse me… A little help would be useful…
IF IT’S NOT TOO MUCH</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Okay, now what the hell does this Horus
guy look like?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: He’s a big fellow with pointy ears and a
face like a falcon.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You know, nasty little fellows such as
yourself, always get their comeuppance.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh yes, always.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I say, look at that.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Say, gents! You should come have a look at
this.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: From now on, don’t touch anything. Not a
damn thing. Keep your hands off the furniture, got it?</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Prince Imhotep wants your heart.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Tell him, I’m truly flattered… but that it’s
already taken.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: He wants your heart and your brain, your
liver, your kidneys…</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: …and how do you say? Those slimy things, in
your stomach?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Intestines.</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Yeah! Them.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You only want me for my organs?!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Who the hell are these guys?</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Priests. Imhotep’s priests.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: I never killed a priest before.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: They are evil, cursed, they matter
not.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Well, okay then.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Oh come on, gimme a break here.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: Kill them! Kill them all! And bring me the
Book Of The Living!</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: My turn.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: This whole place is comin, alive!</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello Horus old boy.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: These guys just don’t quit.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Keep digging!</p>
<p><strong>an intense burst of acid sprays out of the seam and hits
all</strong>: THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it
in the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.</p>
<p><strong>ardeth ray</strong>: Save the girl! Kill the creature!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: That’s the last one, we better get
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>imhotep</strong>: With your death, my love and I will be
invincible!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I found it, Evy! I found it</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Shut-up and get me off of here!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Open the book, Jonathan! Open the book!
That’s the only way to kill him!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I can’t open it! It’s locked or
something!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: We need the key!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Read the inscription on the cover!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Keetash-something, naraba-something.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm – ?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: This just keeps gettin, better and
better.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You have got to be joking?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Finish the inscription, idiot!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Ummm, Hootash im… Hootash im now what is
this last symbol here?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What’s it look like!?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It’s an Anck symbol, with two little
squiggly lines above it, and a bird, a stork! on either side.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes,… I see.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hootash im Ahmenophus!</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Okay pal, let’s see how tough you are
without your right arm.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Alright,… so he’s left handed.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I got it!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Death is only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>beni</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well,… I guess we go home empty
handed.</p>
<p><strong>o’connell</strong>: Wouldn’t say that.</p>
