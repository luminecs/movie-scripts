<p><strong>1 a prologue 1</strong>: crawls up the screen – with
Narrator.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In May 1900, Fidel Castro – in an effort
to normalize relations with the Carter Administration – opened the
harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of
his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-
two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks,
it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back
with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population.
3y the time the port was closed 125,000 ‘Marielitos’ had landed in
Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of
that minority – those they call ‘Los Bandidos.’</p>
<p><strong>2 the disembarkation 2</strong>: from the harbor in Mariel,
Cuba. Vessels of every nature, waving masses, demonstrations….</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: . 3</p>

packed with the harder-looking refugee-types. The windows are caged and
we see INS guards. level is high, like a sack of monkeys. Manny Ribera’s
got his feet up on an empty seat. He’s big, strong, handsome, with
dashing darkly feminine eyes – younger than Tony, and dapper in his
cheap clothing. He’s eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.</p>

clouds.. .past a giant billboard:</p>

crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and casual Cubans in sports clothes
bunched in conversations around their wheels or at the ice cream

something soon. I didn’t come to America to break my fucking back,
querido.</p>
<p><strong>29 int./ext. little havana restaurant - night - hours
later</strong>: we are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes, diamonds
and – the mark of status – large bodyguards. They’re out front with the
flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with
the waitresses. Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
M–q, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yeah, look at the punk with her. What’s he got
that I don’t got?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Junkie! – They got no fuckin’ character. Cono!

<p><strong>tony</strong>: El Mono? Shit….</p>
<p><strong>30 ext. parking lot outside little havana restaurant - night
30’</strong>: Omar Suarez is so named ’cause he looks like one. Nervous,
crooked, darting eyes, feverish intelligence, constantly smoking a
cigarette and coughing between words, his face pock-marked and pitted
like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the
wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor…with him is Waldo
Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he’s amiable,
heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: I got something for you.</p>
<p>****: We gotta unload a boat – grass, twenty- five tons – that’s what
we gotta do. You get five hundred each.</p>

coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and
if it’s what they say it is, pay ’em and bring it back. You do that,
you’ll make five grand.</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: You know how to handle a machine gun?</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: You’re gonna need a couple other guys….</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: Meet me at Hector’s bodega Friday at noon. You
get the money then. Some- thing happens to the money, pobrecito, and my
boss’ gonna stick your head up your asses faster’n a rabbit gets
fucked.</p>
<p><strong>#02154 20-a</strong>: Rev. 11/Z/82</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>30 continued - 3</strong>: 30</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You worry too much Manny – you’ re gonna get
yourself a heart attack one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: So what does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: So nothin’. I just don’t like fuckin’
Columbians that’s what. They’re animals!</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty
of plates here.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Wash yourself. I just retired.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: What the fuck you gonna do!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Look after my investments.</p>
<p><strong>ext. miami 3each - day - moving shot</strong>: 31 31</p>
<p><strong>32 beach - day 32</strong>: seen from the inside of the
sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette
tensely. Driving is Manny. In the delapidated backseat are Angel, the
baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.</p>
<p><strong>chi-c?xi</strong>: Whatta you crazy? She’s 103 year6 old.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Drive, willya.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Ah, it’s okay. I just y’know forgot to make
an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and
Chango like nobody y’ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>ancel</strong>: Chango looking out for all the ‘bandidos’
everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y’know. You gotta let him

<p><strong>tony</strong>: shaddup – all of ya! I told</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Okay, this is it. Pull over across the

<p><strong>tony</strong>: Let’s go….</p>
<p><strong>ext. sun-ray motel - day</strong>: 33 33</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. toad’s motel room - day 34</strong>: The door’s
opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four- inch Columbian, “The
Toad”. He’s in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester
pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he’s good-natured, a nice
guy, he smiles.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Hey, oye amigo….</p>
<p><strong>35 int. toad’s motel room - day 35</strong>: Tony, stepping
into the conventionally tasteless orange and blue motel room , spreads
his hands in a similar posture inducating he too is not carrying; but
this is only symbolic, it’s not meant to be a body search.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: How you doing amigo…?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know
everything’s okay… okay?</p>
<p><strong>`to@</strong>: problem… This is Marta.</p>

watch.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. toad’s motel room - day 40</strong>: Angel hangs
suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs
straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: You watch what happens to your friend okay? If
you don’t want this to happen to you, you get the money.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Now the leg, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>40 continued 40</strong>: A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by

horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. sun-ray motel - day 41</strong>: Manny, definitely
suspecting something now, moves with Chi-Chi across the parking lot of
the Sun-Ray Motel. They signal and separate.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. toad’s motel room - day 42</strong>: The Toad turns
off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel’s blood,
totally unaffected. He looks at Tony. Tony glances back at him with
fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Okay, my ‘caracortada’, you can die too. Makes
no difference to me.</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. sun-ray motel - day 43</strong>: Manny moves crouched
down the exterior corridor, Ingram pistol in hand, past an older couple

listens….</p>
<p><strong>44 int. toad’s motel room - ’day 44</strong>: The kids are
starting to strap Tony up to the top of the shower. The Lizard watches
from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.</p>

<p><strong>45 continued 45</strong>: Chi-Chi climbing through the window
fires at him.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I got him!</p>
<p><strong>46 ext. sun-ray motel - day 46</strong>: The senior citizens,
playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter in astonishment. As the Toad
staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand,
moving like a jerky chicken.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Your’turn, cabron!…</p>
<p><strong>ext. 47</strong>: Tony intersects holding side,</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Manny, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Chi-Chi, get the car. Fast!</p>
<p><strong>chi-chi</strong>: Si!</p>
<p><strong>48 int. toad’s motel room 48</strong>: Tony strides into the
shambles of Room 9, past the bodies and busted furniture to the suitcase
on the bed from which the Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still
plays in the corner. Inside are several kilo-sized</p>

<p><strong>elvira</strong>: Come on, Frank, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lopez</strong>: let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. the babylon club - nigxt 54</strong>: .We know this
is no workingman’s dive when Lopez piles them out of his Rolls, and the
carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamberghinis and Corniches in a long
snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver
lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back
and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their
Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. babylon club - night 55</strong>: The interior is
built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three
separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars,
twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video
games, computers and a restaurant. Itrs a lavish fun spot that will play
a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of
South America.</p>
<p><strong>55 continued 55</strong>: The waitresses, mostly blondes,
wear little coca channel hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants
with hose and high heels.</p>

<p><strong>lopez</strong>: …the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho
Contreras – El Gordo. Wouldn’t know it to look at him but he’s got more
cash than anybody in here. A real haza….</p>
<p><strong>lopez</strong>: . ..you know what a haza is, Tony?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: ‘Haza’? No Frank, what’s a haza?</p>
<p><strong>lopez</strong>: It’s Yiddish for pig. It’s a guy he’s got
more’n what he needs, so he don’t fly straight anymore, y’know. That’s
the problem in this business, Tony, there’s too many ‘hazas’ and they’re
the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra
dime, they’ll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for
the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy,
never forget it! Lesson number one – don’t under- estimate the other
guy’s greed.</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: Lesson number two – don’t get high on your
own supply.</p>
<p><strong>#02154 40-a</strong>: Rev. 12/9/82</p>

<p><strong>elvira</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>lopez</strong>: Go on!</p>
<p><strong>58 int. babylon club - night 58</strong>: It’s interesting to
watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It’s not so much an act of
walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off
that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes
forward. It’s not that he doesn’t see the people he bumps off, it’s that
he couldn’t care less.</p>
<p><strong>lopez</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: I think he’s a fucking peasant.</p>
<p><strong>lopez</strong>: Yeah – but you get guys like that on your
side, they break their backs for you.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. babylon club dance floor - night 59</strong>: Tony
and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel dance tune. Be’s
no great shakes as a dancer, leaden in the legs and shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …so what’s your name, Elvira what?</p>
<p><strong>59 continued 59</strong>: ELVIm</p>

something. So where you from?</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: Baltimore….</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Baltimore? Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: Look, it doesn’t really matter. I’m getting
a headache.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Just trying to be friendly.</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: I’ve got enough friends – and I don’t need
another one, ’specially one who just got off the banana boat.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey, I didn’t come over on no banana boat. I’m
a political refugee here.</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: Oh, part of the Cuban crime wave?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Whatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter
with.you?</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: .. .I’m sorry. I didn’t know you</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …Why you got this beef against the world? You
got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you
got this look in your eyes like you haven’t been fucked good in a year.
What’s the problem, baby?</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: You know you’re even stupider than you look.
Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know
what you’re doing around here.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Now you’re talking to me, baby!</p>
<p><strong>elvira</strong>: First who, where, why and how I fuck is none
of your business, second don’t call me ‘baby,’ I’m not your baby and
last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a
desert island, you’d be the last thing I’d ever fuck. You got the
picture now – so fuck off.</p>

<p><strong>cochabamba, boliva</strong>: Alejandro Sosa is a playboy,
about six-foot-two, black wavy hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan,
the clothes, a casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin
Klein.</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: so this and my other factory 1 can</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same
problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month….</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: …Basically what I’m looking for is somebody to
share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me
something like-.-say 150 kilos a month.</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: That’s a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It’s too bad
Frank’s not here. Something like that you should talk to him. .</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: Yes, it would’ve been nice if he could have
come.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: and he’d like meeting you too</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: measure of Tony,</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yeah, something like that. You sure got good
stuff in there Mr. Sosa – class A shit.</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: We’ll talk at my house. Shall we go….</p>
<p><strong>94 int. sosa villa - bolivia - day 94</strong>: The camera
moves past a spectacular view of the mountains to a cavernous dining
room highlighted by huge paintings from the Spanish classical period and
ornate candelabra. At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits
impas- sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and
Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the
silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in. He eats the salmon off a
silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants
move to and fro, con- stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony .</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: …say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for
a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as
little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 94 94</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: Well, we do that we gotta take the risk of
moving it. Also we’d be cutting out the Columbians. You know what that
means?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That means we gotta go to war with `em.</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: When we cut out.the Coluxnbians we take risks
– on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far
as Panama.</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: Panama? Risky? It costs me more. There I’d
sell maybe 13.5 a key.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: 13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take
the shit to Florida. You know what that’s like these days? They got the
Navy all over the fuckin’ place. They got frogmen, they got EC 2s with
satellite tracking shit in ‘em, they got fuckin’ Bell 209 assault
choppers up the ass, we’re losing one out of every nine loads. It’s no
duckwalk for us anymore, y’know. Forget it.</p>

<p><strong>omar</strong>: Look Mr. Sosa, we’re getting ahead of
ourselves here. I’m down on Frank’s authority to buy 200 keys, that’s
it, that’s my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on
anything larger than that. So why don’t we…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey Omar why don’t you let the man finish,
hunh? Let him propose his proposition.</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay !
I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UQ!</p>

now. I have a jet there that’11 have you in Miami in five hours. You can
be back here tomorrow. For lunch.</p>

mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organi-
zation…hunh? You tell me Tony.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey Frank’s smart. Don’t blame him for that
animal. It’s crazy business we’re in, it can happen to anybody – even
you y’know. I’ll talk to Frank myself. I’ll fix this thing up right
between you. You got my word on that.</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: You speak with your eyes muchacho. I think –

<p><strong>continued 113</strong>: 113</p>
<p><strong>114 ext. the babylon club - night 114</strong>: Tony runs
out, crouched, to his red Jaguar. Exchanging shots with a third hitter
across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition. He jumps into the
Jaguar, his windows being blown out. The second hitter, wounded, running
out of the club, towards him. The third hitter advancing, carhops
scattering. Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram
machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire. Carhops
scattering, the hitters seeking cover. Hitter two, already wounded, is
hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.</p>
<p><strong>114 continued 114</strong>: Tony now pops a button.
Bulletproof blackout shutters whap across the shattered windows. He guns
the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off the armor plating,
whining against the shutters. Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches
down and slams the gear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile
in reverse, climbing to top speed…. As hitter three realizes it’s too
late, tries to get out of there, but is overtaken and crushed by the
car.</p>
<p><strong>115 house - that night 115</strong>: Tow, aching from his
wound, is attended by a Doctor, who reveals to Us an ugly wound on his
rib cage. Tony looks at it, doesn’t express a reaction.</p>

<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, don’t worry Tony. I got it.</p>

<p><strong>159 ext. warehouse - alongside miami freeway - day</strong>:
Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the glary sunlight.
From the continual sound of jet aircraft taking off and landing we might
sense we’re near an airport. As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back,
Tony, carrying a suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the
warehouse:</p>
<p><strong>160 int. seidelbaum office - warehouse - day 16</strong>: The
office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black. There’s noise
from an outer office, and people on phones, moving, talking. Tony and
Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills from the duffel bag and
suitcase onto a coffee table. Two men in casual sports clothing sit
opposite them in chairs, one of them – Seidelbaum – squaring the bills
and passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine which
clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene. Seidelbaum’s a small,
fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of rings on his fingers and sharp, porky
eyes. The other guy – Luis – a dark Cuban, is long, lean and smooth with
aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks coffee, smiles a lot and
bullshits – two sordid guys who look the part. It’s a tedious process
counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and
throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick
never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the
amounts. the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although
they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: . I . yeah back then I worked in pictures down
in Columbia. Burn, y’ever see it?.. with Marlon Brando. We’re good
friend. I was his driver….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Yeah, in Caragena, they shot it there Italian
guy.</p>

machine don’t make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, we’ll count it again.</p>
<p><strong>siedelbaum</strong>: Oh Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey business is business. We’re talking

<p><strong>seidelbaum</strong>: Okay, you keep the change okay, I don’t

<p><strong>161 int. seidelbaum’s warehouse office - day 161</strong>:
They’re drinking another round of coffee, exhausted, smoke filling the
room. The table now resembles a Mount Everest of green and they’re still
counting. The money, like discarded food, is spread all over the place –
in boxes, brown paper bags, on the couch. They stretch, rub their
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>seidelbaum</strong>: We’re up to what?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Seven checks. A million three hundred
twenty-five and six hundred twenty-three …plus eighteen cents.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey we’re almost finished. Another 200
thousand and we can take a leak.</p>
<p><strong>siedelbaum</strong>: Yeah but this’11 do fine.</p>

for a continuing criminal conspiracy. The Rico Statute. Get ’em up.</p>

is not that clear an image as he glances briefly, uninterested, into the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yeah, is that what you jerk off in front of
Seidelbaum?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh shit and I was supposed to meet this chick
at three. What a pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>seidelbaum</strong>: Okay, Danny, turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>seidelbaum</strong>: All right, Montana, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything you say can be taken against you. You have
the….</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I know all that shit, Seidelbaum, save your
breath. It ain’t gonna stick. You know it, I know it. I ’.m here
changing dollar bills is all. So you wanna waste everybody’s time here,
I call my lawyer. Best lawyer in Miami. He’s so good tomorrow morning
you’re gonna be working in Alaska, Seidelbaum….</p>

two years, you won’t start doing time till ’85.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: they never get me back in a</p>
<p><strong>sheffield</strong>: Tony.. .the law has to prove ‘beyond a
reasonable doubt.’ I’m an expert at raising that doubt but when you got
a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera,
honeybaby, it’s hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: All right-.-all right. I do the three fuckin’
years but lemme tell you about my law, George. It’s real simple. There’s
no ‘reasonable doubt.’ If you’re rain-making the judge or you fuck me
for the four hundred grand and I come in guilty on the big rap – you,
the judge, the prosecutor, nothing’s gonna stop me, y’hear? your fuckin’
eyeballs out.</p>

<p><strong>matos study</strong>: A “Phil Donahue-type” setting. A
segment now in progress with the “Donahue-type” interviewing Dr. Orlando
Gutierrez. Gutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and
polished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of enormous
passion.</p>
<p><strong>gutierrez</strong>: than 10,OOO’of our people are</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: I’ve heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez,
about the financial support your govern- ment receives from the drug
industry in Bolivia.</p>
<p><strong>gutierfsz</strong>: The irony, of course, is that this money
– which is in the billions, J i m - - is coming from your country. You
are the major purchaser of our national product – which of course is
cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: So what you’re saying Doctor Gutierrez
is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is
doing business with the very same government that floods those’ streets
with cocaine.. -that’s a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>gutierrbz</strong>: Let me show you some of the other
characters in the comedy, Jim…my organization just recently traced a
purchase by this man —</p>
<p><strong>gutxerrez</strong>: . . . here he is, the charming face
belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two
months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in
Switzerland. to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what’s he doing living
in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?</p>

<p><strong>170 gutierrez 170</strong>: holds up another photograph –

this, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>171 tony 171</strong>: staring intently at him, reluctantly
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: …he’s scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He’s
going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People
everywhere are starting to listen to him. He’s embarrassing, Tony…Thats

<p><strong>sosa</strong>: Alberto, you know Tony Montana – my partner
from Florida.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 171 171</p>
<p><strong>sosa</strong>: So you see Albert0 here is going to help fix
our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business –

English, and he needs a little help… Is that a problem, Tony?</p>

Manny? Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what? You’re fifty and
you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on ‘em and your liver’s got
spots and you’re looking like these rich fuckin’ mummies in here? Is

yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do?
Deal drugs? Kill people? Oh that’s just wonderful Tony – a real
contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do
you think you’d make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell
the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to
school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you’re still going to be
alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You’re dreaming, Tony, you’re
dreaming!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Sit down before I kill you.</p>
<p><strong>elvxra</strong>: . . You think of yourself as a husband, too,
Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons around

<p><strong>tony</strong>: You need people like me so you can point your
fingers and say ‘hey there’s the bad guy!’ So what does that make you?
Good guys? Don’t kid yourselves. You’re no better’n me. You just know
