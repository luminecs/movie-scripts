<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s a slow leak.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What’s slow?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe twenty gallons an hour.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Where from?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under
the waterline. I don’t think it’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Hear that, Dodge? Epps don’t think it’s a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’ll sleep good tonight knowing that.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Greer to Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: The number nine on the starboard side’s half
flooded. Epps says it’s a slow leak just under the waterline, about
twenty gallons an hour. They must’ve pumped it before we left Sitka.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Of course they did.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Let the buyer beware.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What do you say, Dodge?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: If it started out at twenty an hour the piece
of shit’d be at the bottom of the Gulf by now. Whether it’ll make
St. Lawrence is anybody’s guess.</p>
<p><strong>vasili</strong>: I thought you say Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Better late than never.</p>
<p><strong>vasili</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You got a leak in the number nine
compartment.</p>
<p><strong>vasili</strong>: No, no. You got leak.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she’ll
be good as new.</p>
<p><strong>vasili</strong>: That cost me twenty grand at least.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Fifteen, at the most.</p>
<p><strong>vasili</strong>: Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we
see. After my guy looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>vasili</strong>: You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey
D. Otherwise, please to sign.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to
Russia.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He’ll sell the scrap for three times what he
paid.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I must be in the wrong business.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Better than “making hamburger for Mickey
D.”</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Much obliged, skipper.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Looks like Epps’ gonna get some tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: With that coxswain dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You aren’t jealous, are you Dodge?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a
break.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I’ll show you, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: You want to mess with me, I’ll kick your
bitch ass, girl.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about. I just
bought this guy a beer.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: This “guy” is my man, honey.</p>
<p><strong>coastguardsman</strong>: Darlene –</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: You, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Listen, I don’t want any trouble, okay – ?</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: Uh-uh. No. We’re gonna fix this right
now.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What seems to be the trouble, ladies?</p>
<p><strong>riveter</strong>: Whyn’t you mind your own business,
chief.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: As I said, what seems to be the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>riveter</strong>: Didn’t you hear me, grandpa? Or you got
your hearing aid turned down?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I heard you. But I’m choosing to ignore you.
Epps, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>riveter</strong>: These ladies was having themselves a
discussion and you’re interrupting it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You got about two seconds to get your paws
off me, Tarzan.</p>
<p><strong>riveter</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Epps?</p>
<p><strong>coastguardsman</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>coastguardsman</strong>: Darlene. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguardsman</strong>: I don’t love you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>coastguardsman</strong>: Come on, Candy. Let’s get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Morning everybody.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night,
did you Epps?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I bet you did.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Candy?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s my pen name.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Red sky at night, sailor’s delight.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: One more?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Why not.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What is your first name?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It just occurred to me I don’t know your
first name. All this time and I don’t know it.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maureen.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maureen.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Maureen?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Roger?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You think that’s funny</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Greer to Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: There’s a large vessel out about ten miles to
the north-west.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I been watching it for close to an hour and
it hasn’t moved. I can’t raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it
might be in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Alright. I’ll be right up.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Merchant vessel at position one seven four
one five west, five seven seven five north.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha
sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Merchant vessel at one seven four one five
west, five seven seven five north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Too deep to anchor out there.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Looks like it’s adrift.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Could be a fishing boat.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Too big. More like a freighter.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What the hell would a freighter be doing up
here? It’s way out of the lanes. There’s not a port for 800 miles.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Smugglers maybe.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Smuggling what? Tundra grass?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Merchant vessel at position one seven four
one five west, five seven seven five north, this is tugboat Arctic
Warrior. Do you copy? Over.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Call the Coastguard?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Steer to one eight five. Let’s check her
out.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Alright. Back it off.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hit the lights.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Whoa, whoa.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: “Chimera.”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior. Is
there anyone aboard?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Chimera, I am hove to at your port bow. Is
there anyone aboard?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Epps, come with me. You guys sit tight.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Talk to me, skipper.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’re in a stairwell just under the main
superstructure.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is definitely an old boat, maybe sixty
years old. She hasn’t been in service for at least twenty years.
Probably a lot longer.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Besides a little rust, everything’s pretty
well-preserved.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How she got out here is one hell of a good
question. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Murphy, goddamit.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s a passenger ship. It’s a damn passenger
ship.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: There’s nobody on that boat.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up
in a current.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot
passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump
into her until now?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Somebody’s probably looking for her as we
speak.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Whatever the reason, she’s adrift and
abandoned. We’ve got every right to salvage her.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: You mean tow her back? That’s a thirty
thousand ton ship you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’ve done it before.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the
other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag
her over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You have any idea how much a ship like that
could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few
million.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: If you get it back in one piece.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s a risk I’m willing to take.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: All we got to do is hit some rough weather
and you can forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: So we cut her loose and wait it out. A
little weather couldn’t be anything she hasn’t seen before.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It’s a bloody navigation hazard. One boat
can’t control a ship that size.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The damn thing’s been floating around for
God knows how long and it hasn’t hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A
little of the old push pull.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Listen. Forget this job’s just a pay check
for a minute. You know I’ve been good to you. But I’m prepared to offer
you something better now. If we do this right, it’s worth a lot of
money. A lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Salvage fees on a vessel like this could
come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more.
Could be a lot more. What I’m proposing is… we split it four ways.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Think about it. A million bucks a piece. You
want to spend the rest of your days drag-assing tank barges on the gulf
coast, fine. Otherwise, let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: United States Coastguard, United States
Coastguard, United States Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic Warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North
Island. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: North Island, I wish to declare myself
salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International
Maritime Convention.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Affirmative, Arctic Warrior.
What type of vessel?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: A passenger liner. Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Say again. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: A passenger liner, north island. Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: What is the vessel name,
registry, and present position? Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Passenger vessel “Chimera.” I will spell:
charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is
available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that
the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven
four west, five seven north at… Two zero one four hours zulu time.
Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Affirmative, Arctic Warrior.
Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and
out.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Okay. We’re gonna use a heavier than usual
twin cable rig this time, consisting of a pair of number three gauge
braided wire tows. We’ll tie off through the anchor alleys. And come
down to the aft port and starboard pins. Here. Thus, we need to get two
of these… Up there.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Seeing as though a foot of one of these
fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain’t gonna be what you’d call
easy. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Supposing one of those cables breaks under
tow.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Then we’ll all be doomed. Any other
questions?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Bring it on, dude.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Hit it!</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Dodge? You alright?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Alright, skipper, real easy.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Steady as she goes.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Throttle back.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Right there, skipper. Right there.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I figure we go through at the Unimak Pass
here. Refuel at Sanak Island.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: With a little extra fuel, weather
permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this
boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: They shoulda thought of that when they let
her float away.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I don’t care what, ain’t nobody just gonna
let us walk away with a ship that size.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The law’s on our side. If they want to
challenge it, let them try.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: They must’ve scuttled it. Nobody just lets a
ship float away.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner
either.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Ever heard of insurance, big boy?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Either way, we found it. It’s ours now –
.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Mother fucker!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Threw a turbine blade.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The number one turbine’s pretty well trashed.
Number two runs, but it’s way underpowered.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How long to fix?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a
look. At least a couple days. Depending.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: You think the extra strain caused it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Nah. Everything was cool. It’s just one of
those things.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Some classy tub in it’s day, huh?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Everything’s still here. Ticket records,
receipts, books of account.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: One first class passage. Elizabeth James.
Dubayy to Halifax. January 29th 1953.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Chimera. Flag ship of the Dobbins Kirk Line.
Nova Scotia.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: scattered charts and I’d sure like to get my
hands on the general log.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: That must be the old man right there.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: He’d let you off at the nearest port, that’s
for sure.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: How about now?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Sixty pounds.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What? You sure?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: That’s what it says.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Lemme see.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What’d you find up there?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Some charts. A crew manifest. Looks like her
last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell’s she been
since.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: She was sailing up north, right?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Her destination was Halifax, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Well, suppose she got a little further north
than she should have. Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew
evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where
it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole
global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats
around til somebody runs into her.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: As reasonable an explanation as any, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out
of New York in 1872. One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal
by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got
closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste.
On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife,
their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their
log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner.
And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without
anyone aboard.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: So what did happen?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Nobody knows. There’ve been a lot of
theories, of course. But we’ll never really know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: You think she’s sailing without a crew?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I think we’d be surprised where a drifting
ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: You’re more practical than superstitious.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Only way to be.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Turbine rotor’s shot.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I thought you said it was just a blade.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Metal’s crystallized. Gotta replace the whole
deal.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How much longer’s that gonna take?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Like I always say –</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I know I know, two ways to do anything –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The right way and the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: But how long?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows
up and we’re history.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’m telling you, you don’t want to be running
that fan like it is.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What about running number two by itself?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It’s a full 2500 horses down. We couldn’t
drag that boat down hill on ice with it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How long, then?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I gotta pull the blades and re-seat
everything in a new rotor – .</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Three, four days.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Goddamit, Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What do you want me to tell you, that we can
throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened?
Can’t do it, skipper.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard. Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North
Island. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: North Island, North Island, North Island.
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior. Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Arctic Warrior, we have
submitted your section four two charlie salvage notification. However,
the International Maritime Authority record for a passenger vessel
Chimera indicates it was lost at sea in the Gulf of Oman day two month
two year one nine five three. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: North Island, please repeat? Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Arctic Warrior, passenger
vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five
three. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: North Island, have you got any additional
information? Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Affirmative, Arctic Warrior.
The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.
Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three
two. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Roger, North Island. I am tied to the
passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat.
Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say
again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at
sea. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Roger, North Island. Please advise pending
further information. Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Affirmative, Arctic Warrior.
This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and
out.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Obviously it’s some kind of screw up. The
shipping records aren’t a hundred percent accurate.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no
business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and
hit the highway.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Are you crazy? Do you realize we got
ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, a ship that’s supposed to have been
lost at sea fifty years ago. You don’t think that’s just a little
freaky?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody
thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, well how the hell you get something
like that wrong? That’s a damn big boat. It’s either sunk or it
ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We all want to get outa here, Dodge.
Especially me. With that boat in tow. You got three days. Make the most
of it.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Fucker!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Take it easy, Dodge. It’s only a piece of
metal.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Damn mind of it’s own.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Morning, skipper.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: You’re up late.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Guess I must’ve fallen back to sleep.
Where’s Epps?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Went aboard.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: She take a radio?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What the fuck we gonna do with it?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What the fuck you think we gonna do with it?
It’s ours, baby. It’s all ours.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: How much you figure that’s worth,
skipper?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Ho, baby!</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: That’s a lot of money for somebody to just let
float away.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s a hell of a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What, you think there’s something funny about
it?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: A ship with fifty million dollars in gold
aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for
it?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: If they thought it was lost at sea, they
probably just wrote it off.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe.
But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe they didn’t want it back. Maybe the
whole fat deal was insured.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Maybe. But there’s always somebody whose
interest’s at stake.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: All I gotta say is it looks like that
somebody’s us right now.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: And it looks like somebody got here before us
too.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Didn’t happen yesterday, I’ll tell you that.
Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Then it happened before they scuttled
her.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: You mean, before she sank.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Cargo like this could make a crew think
twice.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That it could.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Then why didn’t they take it.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Probably didn’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Or somebody stopped them.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Either way, they must’ve had a pretty good
reason.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Must be a damn good reason to jump ship and
leave fifty million dollars aboard.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: So what’re we gonna do. That’s the big
question, right?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: A salvage claim to a vessel’s cargo’s as
valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Then we’re rich. We’re damn, filthy stinking
rich.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It looks like it.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a
move on?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We leave it where it is. Stick to the
plan.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need
that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: So we get a little more for the boat.
Besides, the gold’ll be safer where it is.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece
of shit all the way back to Sitka.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s worth the effort. Believe me. Besides
we’re gonna need her to prove the salvage.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Why not call for help?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: For now the best thing we can do is to keep
quiet about this.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Last thing we want is extra partners.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Or uninvited guests.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The sooner we get under way, the sooner we
are to spending what’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one. Two
twenty two.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid
gold.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: That’s what I call a payday.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Hell yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Murphy!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Propane tanks’re gonna go!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: One minute I’m minding my own business, the
next thing I know the whole place is burning up. An oxygen tank must’ve
blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Looks like it took out the backup genny
too.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How’s that leg?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Seen better – Ow!</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: This’s gonna hurt a little.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Thanks for the warning – Ow! Damn!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We could call for help.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: And get a bunch of fools sniffin’ around
here?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What other choices have we got?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I tell you one thing, we’re not gonna be
towing no ship now.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: United States Coastguard, this is tugboat
Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Radio
check. Over.</p>
<p><strong>coastguard dispatcher</strong>: Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North
Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Fifty million four ways. That’s twelve
million and change a piece. What you gonna do with your share,
skipper?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out
my golden years and all that.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’m buyin’ me a nice outrigger. Spend my time
hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How about you Epps?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Guess I’ll just keep working.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What’re you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I like my job.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Greer?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Moving to Sweden.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What’s so great about Sweden?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: It’s a beautiful country. Very clean. Very
civilized. And cold.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: That’s a good thing?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the
better.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls
you only gonna dream about.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: We’ll see who’s dreamin’, m’man.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dreamin’s all any of you’re gonna be doing
if we don’t get this boat running.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s coming from inside.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Sounds like the hull.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Warm water current maybe, making the metal
expand.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: That shit is seriously bizarre.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Take it easy, you’ll live longer.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: The guy. He just came this way.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What guy?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: There’s somebody else on this boat.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What? What the hell’re you talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Of course I’m sure. I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You sure it wasn’t me?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It wasn’t you. It was somebody else. There’s
somebody else aboard.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Light in those passages ain’t so good.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I’m telling you, I saw somebody. I don’t know
who it was. But I saw somebody.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What’d he look like?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn’t get a good
look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you’re
standing there.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Where’s his boat, then? Where’s his crew? He
ain’t gonna be out here by himself, that’s for damn sure.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: She’s so big somebody could come alongside
her on the other side and we’d never know it.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe that is his boat.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Gimme a break.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If somebody’s aboard her already, she ain’t
ours. She’s theirs.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Bullshit. That boat hasn’t made steam for
fifty years. We found her. She’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Not in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: So, we find this guy and make a deal with
him.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We don’t exactly have the best bargaining
position.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I say fuck the motherfucker. We’re a
professional salvage crew going about our business. What’s some yahoo
doing way out here by himself anyway?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: And what do you propose? That we knock this
guy off?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Why not? Why the fuck not?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We
gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: So we kill him?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’m saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do
to preserve our interest.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let’s just take it easy here, alright?
Nobody’s gonna kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Supposing he wants to get bad with us?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: One guy isn’t gonna be so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe he isn’t alone.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I say we off-load some of that gold now.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Would you hold on just a minute here,
please? Look, there’s no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine.
It’s a big boat. Chances’re real good he doesn’t even know about the
gold. If we stay cool, nobody’ll be the wiser. The gold stays where it
is til we’re ready to go. Like I said, it’ll be a hell of a lot safer
there than here.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What if that fucker finds it before we’re
ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’ll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low
man first.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Guess that’d be me. Again.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dodge, get on that turbine. I don’t care if
you don’t sleep for a week. The sooner you’re done, the sooner we can
get out of here. How’s the food situation?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Pretty low all around.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’ll have to take it easy then. I don’t
think we’ll find much aboard the ship, but it’s probably worth looking
around.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Say we run into this guy again.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If he’s reasonable, maybe we can make some
kind of deal. If not. We’ll have to re-consider our options.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You
raised on a farm?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Seen a lota movies.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No cowboy shit up there, understand?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: No cowboy shit. Right.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Coffee.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: You’re a pal.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Got your light?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Smokes?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: See you boys later. Don’t be late, I need my
beauty rest.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy to Epps.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy to Epps.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Epps.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You just shoot at something?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Ho-ly shit.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Couldn’t have happened much more than a
month ago.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Bodies’re too fresh.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Fresh ain’t the first word that comes to
mind.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Greek citizen. Merchant navy. Obviously we
aren’t the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across
it just like we did.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: And look what happened.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Damn barbaric is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Could be meant as a warning.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Stay away. Or else.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Because of the gold.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That’d be my guess.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: So whoever did this might still be
around.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Maybe Epps’s mystery man had something to do
with it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: So, what? We report this? Call the
Coastguard?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Let’s not be too hasty.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if
we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard,
FBI, who knows who, all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dodge, if this isn’t incentive enough to fix
that boat, I don’t know what is.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: All the seals and gaskets’re shot. Anything
that was rubber burned up.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Can’t you use something else?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I might be able to find something on the
ship. But it’s gonna take time.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I need lag bolts, especially one inch
standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an
inch. Aluminium, even tin’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I ain’t no mechanic, just so you know.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You find anything that even looks like a
compressor. I don’t care what, grab it.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Dodge?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Dodge!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Captain relieved of command.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is Murphy. Anybody trying to call me?
Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Greer? Dodge?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “Cock-a-doodle-doo,” said the rooster to the
crow. “Where are you now? I know, but won’t say so.”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Who is this!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny
whistle toy. Penny whistle toy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Greer! Dodge!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Dodge to Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You better get down here quick, skipper. I’m
on “C” deck. Cabin 400.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I think you better see this for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I found him like this.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska
getofedobrodijotosiantosg.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I’m no doctor. But I’d say he’s in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I don’t know what else you’d call it. He’s
breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He’s
totally unresponsive to pain. What happened up there?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I heard a scream. When I got there I found
him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn’t see
anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He must’ve seen something.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Other than the obvious, there’s nothing wrong
with him that I can see, not on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Then what the hell happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Just before I heard him yell there was
somebody on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Greer?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I don’t know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It was a man’s voice. Repeating some sort of
children’s rhyme. I don’t know, it didn’t make any sense. You didn’t
hear it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: He needs a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’ll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal
flares you can scrounge up. Keep an eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: United States Coastguard, United States
Coastguard, United States Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic Warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: United States Coastguard, United States
Coastguard, United States Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic Warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. This
is Arctic Warrior. Arctic Warrior. Arctic Warrior. Whiskey alpha sierra
bravo four zero niner two. Last known position one seven four west, five
seven north. I am afloat and drifting. Require immediate medical
assistance for one person, possibly comatose. I am a one hundred twenty
foot civilian tug, hove to at port bow of disabled passenger liner
Chimera. I repeat, Chimera. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Same. Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No. I’ll try again later.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: They’re dead in the water that morning. Four
hours later the captain’s relieved of his command. And that evening they
issue a general</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of
being lost at sea. I don’t think mutiny’s out of the question here.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: On a passenger ship in 1953?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If they knew what they were carrying.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: You’re saying they mutinied for the gold?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If they were close enough to shore, they
probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Only something must’ve gone wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, way wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: So. I got a question. Just from a, you know,
purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard. Coastguard shows
up. What exactly is the plan?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Well, they’re gonna be asking a lot of
questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we
oughta be prepared is all.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I guess the best strategy’s just to tell
them the truth.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When
there’s more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that’s a whole
new deal.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What do you propose?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: For starters, getting that gold off the ship.
What they don’t know about isn’t gonna bother them.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: There’s no way we’re gonna hide a few
thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it’ll be
safer where it is.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: With all due respect, skipper. Part of that
up there’s mine. I’d kinda like to have a little say in what happens to
it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get back to
shore, you can do whatever you want with your share. But until then, the
gold stays right where it is.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Just what the hell do you think you’re
doing?!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I think you know.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Maybe you can tell me then.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The radio!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Take it easy, willya? What about the
radio?!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You smashed it!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Don’t lie to me!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What the fuck – ?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You didn’t want us calling anybody. Too
liable to ruin your big payday.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I didn’t touch the fucking radio.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I didn’t touch the fucking radio! Ever occur
to you there’s somebody else on that boat, skipper?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Conveniently enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Look, I didn’t touch it. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s Greer.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Never been more thirsty in my life.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Drink up then.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How’re you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Lost my sea legs.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Any dizziness?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Headache, nausea, lights?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Lights?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Sudden flashes of light.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I feel fine.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What day is it?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I don’t know. Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Wrong. It’s Friday.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Try Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Right. Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You don’t remember?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Last thing I remember I was aboard the
Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You’ve been out for about a day.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Say what?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dodge found you out cold in one of the
cabins.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We heard you scream. Any idea what you
might’ve seen?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I wish I could tell you. I’d be real
interested to know myself.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The ah… the radio’s out.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Somebody took it out of commission last
night.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Smashed it up pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: But, who – ?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The skipper seems to think I did it. That I’m
more interested in that gold than my own safety or the safety of my
fellow shipmates.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Hell no. You think I’m crazy?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Regardless of how it happened, there isn’t
much of a chance to fix it. The odds of another vessel in range of the
walkie-talkies are almost astronomical. So, as of today, we’re pretty
much on our own out here.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Looks like part of the general log.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: “The crew have gone mad with greed and fight
among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill.”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: February first.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: The same day she supposedly went down.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Must not’ve been the captain’s entry. He was
probably out of the picture by then.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: “Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly
caused the collision. Distress calls have been made.”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Collision? With what?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: The page’s missing. Then their SOS was
real.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: But where’s the damage?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If it was a ship she hit.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Dodge to Murphy!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You better get down here right now! We’re
taking water! Big time!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What the hell happened!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Turbine chamber on number two must’ve blown!
Took out part of the hull!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: We’re not gonna be able to pump it!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This’ is
where we get off!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dodge!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That just about says it all.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Rotten stem to stern. Guess you couldn’t
expect much else.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: We ain’t exactly in what you’d call your high
traffic neighborhood either.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The coast guard has our last position.
They’ll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can’t
exactly miss.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s a good bet they’ll be asking a lot of
questions when they get here too.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let ’em ask. This ship’s legally ours
now.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: When they find out what it’s carrying, they
may not be so interested in what’s legal.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you
scuttled our boat.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The turbine blew.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Lemme see, was that before or after the oil
fire?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Easy, easy.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Gettin’ a little hot under the collar, I’d
say.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I said, shut the hell up.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Both of you. I don’t want to hear it
again.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: So just stow it. You understand? We don’t
need this right now.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You shouldn’t be down here alone.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Just wanted to check on our little baby.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he
wants.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If money can buy what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I don’t figure there’s much I want money
can’t buy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Then you’re a lucky man.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’ll stand the watch on deck tonight.
You’re up first.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You must leave.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: There’s great evil here, more than you can
know. Leave now or you may never leave.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: My God….</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, fine.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You’d think on a ship this size there’d be
something left to eat.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: After fifty years there ain’t nothin’ left
but shoe leather.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Tomorrow we’ll see if we can’t find some
line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: There’s a charming thought.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: We can always start shooting birds.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What say, Epps? You up for some roasted
albatross?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Looks like we’re in a strong current. Must be
making almost five knots full on ass backwards.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Nasty little swell outa the north west
too.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let’s just hope somebody sees us first out
here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s a Noaa buoy.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Government weather. It’s got a transmitter
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Higher. You’re gonna miss it.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: We’re still drifting.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The mooring hasn’t come taught.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s not gonna hold us.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: No fucking way.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Wish I could say the same.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What do you think happened on this boat?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I guess that’s the sixty four thousand
dollar question, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Never mind. Before your time. I think at
least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens
when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia,
usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody’s
guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn’t look
like the last time.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Are we smart enough to avoid that?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I don’t know, are we?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I’d
seen… something. Someone.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Not our mystery guest again.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: No. Someone else. A girl. I’m not sure she
was… real.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Not real?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What, like some kind of ghost?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I don’t know what else you’d call her. One
second she was there, the next she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: And I had a kind of hallucination. There were
others. I saw them in the pool. Drowning.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was
more than that. As though they were showing me.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Showing you what?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What happened.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Maybe it was one of them did the handy work
on those Greeks.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: No. I think they are, were, just passengers.
Innocent victims.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Victims of what?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Something bad happened here, Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That much I think we’ve already
established.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: More than just a mutiny. More than just the
gold.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: She said the ship was evil. That we had to
leave right away. That if we didn’t, we might never leave.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Why you? How come the rest of us haven’t
seen these people?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Just lucky I guess.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well. Getting off this ship’s exactly what
we’re trying to do. Short of that, I don’t know what else to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Do me a favor and wake up Dodge. He’s next
on.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: And Epps?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You can tell the others about this. But, for
my money, I think it’s best you keep it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Dodge. Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Don’t fall asleep.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: This is Dodge. Over.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “Cock-a-doodle-doo,” said the rooster to the
crow. “Where are you now? I know but won’t say so.”</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Identify yourself, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy – .</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dodge?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I don’t even want to know what that’s gonna
taste like now.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Better than starving to death.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy to Epps.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Epps, over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Either of you seen Dodge?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He’s not on deck and I can’t raise him on
the radio.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He took the shotgun and a light.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Must’ve heard something below deck and went
down to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Alright. We stay together. Nobody goes any
further than earshot.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge. Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Epps? You there?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Greer?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Sorry. Didn’t mean to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something
is all.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Nothing. Let’s get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Can’t find the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: So whoever did this now has our shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Doesn’t look like it much matters.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What do we do with him?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Leave him till we can get some help. From
now on, nobody comes down here.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: What about the gold?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Leave it.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Now hold up just a minute. Let’s be
reasonable here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You think whoever did this is
reasonable?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: All I’m saying is that gold’s worth a lot
more to us now than it ever was.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I can’t believe you. Dodge’s dead and all you
can think about is cashing in your share.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I didn’t sign up to go home empty handed. And
I sure ain’t gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Nobody’s going anywhere with that gold now.
Anybody tries to board, we’ll know about it. You can do what you want,
Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it
comes to that.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Greer?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Greer!</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska
getofedobrodijotosiantosg.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy! I’m on C deck, cabin 400! Get down
here now!!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Must’ve been him all along.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. Killed
Dodge. Would’ve killed you. He’s off his nut, no doubt there.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Could be a stroke. Who knows? The general log
said the crew were fighting among themselves. “Like wild dogs.”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Over the gold.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Maybe it was more than that.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: They went crazy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like
him.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We lash a few of these together it might get
us far enough into the shipping lanes to be rescued.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hard to say which is worse, staying here or
taking our chances in open water.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: If the weather holds it might not be so
bad.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s not the weather I’m worried about. The
wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come
across another boat.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the
crow. Where are you now? I know but won’t say so.”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny
whistle toy. Penny whistle toy.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: “Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the
crow. Where are you now? I know but won’t say so.”</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: “Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the
crow. Where are you now? I know but won’t say so.” Cassandra, if you
insist on playing that while I read I’ll just stop right now.</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He certainly did shorten it, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I thought this was all the rage.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Maybe last year.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What about this year?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It’s not your color anyway.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I like it, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Well thank you!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Daddy, how much longer before we start moving
again?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: They’re working on the engines, honey. As
soon as they fix them we’ll be on our way.</p>
<p><strong>mutineer</strong>: You like that, daddy? I’ll show you
something else now.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Many bad things have happened here. But you
mustn’t allow the evil inside. I tell you this because you can see me.
The others can’t. But you must leave. You must leave.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Epps to Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Epps to Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We hit land.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’re in an island chain. It’s only a matter
of time before we hit another one.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Greer’s gone. He broke out of the tank.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: He’s been shot.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let’s get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It should be enough to get us to one of
those islands. Gimme a hand, wouldya?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Prop it here. We need to pull these braces
off. There’s a hammer on the stand. There.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It was you.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: You killed them.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It was only a matter of time before somebody
killed somebody. You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his
plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went
nuts. Couldn’t take it, I guess. Could’ve happened in the middle of
downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don’t
think so.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: So you killed them?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The way I figure it, it was them or me. I
thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little
time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around.
But it’s just us on this ship. Us and your… spirit friends.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: And now you’re gonna kill me, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I didn’t want it to turn out this way.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: Murphy, don’t you see what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I think I see it pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s the ship. The ship’s making you think
this way.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I know a little bit about human nature and
what I’ve seen only confirms that.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: It’s a trap. There was no way we were gonna
get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It’s just the bait. This ship
sucks people in and it never lets them out.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I think maybe you been on this boat a little
too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There’s nothing
supernatural about greed. And that’s what it comes down to, pure and
simple.</p>
<p><strong>epps</strong>: I don’t give a damn about the gold.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I wish I could believe that. Either way, you
know what I’ve done. I’ve got no choice.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: There’s no reason to make this any more
difficult than it has to be.</p>
