<h1 id="forrest-gump">forrest-gump</h1>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hello. My name’s Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You want a chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I could eat about a million and a half of
these. My momma always said, “Life was like a box of chocolates. You
never know what you’re gonna get.”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Those must be comfortable shoes. I’ll bet
you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I
had shoes like that.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: My feet hurt.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma always says there’s an awful lot you
could tell about a person by their shoes. Where they’re going. Where
they’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’ve worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think
about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma said they’d take my anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She said they was my magic shoes.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes
now. Let’s take a little walk around.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How do those feel? His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump. As strong as I’ve ever seen. But his back is as crooked as a
politician.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: But we’re gonna straighten him right up now,
won’t we, Forrest?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, when I was a baby, Momma named me
after the great Civil War hero, General Nathan Bedford Forrest…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She said we was related to him in some way.
And, what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.
They’d all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a
bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. They’d even put bedsheets on
their horses and ride around. And anyway, that’s how I got my name.
Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma said that the Forrest part was to
remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don’t make no
sense.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Just wait, let me get it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Let me get it. Wait, get it this way.
Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Oooh. All right. What are you all staring
at? Haven’t you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs
before?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Don’t ever let anybody tell you they’re
better than you, Forrest. If God intended everybody to be the same, he’d
have given us all braces on our legs.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: We lived about a quarter mile of Route 17,
about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That’s in the
county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Momma’s family since her
grandpa’s grandpa’s grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand
years ago. Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Since it was just me and Momma and we had
all these empty rooms, Momma decided to let those rooms out. Mostly to
people passing through. Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like
that. That’s how me and Mommy got money. Mommy was a real smart
lady.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Remember what I told you, Forrest. You’re
no different than anybody else is.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You’re
the same as everybody else. You are no different.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Your boy’s… different, Mrs. Gump. Now,
his I.Q. is seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Well, we’re all different,
Mr. Hancock.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She wanted me to have the finest education,
so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School. I met the
principal and all.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.
Now, this is normal.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Forrest is right here. The state requires
a minimum I.Q. of eighty to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He’s gonna
have to go to a special school. Now, he’ll be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: What does normal mean, anyway? He might
be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else. He’s not going to some special school to
learn to how to re-tread tires. We’re talking about five little points
here. There must be something can be done.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: We’re a progressive school system. We
don’t want to see anybody left behind.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: He’s on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Well, your momma sure does care about
your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: You don’t say much, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Finally, he had to try it. It looked
easy, but, oh, what happened. First there…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma, what’s vacation mean?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Vacation?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Where Daddy went?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Vacation’s when you go somewhere, and you
don’t ever come back.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma
was on our own.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But we didn’t mind. Our house was never
empty. There was always folks comin’ and goin’.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Suppa.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: It’s suppa, everyone. Forrest…</p>
<p><strong>man with cane</strong>: My, my. That sure looks special.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Gentlemen, would you care to join us for
supper? Hurry up and get it before the flies do. I prefer you don’t
smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sometimes we had so many people stayin’
with us that every room was filled with travelers. You know, folks
livin’ out of their suitcases, and hat cases, and sample cases.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Well, you go ahead and start. I can’t
find Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Forrest… Forrest…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: One time a young man was staying with us,
and he had him a guitar case.</p>
<p><strong>elvis presley</strong>: “Well, you ain’t never caught a
rabbit, and you ain’t no friend of mine.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Forrest! I told you not to bother this
nice young man.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Oh, no, that’s all right, ma’am. I was just
showin’ him a thing or two on the guitar here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: All right, but your supper’s ready if
y’all want to eat.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you
just did there. Slow it down some.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: “You ain’t nothin’ but a hound, hound
dog…”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I liked that guitar.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It sounded good.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: “…cryin’ all the time”</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: “You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog…”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I started moving around to the music,
swinging my hips. This one night me and Momma…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …was out shoppin’, and we walked right by
Benson’s Furniture and Appliance store, and guess what.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog…</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: This is not children’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: “Well, you ain’t never caught a rabbit and
you ain’t no friend of mine.”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Some years later, that handsome young man
who they called “The King,” well, he sung too many songs, had himself a
heart attack or something.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Must be hard being a king. You know, it’s
funny how you remember some things, but some things you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: You do your very best now, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I sure will, Momma.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I remember the bus ride on the first day of
school very well.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: Are you comin’ along?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma said not to be taking rides from
strangers.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: This is the bus to school.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: I’m Dorothy Harris.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well, now we ain’t strangers anymore.</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: This seat’s taken.</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: It’s taken!</p>
<p><strong>boy #3</strong>: You can’t sit here.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You know, it’s funny what a young man
recollects. ’Cause I don’t remember being born.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I, I… don’t recall what I got for my first
Christmas and I don’t know when I went on my first outdoor picnic. But,
I do remember the first time I heard the sweetiest voice…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …in the wide world.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You can sit here if you want.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I had never seen anything so beautiful in
my life. She was like an angel.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren’t
ya?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s wrong with your legs?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Um, nothing at all, thank you. My legs are
just fine and dandy.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I just sat next to her on that bus and had
conversation all the way to school.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Then why do you have those shoes on?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: My momma said my back’s crooked like a
question mark. These are going to make me as straight as an arrow.
They’re my magic shoes.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And next to Momma, no one ever talked to me
or asked me questions.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you stupid or something.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: From that day on, we was always together.
Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She taught me how to climb…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on, Forrest, you can do it.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …I showed her how to dangle.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: “…a good little monkey and…”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She helped me to learn how to read.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And I showed her to swing.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sometimes we’d just sit out and wait for
the stars.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma’s gonna worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Just stay a little longer.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: For some reason, Jenny didn’t never want to
go home.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay, Jenny. I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She was my most special friend.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: My only friend.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, my Momma always told me that miracles
happen every day. Some people don’t think so, but they do.</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: Hey… dummy!</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?</p>
<p><strong>boy #3</strong>: Look, I’m Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Just run away, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run away! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: Get the bikes!</p>
<p><strong>boy #3</strong>: Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>boy #3</strong>: Let’s get him! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: Look out, dummy, here we come!</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: We’re gonna get you!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest! Run!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: Come back here, you!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest! Run!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, you wouldn’t believe it if I told
you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But I can run like the wind blows.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: From that day on, if I was going somewhere,
I was running!</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: He’s gettin’ away! Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>old crony</strong>: That boy sure is a running fool.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now remember how I told you that Jenny
never seemed to want to go home? Well, she lived in a house that was as
old as Alabama. Her Momma had gone up to heaven when she was five and
her daddy was some kind of a farmer.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Jenny? Jenny?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: He was a very lovin’ man. He was always
kissing and touchin’ her and her sisters. And then this one time, Jenny
wasn’t on the bus to go to school.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Jenny, why didn’t you come to school
today?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hsh! Daddy’s takin’ a nap.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s dad</strong>: Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s dad</strong>: Jenny, where’d you run to? You’d better
come back here, girl!</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s dad</strong>: Where you at?</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s dad</strong>: Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s dad</strong>: Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,
far, far away from here. Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far,
far away from here.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma always said that God is
mysterious.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s dad</strong>: Jenny! Get back here!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: He didn’t turn Jenny into a bird that day.
Instead…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …he had the police say Jenny didn’t have to
stay in that house no more. She went to live with her grandma just over
on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy ’cause she was so close.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Some nights, Jenny’d sneak out and come
over to my house, just ’cause she said she was scared. Scared of what, I
don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …but I think it was her grandma’s dog. He
was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …all the way to high school.</p>
<p><strong>older boy #1</strong>: Hey, stupid!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Quit it!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest, run!</p>
<p><strong>older boy #1</strong>: Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>older boy #2</strong>: Come on, he’s getting away! Move
it!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest! Run!</p>
<p><strong>older boy #1</strong>: You better be runnin’, stupid.</p>
<p><strong>older boy #2</strong>: Come on, dummy!</p>
<p><strong>older boy #1</strong>: Haul ass, dummy!</p>
<p><strong>older boy #1</strong>: Yeah, you better be runnin’!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Ya-hoo!</p>
<p><strong>older boy #1</strong>: Move it, jack rabbit!</p>
<p><strong>older boy #1</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on, Forrest!
Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Run, Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, it used to be, I ran to get where I
was goin’. I never thought it would take me anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>older boy</strong>: Come on. Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p><strong>football coach</strong>: Who in the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>high school coach</strong>: That there is Forrest Gump.
Coach. Just a local idiot.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And can you believe it? I got to go to
college, too.</p>
<p><strong>football coach</strong>: Okay! Run!</p>
<p><strong>football coach</strong>: Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch!
Run!</p>
<p><strong>football coach</strong>: You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!
Run!</p>
<p><strong>football coach</strong>: Run! Turn! Go!</p>
<p><strong>football coach</strong>: He must be the stupidest son-of-a-
bitch alive. But he sure is fast!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, maybe it was just me but college was
very confusing times.</p>
<p><strong>chet huntley</strong>: Federal troops enforcing a court order
integrated the University of Alabama today.</p>
<p><strong>chet huntley</strong>: Governor George Wallace had carried
out his symbolic threat to stand in the schoolhouse door.</p>
<p><strong>governor wallace</strong>: We hereby denounce and forbid this
illegal and unwarranted action by the central government.</p>
<p><strong>katzenbach</strong>: Governor Wallace, I take it from that,
uh…</p>
<p><strong>katzenbach</strong>: …statement that you are going to stand
in that door, and that you are not going to carry out the orders of this
court, and that you are going to resist us from doing so. I would ask
you once again to responsibility step aside and if you do not, I’m going
to assure you…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Earl, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Coons are tryin’ to get into school.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Coons? When raccoons try to get on our back
porch, Momma just chase ’em off with a broom.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Not raccoons, you idiot, niggas. And they want
to go to school with us.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: With us? They do?</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: …block the doorway, President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense then to use the military force.</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: Here by videotape is the encounter by
General Graham, Commander of the National Guard, and Governor
Wallace.</p>
<p><strong>governor wallace</strong>: We must have no violence today, or
any other day, because these National Guardsmen are here today as
Federal Soldiers for Alabamans. And they live within our borders and
they are all our brothers. We are winning in this fight because we are
awakening the American people to the dangers that we have spoken about
so many times, just so evident today, the trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: And so at day’s end the University of
Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated and students Jimmy Hood and
Vivian Malone had been signed up for summer classes.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Ma’am, you dropped your book. Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>chet huntley</strong>: Governor Wallace did what he promised
to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob from gathering
and prevented violence.</p>
<p><strong>assistant coach</strong>: Say, wasn’t that Gump?</p>
<p><strong>chet huntley</strong>: NBC News will present a special
program on the Alabama integration story at 7:30 p.m. tonight…</p>
<p><strong>assistant coach</strong>: Naw, that couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>football coach</strong>: It sure as hell was.</p>
<p><strong>chet huntley</strong>: …standard Eastern Daylight Time. Now a
word from Anacin.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: A few years later, that angry little man at
the schoolhouse door thought it would be a good idea, and ran for
President.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But, somebody thought that it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But he didn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: My bus is here.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Is it the number 9?</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: No, it’s the number 4.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It was nice talkin’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>white woman</strong>: I remember when that happened, when
Wallace got shot. I was in college.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Did you go to a girls’ college, or to a
girls’ and boys’ together college?</p>
<p><strong>white woman</strong>: It was co-ed.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: ’Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn’t
go to. It was a college just for girls.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But, I’d go and visit her every chance I
got.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Ouch! That hurts.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it! Stop

<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, he’s not!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who is that? Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Get over there!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Billy, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What in the hell, git, would you git away

<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t… Wait a second!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Git, just git away from me!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t go! Billy, wait a second!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He doesn’t know any better!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I brought you some chocolates. I’m sorry.
I’ll go back to my college now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Is this your room?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you’re
gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Who I’m gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Aren’t I going to be me?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well, you’ll always be you, just another kind
of you. You know? I want to be famous.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I want to be a singer like Joan Baez. I just
want to be an empty stage with my guitar, my voice… just me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And I want to reach people on a personal
level. I want to be able to say things, just one-to-one.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I sit next to them in my home economics
class all the time.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: You’re listening to WHHY in Birmingham, the
clear A.M. voice of Northern Alabama. I’m Joel Dorn…</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: …coming to you on a night that is anything but

WHHY.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Ohh… Oh… I’m sorry. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: …444-6789, with ya till sunrise, playing the
music you want to hear when you want to hear it. If you have a request
or dedication, give us a call. We guarantee you’ll hear your requests

<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: Candy is on the line tonight. Candy’s answering
the phones, give Candy your request, your dedication, and ask her why
she won’t go out with me, would you? Here’s more music.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Oh, I’m dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I bet that never happened in home ec.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I think I ruined your roommate’s

<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Run! Run! Run!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Run! Run! Run!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: College ran by real fast ’cause I played so
much football.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: They even put me on a thing called the
All-America Team where you get to meet the President of the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: President Kennedy met with the Collegiate
All-American Football Team at the Oval Office today.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, the real good thing about meeting the
President of the United States is the food.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: They put you in this little room with just
about anything you’d want to eat or drink. And since number one, I
wasn’t hungry, but thirsty…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …and number two, they was free, I musta
drank me about fifteen Dr. Peppers.</p>
<p><strong>president kennedy</strong>: Congratulations. How does it feel
to be an All-American?</p>
<p><strong>1st player</strong>: It’s an honor, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>president kennedy</strong>: Congratulations. How does it feel
to be an All-American?</p>
<p><strong>2nd player</strong>: Very good, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>president kennedy</strong>: Congratulations. How does it feel

<p><strong>president kennedy</strong>: Congratulations. How do you
feel?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I gotta pee.</p>
<p><strong>president kennedy</strong>: I believe he said he had to go
pee.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sometime later, for no particular reason,
somebody shot that nice young President when he was ridin’ in his
car.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And a few years after that…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …somebody shot his little brother, too,
only he was in a hotel kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It must be hard being brothers. I wouldn’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now can you believe it? After only five
years of playing football, I got a college degree.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Congratulations, son.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma was proud.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Forrest, I’m so proud of you. Here, I’ll
hold this for you.</p>
<p><strong>military recruiter</strong>: Congratulations, son. Have you
given any thought to your future?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Thought?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hello, I’m Forrest…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>army bus driver</strong>: Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you
are, fuzzball! You’re not even a lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get your
faggoty ass on the bus. You’re in the Army now!</p>
<p><strong>recruit #1</strong>: This seat’s taken.</p>
<p><strong>recruit #2</strong>: It’s taken.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: At first, it seemed like I made a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …seeing how it was my induction day and I
was already gettin’ yelled at.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: You can sit down… if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I didn’t know who I might meet or what they
might ask.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: You ever been on a real shrimp boat?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: No, but I been on a real big boat.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I’m talkin’ about a shrimp catchin’ boat.
I’ve been workin’ on shrimp boats all my life. I started out my uncle’s
boat, that’s my mother’s brother, when I was about maybe nine. I was
just lookin’ into buyin’ a boat of my own and got drafted. My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: People call me Bubba. Just like one of them
redneck boys. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: My name’s Forrest Gump. People call me
Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama,
and his momma cooked shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And her momma before her cooked shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And her momma before her momma cooked
shrimp, too. Bubba’s family knew everything…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …there was to know about the shrimpin’
business.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I know everything there is to know about the
shrimpin’ business. Matter of fact, I’m goin’ into the shrimpin’
business for myself after I get out the Army.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: Gump! What’s your sole purpose in
this Army?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: To do whatever you tell me, Drill
Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: Godamnit, Gump! You’re a goddamned
genius! That’s the most outstanding answer I’ve ever heard. You must
have a godamned I.Q. of a hundred and sixty! You are godamned gifted,
Private Gump!</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: Listen up, people…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs. It’s not really hard. You just make your
bed real neat and remember to stand up straight.</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: That is one very intelligent
individual! You lock your scuzzy bodies up behind that private and do
exactly what he does and you will go far in this man’s army!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And always answer every question with “Yes,
Drill Sergeant!”</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>forrest &amp; recruits</strong>: Yes, Drill Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: What you do is you just drag your nets across
the bottom. On a good day, you can catch over a hundred pounds of
shrimp. If everything goes all right, two men shrimpin’ ten hours, less
what you spends on gas, you can…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Done, Drill Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: Gump!</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: Why did you put that weapon together
so quickly, Gump?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You told me to, Drill Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: Jesus Christ! This is a new company
record. If it wouldn’t be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, I’d
recommended you for O.C.S., Private Gump. You are gonna be a General
some day, Gump! Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Anyway, like I was sayin’, shrimp is the
fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute
it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: …shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried, stir
fried. There’s pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper
shrimp…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: …shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad,
shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich… that’s, that’s
about it.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Nighttime in the Army is a lovely time.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: We’d lay there in our bunks, and I’d miss
my momma. And I’d miss Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>young private</strong>: Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on
her!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some
trouble over… some photos of her in her college sweater. And she was
thrown out of school.</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: “My baby does the hanky-panky…”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But that wasn’t a bad thing. Because a man
who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, saw those photo and offered
Jenny a job singing in a show. The first chance I got, I took the bus up
to Memphis to see her perform in that show.</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give her a big
hand, guys. Good job, Amber. And now, for your listening and viewing
pleasure, direct from Hollywood, California, our very own beatnik
beauty, let’s give a big round of applause to the luscious Bobbie
Dylan.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Bobbie… Bobbie…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: “Yes, and how many seas must the white dove
said, before she sleeps in the sand.”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Her dream had come true. She was a folk
singer.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: “Yes, how many times must the cannonballs fly
before they’re forever banned.”</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: You gotta lose the guitar, darling.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Hey, come on, baby. Shake it up. Shake it up
now.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: Hey, somebody ought to get her a
harmonica.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: “The answer, my friend is blowing in the
wind. The answer is blowing in…</p>
<p><strong>man #</strong>: …skin, honey. This isn’t Captain
Kangaroo.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Yeah! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>man #5 :</strong>: Hey, honey, I got something here for
you.</p>
<p><strong>man #5</strong>: Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I’m singing a song
here. Polly, get out here!</p>
<p><strong>man #</strong>: Hey, show us some stuff, honey!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Shut up! Oh, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, what are you doing here? What are
you doing?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What are you doing? Forrest, let me down!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You can’t keep doing this, Forrest. You can’t
keep tryin’ to rescue me all the time.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: They was tryin’ to grab you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: A lot of people try to grab me. Just – you
can’t keep doing this all the time!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I can’t help it. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, you don’t know what love is.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You remember that time we prayed, Forrest? We
prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You think I can fly off this bridge?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: What do you mean, Jenny?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I gotta get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But wait. Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, you stay away from me, okay? You
just stay away from me, please.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Can I have a ride?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Get in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin’ me to
Vietnam. It’s this whole other country.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Just hang on a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Listen, you promise me something, okay? Just
if you’re ever in trouble, don’t try to be brave, you just run, okay?
Just run away.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay. Jenny, I’ll write you all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And just like that.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: You come back safe to me, do ya hear?</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: “Some folks are born made to wave the flag.
Ooh, they’re red, white and blue. And when the band plays”Hail to the
Chief,” ohh, they point the cannon at you all. It ain’t me. It ain’t me.
I ain’t no Senator’s son, no. It ain’t me. It ain’t me…”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, they told us that Vietnam was gonna be
very different from the United Sates of America.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Except for all the beer cans and the
barbecue, it was.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Y’know, I bet there’s shrimp all in these
waters. They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp. You know, after we
win this war, and we take over everything we can get American shrimpers
to come on here and shrimp these waters. We’ll just shrimp all the time,
man. So much shrimp, why, you wouldn’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: You must be my F.N.G.’s.</p>
<p><strong>bubba and forrest</strong>: Morning’, sir!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute me.
There are goddamned snipers all around this area who would love to
grease an officer. I’m Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth
Platoon.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: What’s wrong with your lips?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I was born with big gums, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Yeah, well, you better tuck that in. Gonna
get that caught on a trip wire. Where you boys from in the world?</p>
<p><strong>bubba &amp; forrest</strong>: Alabama, sir!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: You twins?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: No, we are not relations, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Look, it’s pretty basic here.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: You stick with me, you learn from the guys
who been in country awhile, you’ll be right. There is one item of G.I.
gear that can be the difference between a live grunt and a dead
grunt.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green. Try and
keep your feet dry when we’re out humpin’. I want you boys to remember
to change your socks wherever we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt’s
feet right off his legs.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is that
sling-rope I told you to order.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. sims</strong>: I put in requisitions at Battalion.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those
sonabitches again, call them again and again and again. I don’t care how
much it takes…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt real
lucky he was my lieutenant. He was from a long, great military
tradition. Somebody in his family had fought and died in every single
American war.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Goddamnit, kick some ass!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. sims</strong>: I’m on it, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Get on it!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I guess you could say he had a lot to live
up to.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh? Well,
I’ve been through there. Little Rock’s a fine town. Now, go shake down
your gear, see the platoon sergeant, draw what you need for the
field.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: If you boys are hungry, we got steaks
burnin’ right here.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Two standing orders in this platoon. One,
take good care of your feet. Two, try not to do anything stupid, like
gettin’ yourself killed.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I sure hope I don’t let him down.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I got to see a lot of countryside. We would
take these real long walks.</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: And we were always lookin’ for this guy named
Charlie. I can’t get no relief.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Hold it up!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. sims</strong>: Hold up, boys!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It wasn’t always fun. Lt. Dan always
gettin’ these funny feelings about a rock or a trail, or the road, so
he’d tell you to get down, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Get down! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So we did.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, I don’t know much about anything, but
I think some of American’s best young men served in this war. There was
Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>cleveland</strong>: Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the hell’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And Tex was, well, I don’t remember where
Tex come from.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Ah, nothin’. Fourth Platoon, on your feet!
Still got ten clicks to go to that river.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: All right, move out! Comin’ out. Look alive
out there.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: The good thing about Vietnam is there was
always someplace to go.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Fire in the hole!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And there was always something to do.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Mount ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. sims</strong>: Spread out! Cover his back.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: One day it started raining, and it didn’t
quit for four months.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: We been through every kind of rain there
is. Little bitty stingin’ rain…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …and big ol’ fat rain.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Rain that flew in sideways.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And sometimes rain even seemed to come
straight up from underneath.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Shoot, it even rained at night.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Hey Forrest…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hey Bubba…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I’m gonna lean up against you, you just lean
right back against me.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: This way, we don’t have to sleep with our
heads in the mud. You know why we a good partnership, Forrest? ‘Cause we
be watchin’ out for one another. Like brothers and stuff. Hey, Forrest,
there’s somethin’ I’ve been thinkin’ about. I got a very important
question to ask you. How would you like to go into the shrimpin’
business with me?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured
out, too. So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds
for gas, we can just live right on the boat. We ain’t got to pay no
rent. I’ll be the captain; we can just work it together. Split
everything right down the middle. Man, I’m tellin’ you, fifty-fifty.
And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can get.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: That’s a fine idea.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Bubba did have a fine idea.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I even wrote Jenny and told her all about
it. I sent her letters. Not every day, but almost. I told her what I was
doin’ and asked her what she was doing, and I told her how I thought
about her always.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And how I was looking forward to getting a
letter from her just as soon as she had the time I’d always let her know
that I was okay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Then I’d sign each letter, “Love, Forrest
Gump.”</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: “There’s something happenin’ here. What it is
ain’t exactly clear. There’s a man with a gun over there, telling’ me I
got to beware.”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: This one day, we was out walking, like
always, and then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain and the
sun come out.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Take cover!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Get that pig up here, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Forrest, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: …Strongarm, please be advised…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Medic, we got a man down!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Roger, Strongarm, be advised we have
incoming from the treeline at point blue plus two. A.K’s and
rockets…</p>
<p><strong>soldier with big machine gun</strong>: Misfire! Misfire!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Goddammit, Mac! Get that pig unfucked and
get it in the treeline!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Ah, Jesus! My unit is down hard and
hurting! 6 pulling back to the blue line, Leg Lima 6 out! Pull back!
Pull back!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Pull back!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest! Run! Run!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. sims</strong>: Pull back! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Run, goddammit, run!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Medic! Medic! Jesus, can I get a medic?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me
to.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I ran so far and so fast that pretty soon I
was all by myself, which was a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Bubba!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Bubba was my best good friend. I had to
make sure he was okay.</p>
<p><strong>1st soldier</strong>: Any friendlies out there?</p>
<p><strong>2nd soldier</strong>: Yeah, I’ve got three over there.</p>
<p><strong>1st soldier</strong>: Where the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Bubba?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And on my way back to find Bubba, well,
there was this boy laying on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Tex!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I couldn’t just let him lay there all
alone, scared the way he was, so I grabbed him up and run him out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And every time I went back looking for
Bubba, somebody else was saying, “Help me, Forrest. Help me.”</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: Can’t hear… Can’t hear…</p>
<p><strong>2nd wounded soldier</strong>: No sweat, man. Just lay back.
You’re gonna be okay. You’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I started to get scared that I might never
find Bubba.</p>
<p><strong>strongarm</strong>: You’re danger close for crack air,
over.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Roger, Strongarm, I know my position is
danger close! We got Charlie all over this area! I gotta have those fast
movers in here now! Over!</p>
<p><strong>strongarm</strong>: Six, Strongarm, we want…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan, Coleman’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: I know he’s dead! My whole goddamned
platoon is wiped out!</p>
<p><strong>strongarm</strong>: Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6, how copy you this
transmission? Over.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Goddammit! What are you doing? Leave me
here! Get away. Just leave me here! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>strongarm</strong>: Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is
Strongarm, be advised, your fast movers are inbound at this time,
over.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Then it felt like something just jumped up
and bit me.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Ah, something bit me!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can’t leave the
platoon! I told you to leave me there, Gump. Forget about me. Get
yourself out! Did you hear what I said! Goddammit, pull me down! Get
your ass out of here!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: I didn’t ask you to pull me out of there,
goddamn you! What the hell do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: To get Bubba.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: I got an air strike inbound right now.
They’re gonna nape the whole area.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That’s an
order!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I gotta find Bubba!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Forrest…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Bubba…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Oh, Bubba, no…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Naw, I’m gonna be all right.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Come on. Come on. Come here…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I’m okay, Forrest. I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Helo’s inbound. Pop smoke, get it up
there!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: If I’d a known this was gonna be the last
time me and Bubba was gonna talk, I’d a thought of something better to
say.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hey, Bubba…</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Hey, Forrest. Forrest, why’d this happen?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You got shot.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Then Bubba said something I won’t even
forget.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I wanna go home.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Bubba was my best good friend. And even I
know that ain’t something you can find just around the corner. Bubba was
gonna be a shrimpin’ boat captain, but instead he died right there by
that river in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: That’s all I have to say about that.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It was a bullet, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: A bullet?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That jumped up and bit you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the
buttocks. They said it was a million dollar wound, but the Army must
keep that money, ’cause I still ain’t seen a nickel of that million
dollars. The only good thing about being wounded in the buttocks…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …is the ice cream. They gave me all the ice
cream I could eat. And guess what. A good friend of mine was in the bed
right next door.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: It’s time for your bath, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Harper…</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Cooper, Larson, Webster, Gump, Gump…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit?
Turn it off!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: From the D.M.Z. to the Delta, you are
tuned to the American Forces Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6,
Saigon.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Good catch, Gump. You know how to play
this?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Come on, let me show you. Here.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Now the secret to this game is, no matter
what happens, never, never take your eye off the ball.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: For some reason, ping pong came very
natural to me.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: See, any idiot can play.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So I started playing it all the time.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I played ping-pong even when I didn’t have
anyone to play ping-pong with.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: The hospital’s people said it made me look
like a duck in water, whatever that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would
come and watch me play.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I played ping-pong so much, I even played
it in my sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Now, you listen to me. We all have a
destiny. Nothing just happens, it’s all part of a plan. I should have
died out there with my men! But now, I’m nothing but a goddamned
cripple! A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at me! Do you see that? Do
you know what it’s like not to be able to use your legs?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well… Yes, sir, I do.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Did you hear what I said? You cheated me. I
had a destiny. I was supposed to die in the field! With honor! That was
my destiny! And you cheated me out of it! You understand what I’m
saying, Gump? This wasn’t supposed to happen. Not to me. I had a
destiny. I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yo-You’re still Lieutenant Dan.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Look at me. What am I gonna do now? What am
I gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: P.F.C. Gump?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: As you were.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Son, you’ve been awarded the Medal of
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they want to
give me a me…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Ma’am, what’d they do with Lieutenant
Dan?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: They sent him home.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: The ceremony was kicked off with a candid
speech by the President regarding the need for further escalation of the
war in Vietnam. President Johnson awarded four Medals of Honor to men
from each of the Armed Services.</p>
<p><strong>president johnson</strong>: America owes you a debt of
gratitude, son.</p>
<p><strong>president johnson</strong>: I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: In the buttocks, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president johnson</strong>: Oh, that must be a sight.</p>
<p><strong>president johnson</strong>: I’d kinda like to see that.</p>
<p><strong>president johnson</strong>: Goddamn, son.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: After that, Momma went to the hotel to lay
down, so I went out for a walk to see our national capital.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Hilary, all right, I’ve got the vets, what
do you want me to do with them?</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: What are you doing here so late?</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: We’ve been waiting for you for half an hour,
so just get them in a line, will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures later.
You look great. Oh come on, get in this line, come on, come on right in
line. Come on, let him here, let him in here.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It’s a good thing Momma was resting, ’cause
the street was awful crowded with people looking at all the statues and
monuments. And some of them people were loud and pushy.</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: Okay, follow me! Come on.</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: Let’s move it out.</p>
<p><strong>vet</strong>: Hey, buddy, come on. We could use your
help.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Everywhere I went, I had to stand in
line.</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: Follow me, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: All right, come on, guys.</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: Stand here.</p>
<p><strong>vet</strong>: Hey, you’re a good man for doin’ this.
Good!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: We must declare to that fucking
impostor in the White House – Johnson. We ain’t going to work on your
farm no more! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: There was this man, giving a little talk.
And for some reason, he was wearing an American flag for a shirt…</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: Now, I’m going to bring up some
soldiers that are going to talk about the war, man…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …and he liked to say the “F” word. A lot.
“F” this and “F” that. And every time…</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: …that war has come home, and we have
to stop these politicians…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …he said “F” word, people, for some reason,
well, they’d cheer.</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: …these guys just told Lyndon Johnson
where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: Come on, man. Come up here, man.</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: Come on, get up there. Come on. Move, move.
Let’s go! Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vet</strong>: Come on, go. You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: Tell us a little bit about the war,
man.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: The war in Vietnam?</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: The war in Viet-fucking-nam!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: There was only one thing I could say about
the war in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …there was only one thing I could say about
the war in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: In Vietnam war…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hey, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: I’ll beat your head in, you goddamned
oinker!</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Christ, what’d they do with this?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: We can’t hear you! We can’t hear
anything!</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: This one! This one! Give me that!</p>
<p><strong>hilary</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …and that’s all I have to say about
that.</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: That’s so right on, man. You said it
all. What’s your name, man?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>abbie hoffman</strong>: Forrest Gump!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Forrest Gump!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest! Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It was the happiest moment of my life.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Jenny and me were just peas and carrots
again. She showed me around, and even introduced me…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …to some of her new friends.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Shut that blind, man. And get your white ass
away from that window. Don’t you know we in war here?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey man, he’s cool. He’s cool. He’s one of
us. He’s one of us.</p>
<p><strong>masai</strong>: Let me tell you about us.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I ran into a friend.</p>
<p><strong>masai</strong>: Our purpose here is to protect our black
leaders from the racial onslaught of the pig who wishes to brutalize our
black leaders, rape our women, and destroy our black communists.</p>
<p><strong>black panther</strong>: Masai, phone. Talk to these guys.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Who’s the baby killer?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This is my good friend I told you about. This
is Forrest Gump. Forrest, this is Wesley. Wesley and I live together in
Berkeley, and he’s the president of the Berkeley chapter of</p>
<p><strong>masai</strong>: Let me tell you something else.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, but…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No. Now! Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>masai</strong>: We are here to offer protection and help for
all of those who need our help, because we, the Black Panthers, are
against the war in Vietnam. Yes, we are against any war where black
soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates
them. Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers go to fight and
come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities as they sleep
in their beds at night. Yes, we are against all these racists and
imperial dog acts.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You are a fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest! Stop
it!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Oh, God. I shouldn’t have brought you here.
I should have known it was just gonna be some bullshit hassle.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: He should not be hitting you, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your
Black Panther party.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He doesn’t mean it when he does things like
this. He doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I would never hurt you, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know you wouldn’t, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I wanted to be your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You look
handsome in it. You do.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You know what?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m glad we were here together in our
national capitol.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Me too, Forrest. I have so much to tell you,
you won’t believe what’s been going on…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: We walked around all night, Jenny and me,
just talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She told me about all the travellin’ she’s
done.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And how she’d discovered ways to expand her
mind and learn how to live in harmony…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …which must be out west somewhere, ’cause
she made it all the way to California.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: “Smile on your brother, everybody get
together, try to love on another right now”</p>
<p><strong>young hippie</strong>: Hey, anybody want to go to San
Francisco?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>young hippie</strong>: Far out!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I was a very special night for the two of
us. I didn’t want it to end.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t go, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I have to, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Jenny? Things got a little out of hand. It’s
just this war and that, that lyin’ son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I would never
hurt you. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You know what I think? I think you should
go home to Greenbow. Alabama!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, we have very different lives, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I want you to have this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, I can’t keep this.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I got it just by doing what you told me to
do.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Why’re you so good to me?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You’re my girl.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ll always be your girl.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And just like that, she was gone out of my
life again.</p>
<p><strong>neil armstrong</strong>: That’s one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the surface is fine and powdery. I can,
I can pick it up loosely.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I thought I was going back to Vietnam, but
instead, they decided the best way for me to fight communists was to
play ping-pong. So I was in the Special Services, traveling around the
country cheering up all them wounded veterans and showing them how to
play…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …ping-pong. I was so good that some years
later…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …the Army decided I should be on the
All-American Ping-Pong Team. We were the first Americans to visit the
land of China in like a million years or something like that, and
somebody said that world peace was in our hands. But all I did was play
ping-pong. When I got home…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …I was national celebrity. Famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.</p>
<p><strong>dick cavett</strong>: Here he is, Forrest Gump, right
here.</p>
<p><strong>dick cavett</strong>: Mr. Gump, have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>dick cavett</strong>: Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</p>
<p><strong>john lennon</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>dick cavett</strong>: You had quite a trip. Can you, uh, tell
us, uh, what was China like?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well, in the land of China, people hardly
got nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>john lennon</strong>: No possessions?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And in China, they never go to church.</p>
<p><strong>john lennon</strong>: No religion, too?</p>
<p><strong>dick cavett</strong>: Oh. Hard to imagine.</p>
<p><strong>john lennon</strong>: Well, it’s easy if you try, Dick.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Some years later, that nice young man from
England was on his way home to see his little boy and was signing some
autographs. For no particular reason at all, somebody shot him.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: They gave you the Congressional Medal of
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now that’s Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant
Dan!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: They gave you the Congressional Medal of
Honor!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes sir, they sure did.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: They gave you an imbecile, a moron who goes
on television and makes a fool out himself in front of the whole damn
country, the Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Well, then, that’s just perfect! Yeah, well
I just got one thing to say to that. Goddamn bless America.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan said he was living in a
hotel. And because he didn’t have no legs, he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Take a right, take a right.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver #1</strong>: Hey! Come on already!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: What are you doing here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: I’m living off the government tit. Sucking
it dry.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind? I’m walking
here! Ah, get out…</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver #2</strong>: Why don’t you go home before you
kill yourself? Get out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Come on, go! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and celebrated
the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>bob hope</strong>: You have a great year and hurry home. God
bless you.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I didn’t know I was supposed to be looking
for him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: That’s all these cripples, down at the
V.A., that’s all they ever talk about.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I found
Jesus? They even had a priest come and talk to me. He said God is
listening, but I have to help myself. Now, if I accept Jesus into my
heart, I’ll get to walk beside him in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Did you hear what I said? Walk beside him
in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well, kiss my crippled ass. God is listening.
What a crock of shit.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Huh? Ah, well, before you go, why don’t you
get your ass down to the corner and get us another bottle of wine.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dick clark</strong>: We are at approximately 45th Street in
New York City at One Astor Plaza. This is the site of the old Astor
Hotel. Down below us, well over a hundred thousand people are milling
about, cheering with horns and whistles and hats…</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: What the hell’s in Bayou La Batre?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Shrimpin’ boats.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Shrimpin’ boats? Who gives a shit about
shrimpin’ boats?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin’ boats
as soon as I have some money. I made me a promise to Bubba in Vietnam,
that as soon as the war was over, we’d go in partners. He’d be the
captain of the shrimpin’ boat and I’d be his first mate. But now that
he’s dead, that means that I gotta be the captain.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: A shrimp boat captain.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,
Lieutenant Dan.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Now hear this! Private Gump here is gonna
be a shrimp boat captain. Well, I tell you what, Gilligan, the day that
you are a shrimp boat captain, I will come and be your first mate.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: If you’re ever a shrimp boat captain,
that’s the day I’m an astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Danny, what are you complaining about?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What are you doing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Mr. Hot Wheels. Who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: This is Cunning Carla, and Long-Limbs
Lenore.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: So where you been, baby-cakes, huh? Haven’t
seen you around lately. You know, you should have been here for
Christmas ’cause Tommy bought a round on the house and gave everybody a
turkey sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Well, well, I had, uh, company.</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Hey, hey! We was, we was just there. That’s

<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Don’t you just love New Year’s? You get to
start all over.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hey, Lenore.</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Everybody gets a second chance.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It’s funny, but in the middle of all that
fun, I began to think about Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>dick clark</strong>: …getting wild out there. It’s beginning
to…</p>
<p><strong>dick clark</strong>: …pour here in Times Square. It’s been
off-and-on all night, but these people hang in there.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Wondering how she was spending her New
Year’s night out in California.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: …1! Happy New Year!</p>
<p><strong>patrons</strong>: “Should auld acquaintance be forgot and

something?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What, is your friend stupid or something?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I said, is your friend stupid or
something?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Hey! Don’t call him stupid!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Don’t push me like that!</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Hey, don’t you push her!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: You shut up! Don’t you ever call him
stupid!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What’s the matter, baby? Why you treating me
like shit?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Get the hell out of here!</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: You stupid gimp. You belong in “Ripley’s
Believe It Or Not.”</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Get the hell out of here! Go on!</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: You should be in a side show!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Go on! Get out of here! Get out of

<p><strong>carla</strong>: You retard!</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: You loser! You freak!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m sorry I ruined your New Year’s Eve
party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes like cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there’s some
things you just can’t change. He didn’t want to be called crippled, just
like I didn’t want to be called stupid.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Happy New Year.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: The U.S. Ping-Pong Team met with

<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And wouldn’t you know it…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …a few months later they invited me and the
ping-pong team to visit the White House. So I went again. And I met the
President of the United States again.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Only this time they didn’t get us rooms in
a real fancy hotel.</p>
<p><strong>president nixon</strong>: So are you enjoying yourself in our

care of it for you.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Security, Frank Wills.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yeah, sir, you might want to send a
maintenance man over to that office across the way. The lights are off,
and they must be looking for the fuse box or something, ’cause them
flashlights they’re, they’re keeping me awake.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Okay, sir. I’ll check it out.</p>

<p><strong>president nixon</strong>: Therefore, I shall resign the
Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>president nixon</strong>: Vice President Ford will be sworn

for America with which we began this second term, I feel a great sadness
that I will not be here in this office…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sergeant Gump!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>

Your service is up, son.</p>

<p><strong>officer</strong>: For the Army it does.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And just like that, my service in the
United States Army was over. So I went home.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m home, Momma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Louise, he’s here. He’s here,
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, when I got home, I had no idea that
Momma had had all sorts of visitors.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: We’ve had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.
Everybody wants you to use their ping-pong stuff. One man even left a
check for twenty-five thousand dollars if you’d be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Oh, Momma. I only like using my own paddle.
Hi, Miss Louise.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Hey, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: I know that. I know that. But it’s
twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest. I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you. Oh, you look good, Forrest. You
look real good.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: That Momma, she sure was right. It’s funny
how things work out.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I didn’t stay home for long, because I’d
made a promise to Bubba. And I always try to keep my promise. So I went
on down to Bayou La Batre to meet Bubba’s family and make their
introduction.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blue</strong>: Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blue</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And of course, I paid my respect to Bubba
himself.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hey, Bubba, it’s me, Forrest Gump. I
remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m taking the twenty-four thousand, five
hundred and six-two dollars and forty-seven cents that I got…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …well, that’s left after a new hair cut and
a new suit and I took Momma out to real fancy dinner and I bought a bus
ticket and three Doctor Peppers.</p>
<p><strong>old shrimper</strong>: Tell me something. Are you stupid or
something?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Stupid is as stupid does, sir.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well, that’s what’s left after me saying,
“When I was in China on the All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just loved
playing ping-pong with my Flex- O-Ping-Pong Paddle.” Which everybody
knows it isn’t true, but Momma says it’s just a little white lie so it
wouldn’t hurt nobody. So, anyway, I’m putting all that on gas, ropes and
new nets and a brand-new shrimpin’ boat.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, Bubba had told me everything he knows
about shrimpin’, but you know what I found out? Shrimpin’ is tough.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I only caught five.</p>
<p><strong>old shrimper</strong>: A couple of more, you can have
yourself a cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>old shrimper</strong>: Hey, you ever think about namin’ this
old boat?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’d never named a boat before, but there
was only one I could think of.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: The most beautiful name in the wide
world.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, I hadn’t heard from Jenny in a long
while. But…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But I thought about her a lot. And I hoped
that whatever she was doing made her happy.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I thought about Jenny all the time.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Well, I thought I’d try out my sea
legs.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well, you ain’t got no legs, Lieutenant
Dan.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I had to
see this for myself. And I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat
captain, that I’d be your first mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of my
word.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Yeah, but don’t you be thinking that I’m
gonna be calling you sir.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: That’s my boat.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: I have a feeling if we head the east, we’ll
find some shrimp. So, take a left. Take a left.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Over there! They’re over there! Get, get on
the wheel and take a left!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Gump, what are you doing? Take a left!
Left! That’s where we’re gonna find those shrimp, my boy! That’s where
we’ll find ’em.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Okay, so I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well, how we gonna find them?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Well, maybe you should just pray for
shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So I went to church every Sunday…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too. Though
I think he left the praying up to me.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: No shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Where the hell’s this God of yours?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It’s funny Lieutenant Dan said that, ’cause
right then, God showed up.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: You’ll never sink this boat!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant Dan,
he was mad.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Come on! You call this a storm?</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Blow, you son-of-a-bitch! Blow! It’s time
for a showdown! You and me. I’m right here. Come and get me! You’ll
never sink this boat!</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Hurricane Carmen came through here
yesterday…</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: …destroying nearly everything in its
path. And as in other towns up and down the coast, Bayou La Batre’s
entire shrimping industry…</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: …has fallen victim to Carmen and has been
left in utter ruin. Speaking with local officials, this reporter has
learned, in fact, only one shrimping boat actually survived the
storm.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Louise. Louise, there’s Forrest!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: After that, shrimpin’ was easy.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And since people still needed them shrimps
for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …and we were the only boat left standing
“Bubba-Gump” shrimp’s what they got. We got a whole bunch of boats.
Twelve Jenny’s, a big ol’ warehouse, we even have hats that says
“Bubba-Gump” on ’em. “Bubba- Gump Shrimp.” It’s a household name.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hold on there, boy. Are you telling me you’re
the owner of the Bubba- Gump Shrimp Corporation?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes, sir. We’ve got more money than Davy
Crocket.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Boy, I’ve heard some whoppers in my time, but
that tops them all. We was sitting next to a millionaire!</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: Well, I thought it was a very lovely
story. And you tell it so well. With such enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan
looks like?</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: Well, yes, I would!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: That’s him right there.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And let me tell you something about
Lieutenant Dan.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Forrest, I never thanked you for saving my
life.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: He never actually said so, but I think he
made his peace with God.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: For the second time in seventeen days,
President Ford escaped possible assassination today when a woman, Sarah
Jane Moore, fired on him as he stepped out of a hotel in San
Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Base to Jenny One. Base to Jenny One.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Jenny One, go Margo.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Forrest has a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Yeah, well you’ll have to tell them to call
him back. He is indisposed at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: His momma’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Lynett Alice Fromme, a follower of
Charles Manson better known as “Squeaky,” attempted to assassinate the
President as he was…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Where’s Momma?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: She’s upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Hi, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Oh, all right.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We sure got you straightened out, didn’t we,
boy?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: What’s the matter, Momma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: I’m dyin’, Forrest. Come on in, sit down
over here.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Why are you dyin’, Momma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: It’s my time. It’s just my time. Oh, now,
don’t you be afraid, sweetheart. Death is just a part of life. It’s
something we’re all destined to do. I didn’t know it, but I was destined
to be your momma. I did the best I could.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You did good, Momma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: Well, I happened to believe you make your
own destiny. You have to do the best with what God gave you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: What’s my destiny, Momma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: You’re gonna have to figure that out for
yourself. Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest. You never know what
you’re gonna get.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gump</strong>: I will miss you, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She had got the cancer and died on a
Tuesday. I bought her a new hat with little flowers on it.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And that’s all I have to say about
that.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Didn’t you say you were waiting for the
Number Seven bus?</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: There’ll be another one along
shortly.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero, and a national celebrity, and a shrimpin’ boat captain,
and a college graduate, the city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,
decided to get together and offered me a fine job.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So, I never went back to work for
Lieutenant Dan.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Though he did take care of my Bubba- Gump
money. He got me invested in some kind of fruit company. And so then I
got a call from him saying we don’t have to worry about money no
more.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And I said, “That’s good. One less
thing.”</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, Momma said there’s only so much
fortune a man really needs…</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: Praise the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …and the rest is just for showing off. So,
I gave a whole bunch of it to the Four Square Gospel Church.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La
Batre Fishing Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And even though Bubba was dead, and
Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I gave Bubba’s mommy Bubba’s share.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And you know what…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: She didn’t have to work in nobody’s kitchen
no more.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blue</strong>: Smells wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And ’cause I was godzillionaire and I liked
doing it so much. I cut that grass for free.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But at nighttime, when there was nothing to
do and the house was all empty, I’d always think of Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And then, she was there.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hello, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hello, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Jenny came back and stayed with me.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Maybe it was because she had nowhere else
to go. Or maybe it was because she was so tired, because she went to bed
and slept and slept like she hadn’t slept in years. It was wonderful
having her home.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Every day we’d take a walk, and I’d jabber
on like a monkey in a tree. And she’d listen about ping-pong and
shrimpin’ boats and Momma makin’ a trip to heaven. I did all the
talkin’. Jenny most of the time was real quiet.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …big ol’ gobs of rain and little bitty
stinging rain and rain…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How could you do this?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sometimes I guess there just aren’t enough
rocks.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I never really knew why she came back, but
I didn’t care. It was like olden times. We was like peas and carrots
again.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Every day I’d pick pretty flowers and put
them in her room for her.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And she gave me the best gift anyone could
ever get in the wide world.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, you can open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: New shoes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: They make them just for running.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And she even showed me how to dance. And,
well, we was like family… Jenny and me.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And it was the happiest time of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And this Fourth is witnessing one of the
largest fireworks displays in the nation’s two-hundred year history…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You done watching it?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …here in New York Harbor. After the
spectacular display of tall ships earlier, the Statue of Liberty…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Will you marry me? I’d make a good husband,
Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You would, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: But you won’t marry me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You don’t want to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Why don’t you love me, Jenny? I’m not a
smart man, but I know what love is.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Jenny?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, I do love you.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Where are you running off to?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m not running.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: That day, for no particular reason, I
decided to go for a little run.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So I ran to the end of the road, and when I
got there, I thought maybe I’d run to the end of town.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: President Carter, suffering from heat
exhaustion fell into the arms of security agents.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And when I got there…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …I thought maybe I’d just run across
Greenbow County. And I figured since I run this far, maybe I’d just run
across the great…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …state of Alabama. And that’s what I did I
ran clear across Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: For no particular reason, I just kept on
going. I ran clear to the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And when I got there, I figured since I’d
gone this far, I might as well turn around, just keep on going.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: When I got to another ocean, I figured
since I’ve gone this far, I might as well just turn back, keep right on
going.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: When I got tired, I slept. When I got
hungry, I ate.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: When I had to go, you know, I went.</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: And so, you just ran?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’d think a lot about Momma and Bubba, and
Lieutenant Dan, but most of all, I thought about Jenny. I thought about
her a lot.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: For more than two years now, a man named
Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep,
has been running across America.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Charles Cooper brings us this
report.</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: For the fourth time on his journey across
America, Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is about to
cross the Mississippi River again today.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ll be damned. Forrest…</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: Sir, why are you running?</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: Why are you running?</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Are you doing this for world
peace?</p>
<p><strong>3rd reporter</strong>: Are you doing this for women’s
right?</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: Or for the environment?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Or for animals?</p>
<p><strong>3rd reporter</strong>: Or for nuclear arms?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: They just couldn’t believe that somebody
would do all that running for no particular reason.</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I just felt like running.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I just left like running.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: It’s you. I can’t believe it’s really
you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Now, for some reason what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I mean, it was like an alarm went off in
my head, you know. I said, here’s a guy that’s got his act together.
Here’s somebody who’s got it, all figured out. Here’s somebody who has
the answer. I’ll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: So, I got company.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And after that I got more company. And
then…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …even more people joined in. Somebody later
told me…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …it gave people hope. Now… Now, I don’t
know anything about that, but…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Some of those people asked me if I could
help them out.</p>
<p><strong>aging hippie</strong>: Hey, man, hey, listen. I was wondering
if you might help me, huh? Listen, I’m in the bumper sticker business
and I’ve been trying to think up a good slogan. And since you have been
such a big inspiration to the people around here, I thought you might be
able to help me jump into… Whoa! Man, you just ran through a big pile of
dogshit!</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It happens.</p>
<p><strong>aging hippie</strong>: What, shit?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And some years later I heard that fella did
come up with a bumper sticker slogan…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …and he make a lot of money off of it.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Another time I was running along, somebody
who had lost all his money in the T-shirt business, and he wanted to put
my face on a T-shirt, but he couldn’t draw that well and he didn’t have
a camera.</p>
<p><strong>wild-eyed man</strong>: I think it would be really fortunate
for me if I could get your name on these, oh, your face and name on
these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>wild-eyed man</strong>: Here, use this one. Nobody likes that
color anyway.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And some years later I found out that that
man did come up with a idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot of money off
of it.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Anyway, like I was saying, I had a lot of
company. My Momma always said you got to put the past behind you before
you can move on. And I think that’s what my running was all about. I had
run for three years, two months, fourteen days, and sixteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Quiet. Quiet, he’s gonna say
something.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’m pretty tired. I think I’ll go home
now.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Now what are we supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And just like that, my running days was
over. So, I went home to Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Moments ago, at two twenty-five p.m., as
President Reagan was leaving the Washington Hilton Hotel…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …five or six gunshots were fired by an
unknown would-be assassin. The President was shot in the chest and the
assailant was immediately tackled by a half a dozen lawmen. As the
Presidential…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I picked up the mail.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: One day, out of the blue clear sky, I got a
letter from Jenny…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …wondering if I could come down to Savannah
to see her, and that’s what I’m doing here. She saw me on TV, running,
I’m supposed to go on the Number Nine bus to Richmond Street and get off
and go one block left to 1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4.</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: Why, you don’t need to take a bus.
Henry Street is just five or six blocks down that way.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Down that way?</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: Down that way.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It was nice talking’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: I hope everything works out for
you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey! Forrest! How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come in. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I got your letter.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, I was wondering about that.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Is this your house?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, it’s messy right now. I just got off
work.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It’s nice. You got air conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Ah…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I ate some.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of your, of
your clippings and everything. There you are. This, I got your
running.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I ran a long way. For a long time.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: There. Listen, Forrest. I don’t know how to
say this. Um, I just… I want to apologize for anything that I ever did
to you, ’cause I was messed up for a long time, and…</p>
<p><strong>lynn marie</strong>: Yoo-hoo.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>lynn marie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, you. This is an old friend from
Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>lynn marie</strong>: Oh, how do you do?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Ah, listen, next week my schedule changes, so
I’ll be able to… but thanks for picking up.</p>
<p><strong>lynn marie</strong>: No problem. Got to go, Jen. I’m double
parked.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lynn marie</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Thanks. This is very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Hello, Mr. Gump.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Now, can I go watch TV now?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes, you can. Just keep it low.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You’re a momma, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m a momma. His name is Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Like me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I named him after his Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: He got a daddy named Forrest, too?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re his daddy, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at me,
Forrest. There’s nothing you need to do, okay? You didn’t do anything
wrong. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Isn’t he beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: He’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever
seen. But… is, is he smart, or is he…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He’s very smart. He’s one of the smartest in
his class.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, it’s okay. Go talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Hey, Bert, can you give me a hand?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want,
Ernie?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: What are you watching.</p>
<p><strong>forrest jr.</strong>: Bert and Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Well, it’s the first stage. Bert. It’s
planning to write a story, Bert. I have pencils right here to write
with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper. I’ll take that paper, Bert. See, we
have the paper to write on.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forrest, I’m sick.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: What, do you have a cough due to cold?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I have some kind virus. And the doctors
don’t, they don’t know what it is. And there isn’t anything they can do
about it.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You could come home with me. Jenny, you and
little Forrest could come stay at my house in Greenbow. I’ll take care
of you if you’re sick.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Would you marry me, Forrest?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Please take your seats.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Forrest, it’s time to start.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hi. Your tie.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Hello, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You got new legs. New legs!</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Yeah, I got new legs.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: Custom-made titanium alloy. It’s what they
use on the space shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Magic legs.</p>
<p><strong>lt. dan</strong>: This is my fiancee, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hi, Forrest.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, it’s nice to meet you, finally.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be your
wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest to be your husband? If so, I pronounce
you man and wife.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, Forrest, were you scared in Vietnam?</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Yes. Well, I, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Sometimes it would stop raining long enough
for the stars to come out. And then it was nice. It was like just before
the sun goes to bed down on the bayou…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: There was over a million sparkles on the
water. Like that mountain lake.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: It was so clear, Jenny. It looks like there
were two skies, one on top of the other. And then in the desert, when
the sun comes up…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I couldn’t tell where heavens stopped and
the earth began. It was so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I wish I could have been there with you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You were.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: You died on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And I had you placed here under our
tree.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And I had that house of your father’s
bulldozed to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Momma…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …always said dyin’ was a part of life.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I sure wish it wasn’t. Little Forrest, he’s
doing just fine.</p>
<p><strong>forrest jr.</strong>: “But he wasn’t quite sure. Everywhere
they went, the new guests…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: About to start school again soon. I make
his breakfast, lunch, and dinner…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …every day. I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day. Teaching him how to play ping pong.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: He’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Forrest, you go.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: We fish a lot.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: And every night, we read a book. He’s so
smart, Jenny. You’d be so proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a letter,
and he says I can’t read it. I’m not supposed to, so I’ll just leave it
here for you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Jenny, I don’t know if Momma was right or
if, if it’s Lieutenant Dan. I don’t know if we each have a destiny, or
if we’re all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I
think maybe it’s both. Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss
you, Jenny. If there’s anything you need, I won’t be far away.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Here’s your bus. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hey, I know this.</p>
<p><strong>forrest jr.</strong>: I’m gonna show that for show-and- tell
because grandma used to read it to you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: My favorite book.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: …okay. Hey, there you go.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: Hey, Forrest. Don’t… I wanted to tell you I
love you.</p>
<p><strong>forrest jr.</strong>: I love you too, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>forrest</strong>: I’ll be right here when you get back.</p>
<p><strong>schoold bus driver</strong>: You understand this is the bus
to school now, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>forrest jr.</strong>: Of course, and you’re Dorothy Harris
and I’m Forrest Gump.</p>
