<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: As yet POLICE have not ruled out the
possibility that this mutilated body could be connected with the murder
of NICKI LOWE, whose body was found on Hapthron Common last month. Last
night, novelist ELLEN CARTER was awarded the International Writers Guild
Award for her Book, ‘The Colour of fear’…</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: She was said to be ecstatic about the
award…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hello CRIME SCENE - yes, that’s me…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No - I’m sorry I haven’t made my payments -
Friday - Fine - OK?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No - I wont use the card… Fine… Thank you -
goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Could you do me a colour photocopy of this
now?</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: Which do you think is her best shot…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: The one on the left - definitely…</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: Don’t give me shit - what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’ve got a tenant coming over later - can I
take the afternoon off?</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done
by FRIDAY… FRIDAY?</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: Good - but change ‘I killed for love’ to ‘I
killed for sex’</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s not technically accurate - SIMPSONS
murders weren’t sexually motivated.</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: You know that circulation is down for three
months in a row.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I heard something like that</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: Then it’s going to be ‘I killed for sex’…
Listen darling, why won’t you let us use your real name for the features
- if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and
not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven’t
written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and
if circulation keeps dropping, there’s not going to be a magazine for
you to write for…</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: I don’t want to hear it…Now get out - I’ve
got deadlines</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I wouldn’t choose either…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I thought it might look better enlarged!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Could you fax this to this number as quickly
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s the photo I have just faxed to your
wife…</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: LANCE - Your wife is on line 3!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Send her my love…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Please be in and have tidied the house…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I thought you said you could get the
afternoon off to tidy the house!</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I’m sorry, I couldn’t - when is she due?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: At 2.00…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: You didn’t tell me her name.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: LESLIE…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: STECKLER…LESLIE STECKLER.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I like it…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You see MR STECKLER, er, I think that we may
have wasted your time. I don’t know why I didn’t say something earlier -
It’s just that we’re looking for a girl…The advert was for a girl.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Well - the ad just said third person… It
must have been a printing error.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: It doesn’t mention ‘females only’</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I really don’t know what to say</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’m really very sorry - I was banking on
this coming through, because it’s only five minutes from my surgery…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Surgery? Are you a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No - a dentist</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I have all my references ready - and I can
pay the first month and deposit now. It really is a glowing
reference!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: MR STECKLER - would you excuse us for one
moment?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Well, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I don’t know - it’s your house ELLEN</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes - but you live here too - If it were
your house?</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I think he’s fine - I don’t know why you have
this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a
change - I don’t think he would hurt a fly.</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: It’s your pad - it’s up to you</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: When do you want to move in?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Oh as soon as possible - tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Just put it in my room</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: No worries</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Oh, before I forget, here is key and the
tenancy agreement…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’ll finish off here…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I can manage -</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I said I can manage… I’m not weak you
know…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to shout…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Don’t worry about it -</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you
ELLEN?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Tell me - ELLEN CARTER Forgive me for
being so pushy, but aren’t you a novelist? Didn’t you write that
terrific book - ‘The Color of Fear’?</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: You’re a novelist - why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: And not just any novelist - a great
novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Why didn’t you write any more?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I lost the touch</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: The touch?</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Her husband left her</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Do you take sugar?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes, two please. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean
to pry, it’s just that I really loved your book</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: You kept that one quiet…what other skeletons
have you got in the cupboard?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Sorry, I thought it was you What the hell is
he doing?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What’s with all the locks - and
hammering</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: It says in the contract I can have a lock
fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: My names isn’t ANGELA…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes - I’m sorry ELLEN…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Don’t worry - Is that my hammer Well Just
make sure that it’s put back in the garage…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I will…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Locks huh!</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Is it any good?</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: ELLEN! I’m going now - I’ll stay at DEKLAN’S
tonight, I’ll see you tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: LESLIE - Are you hot?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: LESLIE - are you out here?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: We’d better get back inside!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Thank you - I’d better get changed…</p>
<p><strong>old whore</strong>: Oooh I say, I haven’t had the pleasure
for a long time! Still, variety is the spice of life…</p>
<p><strong>local</strong>: Well, I just saw these two women go in - I
thought I’d, you know - and I found her like that…</p>
<p><strong>forrester</strong>: We’ve found something!</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: Most of it was a mess of smears, but I got
one clean print here…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: How long before you can give me an idea?</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: I started the check already, but without
more specific physical ID - I can’t narrow the field down - could be a
month - that’s if she is on record</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Or he…</p>
<p><strong>news reader</strong>: Once more, LONDON has been plunged into
terror as the WHITE ANGEL strikes again. However, one fingerprint has
been found, and Police have issued a statement that if the killer is on
file, then they will have a positive identification within the
month…</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: It’s diabolical in’it, I mean it’s not safe
to walk the streets no more is it…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Anyway, HACKSAW JOE?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Sorry - yeah, well you see, JOE used to
single out people he wanted to get rid off - and he would weaken them
over a few weeks by giving them arsenic in small doses - on biscuits, in
their tea and coffee - it has a kind of sweet taste</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: He never give them enough to kill them mind,
just weaken them so that when he struck, they didn’t put up too much of
a fight - you see, JOE was only small - couldn’t take anyone bigger or
stronger on…well that’s when he did his thing with the hacksaw . It got
pretty nasty - you know…. a bit here, a bit there - we used to call him
JIGSAW JOE - But the point is this, even JOE had principles - not like
this scum who is roaming the streets now.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: It wouldn’t have happened twenty years
ago…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I see, crime was decent then</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: You’re damn right - I can’t even let my
daughter out at night now. Life is different now - it’s a jungle out
there - you’ve got to know who your friends are - protect yourself and
your own - know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: JANET -</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Er, you might as well knock off now - I’ll
shut up shop</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes, go home…</p>
<p><strong>spiv</strong>: Got a problem!?</p>
<p><strong>spiv</strong>: Come on Grandad!</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: My name is LESLIE - I’m a doctor and I
have a surgery just around the corner - you could call a taxi…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Anyone home?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Were nearly there - just up the
stairs….</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Its a nice room - spacious, you’ll like it
sweetie…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Just a few days - ELLEN wouldn’t
understand yet - yes I’m sure she will…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You want to see me</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: ELLEN CARTER - Now how are you doing these
days?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s been what, three years?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Could I have a private moment with
ELLEN?</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: No problem - I’ll be outside</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What brings the rats out of the sewers?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m here about the so called disappearance
of your husband - It’s best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?
I’m working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I’ve got to check all
known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years… And that
means you…So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You think I’m the WHITE ANGEL?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It did give me a chance to meet you again
ELLEN - It’s all routine you understand…So where were you?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: At home alone - where were you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe
we could solve each others problems?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Get out…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You know ELLEN, I believe you - I know that
you’re no serial killer - something else maybe, but no serial killer.
I’m assigning surveillance for your own protection - we couldn’t have
the once world famous novelist found with her head missing could we?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What happened to you - you used to have some
class</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Someone will find your husband one day - and
then I’ll have a body</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Catch you later…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I knew you did it - I just couldn’t figure
out what you had done with the body…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I knew you had killed him - I just felt it
- I’m surprised that the police didn’t suspect ‘foul play’ - everything
pointed that way…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Oh, I admit it’s a rather vulgar method -
but I needed to fire your Imagination…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: The reason I knew you killed your husband
- apart from the fact that he disappeared - is that you stopped writing
- he must have been a bastard to you - Anyway, I’m going to give you a
second chance to start anew.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You had better sit down</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You see ELLEN, there are parts of me you
haven’t encountered - parts that are more important - that most people
don’t or won’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I want you and your words to make people
understand - I’m commissioning a book</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I want people to understand the power any
man can use - to take what he needs, to take what he wants - I want
people to know why I do what I do - so that when I am finished, they
will understand the truth of my actions. I want THE ELLEN CARTER to
write the life story of LESLIE RAYMOND STECKLER</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I don’t have much time ELLEN - They have
my finger prints - they WILL catch me…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you - Your’e not my
type - I need your skills - don’t you see the divine perfection - you
and I are both carved from the same stone - it will be the perfect
partnership - your words - my story…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: And don’t think of calling the police
-</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: That’s where your husband is - It’s not
too far from here, but far enough. I have marked the map reference near
the tree and lodged it in my family safety deposit box</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: should anything ever happen to me - should
I die, get hit by a truck - or disappear, then I have instructed the
manager to turn the contents - along with an explanatory letter, over to
Scotland Yard - so lets just hope nothing happens to me.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Otherwise, you are free to do as you
will…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: As long as you write my book…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You have no choice ELLEN, you will write
this book…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Fuck…Oh Fuck …Oh fuck</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: OH MY GAWD!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m sorry - I didn’t think</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: A person could get killed round here just
for working late</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I thought you were someone else</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: Well I’m glad I’m not them - what are you
doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that
for?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I thought someone was following me - I - er
- I just needed my computer and some things…Listen, I’d like to work
from home for a few weeks - is that OK?</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: Why don’t you take a few weeks off - you’re
due some holiday time.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Sounds good - thank you</p>
<p><strong>dezerae</strong>: Don’t mention it - now can I get back to my
accounts, or do you want to fillet me?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Hello?… GRANDAD! It’s for you…</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Thank you Darling - you go on back to your
friends…</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hello, ALAN - It’s ELLEN CARTER here from
CRIME SCENE - yes - I remember you said that if I needed something, I
could come to you…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ALAN sent you - right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I want a gun - - There’s this guy, I think
he’s watching me - You know I’d just feel safer with a gun in the house
- I wouldn’t use it - just for show</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whatever you say Lady</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This’ll stop anything that moves</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No - something smaller I think</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Browning 9mm - holds 13 in the clip, one in
the chamber - and I’ll throw in two extra clips and a silencer…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I will need the bullets…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No problem - that’s a good gun - got a nice
action - try it…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: ELLEN! You’re back - come and join us… You must
be tired - LESLIE told me how you spent the whole day knocking out that
hole…Funny place to put a fish tank though.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I thought I would cook us a meal</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No thank you - I already ate</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Oh come on ELLEN, they’re the nicest ribs I
have ever tasted</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: LESLIE is a very talented cook - he says
there’s nothing he can’t do with red meat and wine!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m sure that’s true…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: If you want any - there’s some left in the
kitchen</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I think I will pass…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Dessert is on it’s way</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I think I misjudged him - he’s really quite
cute</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: You ought to get the heating seen to - it’s so
hot</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I would prefer it if you kept away from
LESLIE</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You heard me - keep away from him</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: You don’t own him you know - you can’t tell me
not to see him!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes I can…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Huh - fuck you - who trampled on your grave</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m giving you notice, I want you out.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I want you out now</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m your landlady</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Just because I have dinner with LESLIE - I
mean? What are you two fucking or something? Cause, if you are, I didn’t
know!</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Oh I understand</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: It’s the rent I’m due - take it then we are
equal</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I’ll be at DEKLAN’S, and I’ll come over to
collect my stuff in the next few days… Don’t mind my stuff if some guy
you fancy turns up - just leave it in the garden - I thought you were a
nice girl ELLEN - Looks like I was wrong</p>
<p><strong>voice of smith</strong>: Oh yeah, anyway - when he got them
weakened with the arsenic, just sprinkled it on their food for a few
days - like I said, just weakened them enough for him to GET THEM WHERE
HE WANTED THEM WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Sugar?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes, one and a half please.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I will write your book…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: But I have one demand - you will not kill
whilst I write</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Fine - you will have to work fast - it
will probably be only a few months before they identify my prints - and
then it is over - I will destroy all the evidence in my safety deposit
box - your secret will die with me… I’m so glad ELLEN</p>
<p><strong>voice of carter</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: LESLIE STECKLER</p>
<p><strong>voice of carter</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: What do I do? What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>voice of carter</strong>: I write - If this is going to work,
you are going to have to get used to talking to the camera - opening up
to it…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: So what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’m a dentist</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And how long have you been a dentist?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Oh, about six years since I graduated</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And how many people have you killed?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I don’t know</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No - the police say I’ve killed fourteen -
but I’ve not - I’ve killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven’t
found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don’t get
missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn’t even
show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press
called it - she wasn’t even mine - I don’t know who did it but I
didn’t</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Where do you kill them…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do
you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or
someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, ‘Look, I have
something to show you’ I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I
think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I
offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She
just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out
my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You
know what I want. - But she didn’t. Getting rid of the bodies is just as
easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them
off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight. The real problem with my work is
the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast -
like a fountain. It made such a mess of</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: my car I stopped working from my car. She
could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the
difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast
- If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to
yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I don’t know</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Because a dog will attack with a ferocity
and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run
it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the
beasts…Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything
working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a
pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of
fun and attention- so she doesn’t deserve any more -</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Didn’t DEBBIE deserve anymore?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No she didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What did you do with her?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You know everyone accuses me of being sick
- the press, the TV - but I’m not you know - they are - I don’t watch it
for entertainment every night - I don’t sit and watch it whilst eating
my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I
can’t hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their
processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn’t eat one of those
burgers, you don’t know what has gone in them!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a
woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it -</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE
because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes,
blonde hair…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Is ‘their’ colour an expression of their
inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are
people who wear white?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Is white an expression of innocence? Do you
crave innocence LESLIE?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Let me ask you, why do you wear black
ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Do you feel sorry for the girls you have
killed</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Why should I feel sorry - they’re
dead.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Hello - is ANNIE in?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Are you a journalist?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No - I’m an old friend of ANNIE’S - I
haven’t seen her for years - You must be GRAHAM? Is there something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m sorry - I’ve been hounded by the press -
ANNIE died over a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Are you sure you don’t want a glass?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No - thank you</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: So did you know her well? She never
mentioned you to me</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Not really We had a bit of a crush on each
other - Purely innocent I assure you - but she was fun - did she ever
tell you about her nick name - SMUDGY?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: SMUDGY? No…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes, everyone used to tease her about that
birth mark - you know the one she had on her…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m surprised you know about that - she
wouldn’t ever show anyone it</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Oh we got in a little tussle once - and
that’s when I saw it</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: So if you don’t mind me asking - how did
it happen</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Well - she was out late one night - just
went down to the newsagent for some cigarettes - and she didn’t come
back…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Three days later some kids found her in some
bushes - she had been…She had been… they said she died instantly…But I
don’t know how long she had to suffer before that bastard killed
her…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The worst thing was I had to go down and
identify her - she was so small and pale -</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: How can any human being do that to
another?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Bingo - the key…?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: my god…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Oh come on!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: How long have you been watching me?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I have something I have to show you…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Tell me about your wife…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: My wife My wife was the only one who
really deserved it. LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it’s your
fault… She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she
mothered me…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: then why did you marry her -</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: It seemed like a good idea at the time -
why did you marry your husband.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What didn’t you like about her?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I hated being treated like a failure -
looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have
known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore
maroon - I just wanted a white wedding I think she thought I was a
ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut
- I didn’t know until too late. One day, I came</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: home early and found her in bed with
another man. I don’t know who he was. It didn’t matter. She never saw
me. I sat and watched for half an hour before I knew what I had to
do.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I hated her for that. And I hated her for
not wearing white at our wedding. I was cheated. I couldn’t have what
everyone else could have - all my life I have denied purity…The only
time I really was at one with my wife was those precious few hours
before I had to cut her up - she was accepting of everything then…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I had to kill her. She was rotten. And
like my MOTHER said - cut away the dead wood or it will stop you doing
what you must do. The world is a better place without her. You should
understand better than anyone.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You are the first person I have ever told
any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN…we’re in the same
league</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I don’t think so…This isn’t a game you
know…There aren’t points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am
no killer.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You’ve killed but you’re not a killer</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s right…Don’t ever think that you and I
are the same - we’re not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do
for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre
role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: he beat me up - he abused me - and I just
snapped.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Tell me how it happened…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Why not? Please - it would help me</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: There’s not much to tell - I had just won my
prize for the book - and he hated me for it. He had hated the book, he
hated my success for so long - so he decided to make my life hell. There
are things I can’t tell you what he made me do - things I couldn’t tell
anyone… I wanted a divorce but he said he wouldn’t - then opportunity
just popped up…He was in the garage and I was in the car…I just let the
clutch up - he couldn’t get out of the way. I didn’t really mean to kill
him -just teach him a lesson - I guess if I had been thinking straighter
I wouldn’t have done it. I knew that if I was discovered I would go to
jail - even if it was manslaughter I would do time - and any time would
have been too much - I’ve seen what happens to people when they go to
prison - and what happens to them when they get out. I wasn’t going to
be one of them.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I knew I had to get rid of the body - so I
strung him up in the bath, slit his throat and drained him - covered him
in salt - to avoid the rotting - and bricked him up. Everyone believed
me when I told them he left the country - I</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: think they were glad he was gone. Everyone
except for that damn cop. He knows. Somehow he just knows.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And I have never told THAT to anyone
before</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: And how did it feel to be rid of him</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Wonderful - like a great release - He was a
malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without
him</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: There is something special about this
place - the green - in destruction there is creation - flesh rots to
fertilise the ground for life to thrive on.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: That is my wife…Nothing ever dies - it
just changes. I changed my wife.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I come here every so often - to pay my
respects</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’m weary ELLEN - of holding everything
inside of me - that’s why I need this book - In a few weeks it will be
over - the police will have me - I will make you a lot of money and your
career will be back on track -</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: For the book…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: So tell me about your MOTHER</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: My mother…? I never knew my real MOTHER -
I was adopted</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Tell me about your adopted MOTHER</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I had to - I have to see the beginning - now
tell me about your MOTHER</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: My MOTHER didn’t love me - she never loved
me - when I was fourteen I had a pet rabbit - and I killed it, just to
see what my mother would do… She bought me a goldfish and told me to
stop crying. Two days later she died in the accident</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You think I killed my MOTHER don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: My ADOPTED MOTHER - Whose house was so
cold I could see my breath in front of my face, whose furniture was so
valuable, no-one could sit on it, whose ornaments so rare, I couldn’t
have school friends round…My mother, who locked me in the attic when I
was naughty, who drove her husband to the grave, who brought lovers home
for weekends in the country - she was filth - Is that what you want me
to say… That I pushed her off the boat when she drowned, who wouldn’t
throw her a life buoy? Is that what you want me to say? Is IT?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No…I didn’t do it…I wish I had but I
didn’t. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: STEPHANIE?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: STEPHANIE loved me - she got some
insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough.
We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow…And we
did…We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be
the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to
electrocute me…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What was your relationship with
STEPHANIE?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: It was wrong - all my life I have been
cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn’t have been born - I was
a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I want it to stop - it all to stop…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Then make it stop…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I need to talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but…
Telling you all of this, writing the book… It feels good. Don’t get me
wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders… When I
tell you what I have done - I can’t believe it is me…Yet I know it was.
This is like a purging for me…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Psychiatrists would say that you are
confronting your demons</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Demons… This wouldn’t have been possible
without you… You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer
now…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Nothing could be better…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I really must cut down on sugar - it’ll be
the death of me…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Is DR. STECKLER here?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I thought it was you - how are you?</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I’m good - I was just making a delivery near
here, so I thought I would see if you were about…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes, come on in…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: No, I can’t I’ve got a million things to
deliver. I just wanted to say thank you for the other night - I know it
all got a little out of hand…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Anyway - look, I have moved in with DEKLAN now
- it’s a nice flat in a shitty area - but hey, Its home!</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: That’s good</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I’d really like it if you would come round some
time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes, that would be nice - I’ll call round
some time…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Good - I’ve got to dash - Say that I said hello
to ELLEN for me would you…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes - of course.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dr STECKLER?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard …Can I
have a word?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’ll be outside.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: How can I help SCOTLAND YARD then?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I believe you live with a MRS ELLEN
CARTER…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: MRS? I thought her husband was dead</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Or was it, she wished he was dead - that’s
it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather
sordid.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So she didn’t mention anything more about
it?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No - she isn’t in any trouble is she?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh no sir - just making some enquiries…Just
tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she’ll understand</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’ll be sure to…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Listen - whilst I’m here, I’ve been having
some problems with my back teeth - you couldn’t just take a look, see if
I need anything doing?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I shouldn’t really - I’m not your
surgeon…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Who said anything about surgery…It’ll only
take a moment.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: OK - just hop up…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Now open wide…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Mmm yes - there is a cavity here… Just
tell me if this hurts…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Bloody hell! Now I remember why I didn’t
want to go to the dentist…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You really should have that filled…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Thanks for your time - DR STECKLER…</p>
<p><strong>street punk</strong>: You got a prob…?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’m a doctor - my surgery is just around
the corner</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’ll just turn off the ALARM</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Sorry about that - lets get you up
here…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know how to thank you - I think he was
going to rape or kill me</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: If I were you, I’d stick to daylight and
wide open spaces from now on - lets get this off.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: It’s not bad - it looks a lot worse than
it is… You probably won’t need stitches</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is that it? Some war wound that turned out to
be</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: This will stop it making too much of a
mess</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m terribly sorry…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Don’t mention it…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I’ll call a taxi and make some tea while
you wait.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you - but don’t you want a cup?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No, I’m not thirsty thank you. I called a
taxi - they are very good here - he should be here very…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s not too bad -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know how to thank you - you have been
so kind - if only more people in the world could be more like you…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m MARY STANLEY - nice to meet you</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: LESLIE STECKLER…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Turn it off - I can’t handle that thing
anymore</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN.
When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I
haven’t dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I
can’t carry on - I won’t carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I
want a second chance…You are good to me - you don’t condescend, you’re
intelligent, and very beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You don’t disappoint or let me down ELLEN.
I want the woman who helped me put the past behind me by my side - if
she will have me for the short time I have left.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Open it…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You want me to wear this for you?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You want me to wear white for you? You must
be madder than I thought…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: But for how long - what will set you off
again? You’ll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a
white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You can’t just flush your past down the
toilet of life - you want a second chance - what about the girls you
killed - did they have a second chance - No - because you killed them.
And I’m good to you - I don’t condescend, and don’t let you down. You
know why LESLIE - because you’ve got me by the short and curlies - I
don’t have a choice, either I go to jail or to the grave! In answer to
your question LESLIE - No I won’t have you. Never.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Out - I may be some time</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Wait LESLIE…I…I…</p>
<p><strong>carters voice</strong>: “…and what of those killers which
stopped? there have been many documented serial killers who merely ended
their reign of terror - Jack The Ripper being one of the most
sensational. Others the French Hillside Slasher - took nineteen lives
then mysteriously stopped. What happened to him - did he die, was he
arrested and jailed for other charges, did he leave the country - or was
his carnal need fulfilled - his anger discharged? Only he will ever
know…”</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: We’ve got nothing to talk about</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: LESLIE I’m sorry - I - I didn’t know what to
think</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I thought we had a relationship built on
trust - and you just slap me in the face…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I am sorry…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: LESLIE? Is that good enough?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes - I suppose so…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s late and I’ve had too much to drink. I
can’t think straight now - we’ll talk about it in the morning…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: ELLEN…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I have stopped - you must believe me</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes - I believe I do…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You see, I am writing this article for CHIC
MAGAZINE</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: CHIC MAGAZINE?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes - it’s about bank safety deposit boxes -
I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show
me round.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well MISS TANDY - It’s not our policy to
show people round - but if you were a potential client - that would be a
different matter…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: When could I look round?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well, if you could come sometime just
before we close, then I could show you everything and then we could go
for a drink to discuss the finer points…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS…?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: BRIAN…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: But - If you could show me round now - and
I’ll meet you later?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: This is our demonstration box</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: And these are the keys - one for you - and
one for me</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: We insert together - and out it comes</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And this is where the client can view their
contents in private…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Its cramped in here isn’t it BRIAN</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Yes it is…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the
client lost the key?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Then we would have to call in our locksmith
to break the lock</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: So there is only one key…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And it can’t be forged?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I didn’t say that - I’m sure it could be,
but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo
ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we’ve been very strict
since then.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I could get my secretary to cover for me
this afternoon - If you want to go someplace now - it would save you
coming back</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes, I’m sure you could - but I can’t risk
you loosing your job</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: No -it’s no problem - I do it all the
time</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: All the time?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: No - not all the time - I mean</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I know what you mean - I’ll meet you at
VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don’t make any plans for this
evening…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hello ELLEN - looks like your doin’ some
more interior decorating!</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Sugar?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes - one please.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: ELLEN, would you like a cup - there’s
plenty in the pot</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No thanks -</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: INSPECTOR TAYLOR has told me that you are
connected with that killer - the WHITE GHOST…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: ANGEL…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Yes, sorry - He’s here to make sure that
you are alright</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I know why he’s here</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’d watch her mate - she has thing for men -
they disappear near her.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I think you had better leave</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: First finish your tea…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He doesn’t need to…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Do you think she doesn’t like me</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: If you need me, you know where I am…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You like playing with fire don’t you</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Why did you let him in?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: It’s got sugar in - you don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I don’t like sugar</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: There isn’t that much - you didn’t even
taste it - What’s wrong - don’t you like my tea?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s not that - I just don’t want any
sugar</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Why whats wrong with the sugar -</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: 42% pentathanol, 31% crysonal and 8.5%
Arsenic… This was really very crude ELLEN - I tasted it straight away -
I’m very familiar with arsenic - small doses over a long period of time
mount up and eventually incapacitate the victim - Why did you want to
incapacitate me ELLEN?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: WHY!!!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I haven’t been using it recently LESLIE</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your
face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What’s wrong ELLEN - you look
pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it
could be food poisoning?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I thought you believed me! Oh don’t worry
ELLEN, I poured the Ant poison down the drain - I just wanted you to
know what it felt like when I found out - unpleasant isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I could kill you now - no-one would ever
know - I would have won already - unpleasant isn’t it…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: You couldn’t do it - It’s not because you
can’t kill - it’s the not knowing - if the bank would send my package -
what would you do when the police come knocking…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Don’t be so sure…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I love you ELLEN, I would never hurt
you.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Oh - I’m sorry - I didn’t realise you
were…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: LESLIE - About you and me - I’ve been
thinking about what you said…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Maybe I have been fooling myself - I really
don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What do you say…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: whats wrong…what have I done wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should
wait…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: WAIT FOR WHAT!?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: WHAT DO YOU WANT!? IT’S NOT FAIR!!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: LESLIE?! that’s not the way grown adults act
-</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: they understand each other - the time isn’t
right - tonight will be right - I have some woman things to take care of
before we do anything.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Tonight will be the night - Now get dressed
and get off to work</p>
<p><strong>teller girl</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>teller girl</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes, I would like to open my safety deposit
box please. My name is ANGELA STECKLER, MRS…</p>
<p><strong>teller girl</strong>: One moment please.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven’t seen you
for a long time</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No - I’ve been abroad for a long time…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: There have been some changes since you were
last here - we now require a signature.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I shouldn’t say this - but you really
remind me of someone I know</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Oh really - you must remember me from when I
was a regular customer.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I wasn’t a manager here then MRS STECKLER -
don’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m terribly sorry - I have a bad
memory…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: No - it’s someone I met recently…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Could you remove your sunglasses
please?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Fine - could you follow me MRS STECKLER</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: This must be one of the old keys -</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes - I have had it for years.</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: ELLEN? ELLEN, I’m home…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: ELLEN, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: ANGELA? It can’t be - I killed you…</p>
<p><strong>voice of steckler</strong>: ELLEN - Why are you trying to
hurt me! Why? Have you gone mad?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Shut up you sick fuck!</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I don’t want either of us to come to any
harm - please…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You killed my friend!</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Please ELLEN - put the gun down…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: COME ON!!!</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I loved you ELLEN - why did you do
this?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s what you would do to me</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Pain is an illusion…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I had a look while you were asleep I think
that I am going to have to have two root canals done…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Don’t you want me now LESLIE</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: No - I’ll have you after</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: Open wide…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: This one is used for cutting through tooth
and bone…</p>
<p><strong>steckler</strong>: I always wanted to do it this way…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: These are for LESLIE…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I had an accident - I fell down stairs…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: Is LESLIE here?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No he had to - he’s just - he’s out…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: He saved my life you know - has he told
you…</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I cut myself with our electric knife - and if
LESLIE hadn’t been there, I would have probably bled to death - he
stopped the bleeding and got me to the hospital - the doctor said ten
minutes later and I would have been a stiff</p>
<p><strong>mik</strong>: I’d appreciate it if he got the flowers - you
know - to make matters worse, some bastard broke into our flat the other
day - the police came round to fingerprint it - they said if they’re on
record - they’ll catch them…</p>
<p><strong>voice of newsreader</strong>: POLICE have announced that a
woman, as yet unidentified, is helping them with their inquiries into
the WHITE ANGEL killings - The woman was apprehended after her finger
print was discovered on a hammer, which belonged to her - the same
hammer that was used to beat JANE MACDONALD to death last month. A brief
search of the area produced more mutilated bodies, in the garden and
bricked up in the walls of the house… The news has been met with….</p>
