<p><strong>on the movie screen</strong>: BLACK. The movie has not
started yet. After the last real trailer plays in the theater, we see
THE UNIVERSAL LOGO. The globe stops rotating, and STARTS TO BROWN AND
CRACK.</p>
<p><strong>action trailer announcer</strong>: In a world where only one
man made a difference… “n 1a%</p>
<p><strong>and we zoom all the way in to,..</strong>: A POST APOCALYPTIC
FIERY TUNDRA… AND ONE MAN…who walks across it, looking cool, shirtless,
pumped, with shades on, holding a BABY in one arm and a FLAMETHROWER in
the other. . .this is international superstar CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN…
there is a GIANT explosion behind him… he doesn’t even flinch…</p>
<p><strong>action trailer announcer</strong>: The one man who made a
difference… is about to make a difference… Again… BLACK… then Speedman,
again shirtless, is on an ICEBERG and an AVALANCHE is thundering behind
him. This time he has a SET OF TWINS AND A FLAMETHROWER.</p>

picture lists, and hailed by Roger Ebert as “A MASTERPIECE</p>
<p><strong>that will make you feel emotions you</strong>: NEVER KNEW YOU
HAD”… Three time Oscar Winner Kirk Lazarus, in two time Oscar winning
director Clint Eastwood’s boldest film… “SATAN’S ALLEY”. THE TITLE
HOLDS… then BLACK. Now, finally, the movie starts. We see The DREAMWORKS
LOGO… Which has no music under it… only the low pitched SWOOSHING OF A
CHOPPER BLADE…</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: The thumping blade gets LOUDER AND LOUDER,
the BASS LINE of “BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE” rising with it
until finally…</p>
<p><strong>inside the cobra</strong>: A GUNNER sprays fire down at
unseen anti-aircraft. All that can be see on the ground are whizzing
TRACERS flying up at the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>motown</strong>: That’s for Brooklyn, Muthafucka! Underneath
the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed out Rambo-looking Sergeant,
is letting loose his M-16 with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the
bird lower. It does. Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and
slings him over his shoulder, Brooklyn’s shirt is blown open revealing
his entrails…in shock, he clutches his liver in his right hand, and is
trying futilely to put it back in his body…</p>
<p><strong>motown</strong>: SIR! Requesting permission to disobey
Sergeant’s orders, SIR! FOUR LEAF IS</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilot</strong>: Sir! We gotta DIDI NOW! Air strike
confirmed! This place is gonna be toast in about thirty seconds! Osiris
turns on Motown, pulling his .45 in the midst of the mayhem. He pushes
it up into Motown’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>on this chopper before you join him!</strong>: Osiris,
standing on the skid, motions for the chopper pilot to take off.</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: A 1, I qft I Id Sarge… .We PUSH IN ON
BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his head. Looking off to the tree
line, he points a crooked finger…</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: It’s him. It’s Four Leaf… Everyone turns
to-see… FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN from the
“Scorcher” trailer, . burst through the treeline, half limping, half
crawling heroically through the massive firefight in SLOW MOTION. He is
being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET…CONG SOLDIERS… Everyone on board seems
mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and can’t believe his eyes… nevertheless, he
screams to the pilot. I</p>
<p><strong>go! go!</strong>: Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of
Osiris, grabs the chopper’s runner, and in a superhuman show of
strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might, preventing it
from flying away. The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats
continues his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm, providing
weak cover for Four Leaf. The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls
Fats about ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle with
the helicopter. Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is
fighting a losing battle to gain ground… He doesn’t even have a gun…</p>
<p><strong>bringing back to this bird.. .cover me!</strong>: Weak smiles
flicker across the face of the men as they do just that… unleashing lead
all around Osiris as he jumps out of the chopper like an Apache warrior.
Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his machine gun in
cool SLO MO. Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four Leaf.
Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer fire … Osiris finally
makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf, cradling his head. Four Leaf’s
eyes are glassy, and his body and arms are ripped open all over like a
rag doll.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Get outta here. I’m worm food, man, you
dig?</p>
<p><strong>osiris</strong>: What, and give up all that California pussy
you been talking about? Shiiit. Someone’s gotta show me around L.A…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Shit. . .the only way you’re gonna get a
piece of LA pussy if is you go out to the graveyard and dig some up…
Osiris looks down at Four Leaf’s now missing arms…</p>
<p><strong>osiris</strong>: Well …y…you better come along and bring the
shovel… He starts to choke up.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I’m scared,. Sarge. ‘Scared I ain’t never
gonna see another sunset. Why does a man want to pick up sticks against
another man… ’Stead of usin’ them sticks. to prop a man up? Osiris nods,
now crying like a baby… �4Id Iu I. Igft</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Hold my hands… ‘cause I got somethin’ to
say… Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf’s bloody, stringy stumps. There’s
nothing to hold…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Are, you holding them?</p>
<p>****: Oh, I’m holding them..</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I ain’t never been worth a. nothin’ in
this life, and it’s kinda late to start b e i’ a somethin’ now. But you…
you are my… b-b-brother. Four Leaf screws.up.his .face and begins to
cry–except that he can’t. He tries again… and can’t.. Hescrews up his
face grotesquely…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: You are my… WE NOW PULL BACK TO REVEAL we
are actually on location shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW
MEMBERS watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film
equipment. Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman, is
getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and. more aware of
the-crew waiting for him to cry. The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS,
is also getting uncomfortable holding Speedman’s not-crying head.</p>
<p>****: TRAILER, now he is AFRICAN AMERICAN and speaks with an The
person perhaps most upset about it all is the skinny’ young British
director, DAMIEN DORFMAN. Coiled at the monitor and covered in bug bites
and sunblock, wet towels around his neck, and clearly not made for
jungle life.. .he’ mouths the words “you are my brothers..’.” as if
trying to will the tears from Speedman’s dry eyes.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I’m sorry, can we cut, Damien? Damien
grips his headphones in confusion, looking around to his cadre of
assistants and ADs… The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to
fight, except a few are starting to wonder what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!</p>
<p>****: What? What did he say? Play it through! Still rolling! Now the
extras have stopped fighting – except for a few way far back.</p>
<p><strong>1st ad</strong>: Play it through! Still rolling!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: No! Not still rolling! Cut! Damien runs
towards Speedman. Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star JEFF
PORTNOY, gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: OW, SHIT! I fell right on my ass bone!
Other “dead” extras begin to hold their heads up and look around. Some
are amputee stuntmen.</p>
<p><strong>1st ad</strong>: Damien? Are we cutting? 1st AD jumps off the
scaffold, running towards the director. Tekkies scurry around, lots of
confusion. Are they cut, or what? Brooklyn,’.played by the not-famous
KEVIN SANDUSKY,Ihold s his bloody “liver” up to hand off to someone.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky:</strong>: Mr. Dorfman? Are we cutting sir? Cause .I
think they put w ay too much blood in my liver again.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: STILL ROLLING! Get down Kevin, you’re dead!
Sandusky immediately complies, he seems to be the only actor listening
to the director.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I’m sorry.. I can’t do it, Dorff. Damien
runs up to Speedman. They are the center of attention – the whole crew
watching them.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: It’s good, keep going. This is a big shot so
keep going, let it come. No arms, you’re hanging on, it’s-al-1-coming
out… It’s real, death, life, brotherhood and we just… let’s keep it
going now… He starts to back out, turning his finger in the “still
rolling” motion. He gives a thumbs up to the AD.</p>
<p><strong>special effects pyro control tower</strong>: CODY, the
GRIZZLED LOOKING PYROTECHNIC EFFECTS.GUY, paces in an elaborate tower
rigged with EFX detonation equipment. He is surrounded by a throng of
local ASIAN TECHNICIANS who all hold various types of buttons, and
detonators. He punches buttons, and surveys the chaos, trying to figure
out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Is that the signal?</p>
<p><strong>back on the actors</strong>: ‘IYd “’ Damien has his hands
full with Speedman.</p>
<p>****: Dorf! Seriously, I think we should cut. I mean, Should Osiris
be crying too? Maybe he shouldn’t cry if I’m crying… Lazarus abruptly
drops Speedman from his arms and gets up, shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: I’m sorry, so, just keep crying or are’we
cutting??</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: No, no, it’s good. Portnoy is walking around
massaging his butt.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Damien, I think I broke my ass. Is it
possible to break your ass?</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Get back in character Portnoy! Still rolling
everyone! Great crying Kirk – stay with that. Chris Michael, don’t worry
about where Kirk is at, just be Four Leaf crying right here and now and
still rolling… and GO!</p>
<p><strong>special effects pyro command area</strong>: Cody’s crew
buzzes around him in a countdown to Armageddon…</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Did he say “go”?</p>
<p><strong>back on’the actors</strong>: The 1st A.D. tries to.get Damien
to pay attention to Cody, but he is too focused on getting Speedman to
cry. I III I. 11h.”</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Wait, hey, y’know, maybe- is it the line?
“You are my brothers”? I don’t think I would.say that. Four Leaf
wouldn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Yes, well-you see, Four Leaf was there and
he did say that. So… Right. So let’s just go…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Is he here, or is he-’at the.hotel?
Because I would love to run it by him.</p>
<p><strong>1st ad</strong>: Damien! The chopper! I got to let them go!
We,need to pull the plug on the treeline burst if you’re cutting!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: You know what, this is nuts. You got my
take. I’m done. Movie star. We’ll be here till Chinese New Year waitin.’
for my man to. cry.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Kirk! Wait! Lazarus keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Kirk!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: .You got my take.</p>
<p><strong>,i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 13.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Hey, can we get this going? I got peeps
coming to my room to rub me down at 4. Bitches, too. His phone rings
again.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Hey! What’s up! Naw, nothing – same
soup, just re-heated, you know? Redykulous wanders off in another
direction. The AD is now yelling into Damien’s ear.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: EVERYONE! Please! The chopper only has so
much gas! PORTNOY, trying to lighten the mood, rips a huge FART.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Plenty of gas right here, D-man!</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Hey, yo! I am trying to have a
conversation here!</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Okay, fine! Fuck me! What the fuck do I
know? I’m just the fucking… Godfuckit! Damien throws his headphones off
in frustration… and throws up his hands.</p>
<p><strong>special effects tower</strong>: Cody, sees Damien throw up
his hands.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: There’s the signal! GO! GO! GO! Let’s light
this puppy up! Let’s go freaking 11 TET here!! i Cody and his assistants
push plungers, buttons, pull levers, and drag metal wands over long
lines of wired nails, they spark and fizz…</p>
<p><strong>wide shot’</strong>: Damien is-still throwing his fit
when…</p>
<p><strong>on cody</strong>: climaxing with joy as he barks commands and
pushes ever more buttons..</p>
<p><strong>the blast</strong>: blows the helicopter backwards into a
bank of lights,’ causing them to tip.and-begin a GIGANTIC CHAIN REACTION
that takes down most of the equipment, then finally THE</p>
<p><strong>tower with cody and his assistants!</strong>: Men jump like
fleas. Cody lands on his back, in pain, .which he seems to like.</p>
<p>****: That was good for me. Damien’s mouth hangs open in shock. There
is a strange quiet on the set.</p>
<p>****: .Did we get that on film? The cameraman turns to the AD and
then back to Damien, looking a bit scared.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Sorry, Damien.’Chris Michael was saying
to cut, so we cut– The AD comes up to the lost looking Damien.</p>
<p><strong>1st ad</strong>: I’m gonna have to call it, Damien. Damien is
silent, stunned.</p>
<p><strong>1st ad</strong>: Okay, that’s a wrap for’today. If you are
!IN injured, please find the set medic. Speedman, looking as if he had
nothing to do with what just happened, walks toward Damien.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I think I got another in me if you want to
go again, Damien. Damien looks at the scorched treeline behind them.
Speedman looks too, then looks back at Damien.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Your call. In the background, Cody is
casually putting out a fire on his lap. He gives an ‘I’m O.K.’ gesture
to no one in particular.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: El TELEVISION OPENING GRAPHICS After a
flashy montage, JULIE MORAN, the cute El News Daily reporter, walks
through the Tropic Thunder set in a halter top, talking to camera:</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, it might look like 1969 here in the
tiny Southeast Asian country of Bien Den Phu, but it is 2007, and they
are making history. We are here with an E! exclusive, the first look
behind the scenes at what Hollywood insiders are calling the most
expensive war movie ever produced. It’s called “Tropic Thunder”, and
first time Director Damien Dorfman has assembled an all-star cast to
play the forgotten grunts who perished near here more than 35 years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>julie .</strong>: But the last few films have-not “blown up”
for Speedntan as he’s struggled to broaden his range as an.-actor..
First, an attempt to change gears with a comedy…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The disappointing “CHITLIN AND THE DUDE”, was
followed.with last year’s failed venture into serious dramatic
territory…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: .”Simple Jack”, the story-of a mentally
impaired farm hand who can “talk” to animals was a box office disaster
that many critics called one of the worst movies of all time.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: You mu-mu-muhhh make me’ha-aaaapy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But now, the question is can Speedman “mu-
mu-make” audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf
Tayback in “Tropic Thunder”. And,’ possibly a shot „ 1. -4416 at that
elusive gold statuette?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: All I want is to make the real Four Leaf
here proud. It’s his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That’s
why we’re here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what
he– what you –went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on
the horizon for a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only
two HOOKS. Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to
“get inside” him as much as possible.</p>
<p>****: When I lost these… It was as if I saw through these for the
first time..’. And it was only then that I really began to use
these…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: That’s great. He’s like a… Buddha or
something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly
realizes Four Leaf doesn’t find it funny.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time? Maybe
you should rub Kirk Lazarus’s belly! He already has three! Speedman
laughs uncomfortably, trying to seem unperturbed. i “I’ 0, nM y</p>
<p><strong>a series of shots of kirk lazarus</strong>: In his
normal.look, CAUCASIAN and IRISH, much like he was in the “Satan’s
Alley” trailer…</p>
<p><strong>- julie</strong>: Three time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus,
reclusive, brilliant Irishman, considered by many.’the best actor of his
generation, and also a known bad boy… Stills of a DRUNKEN LAZARUS
outside a New York Bar, punching a paparazzo…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: . is famous for his total immersion into
whatever role he plays. To.transform into the role of the African
American Sergeant who saved_Four Leaf’s life…</p>
<p><strong>ajulie</strong>: Lazarus-went - to shocking, and
controversial lengths…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: After undergoing experimental pigmentation
alteration procedures in a Singapore clinic, this was the startling
result.</p>
<p>****: There are all these young brothers who got no role models but a
bunch of pimp- acting rappers, who glamorize a life of gangsterism and
womanizing. I’m just grateful to have this opportunity to be able to
represent. Redykulous hears this, looks pissed.</p>
<p><strong>series of shots of damien dorfman</strong>: Getting awards,
shooting documentary footage in SIERRA LEONE of warring tribesmen.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: British documentary director Damien Dorfman
has never made a theatrical movie before, but his mission, he says, is
to bring a reality to the film that he feels is missing from most
Hollywood epics.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: My goal, quite simply, is for an audience
member to walk out of the cinema, feeling as if they were IN Vietnam for
two hours. Quite literally.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Are you intimidated about working with
actors for the first time?</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Intimidated?</p>
<p>****: That’s intimidating. I think I ban handle actors of the unarmed
variety.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, he’ll certainly have his hands full
with king of comedy Jeff Portnoy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: After being arrested for heroin, cocaine and
crack possession, Portnoy is out to prove he can. stay clean and get
audiences addicted to seeing him in a movie without any potty.

<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: That’s why my new sports drink Pymp
Sweat is the official beverage on the set of Tropic Thunder, as well as
my new energy bar, the “Bust-A-Nut”, with all proceeds going to clean up
land mines in this previously war ravaged area.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: At a reported budget north of $200 million,
Tropic Thunder could end up costing almost as much as the real war! But
the good news for Damien Dorfman and his troops – the Oscar buzz is
already starting! So for El News I’m Julie– All of a sudden Portnoy,
wearing a Tropic Thunder cap all askew and surfer shorts with no shirt,
bursts out of the bushes. He screams wildly and GRABS Julie, who cracks
up laughing at his “stunt”. ’</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Me so horny!! Me so horny!! He jumps into
the pool with her! What a crack up!</p>
<p><strong>voice of todd</strong>: We’re shutting you down, Dorf.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: You can’t do that Todd.</p>
<p><strong>voice of todd i</strong>: Yes we can.. The dailies are not
good.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good
movie! Isn’t that what they say?</p>
<p><strong>voice of todd</strong>: I never heard that saying. Look,
Damien. Fact: You’re. three weeks behind and you’ve been shooting for
five days. Fact: we greenlit this project at a very specific number, a
number Walter and I could get in bed. with, and fact–.</p>
<p>**damien ,. _.**: Todd, it really isn’t necessary for you to,keep
saying “fact” before everything. It’s kind of implied, that if you are
saying.it–</p>
<p><strong>voice of todd</strong>: Alright.. I’m just.trying to keep the
emotion out of it, so I thought I would say.”fact” before each fact, so
it would be less-upsetting – I</p>
<p><strong>voice of walter</strong>: Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I’m
just gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a second. Dude, I mean,
46,000 dollars for Chris Michael Speedman’s masseuse’s miscellaneous
living expenses? It sounds like the inmates are running the asylum.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Well, yes, that’s exactly-it,.Walter if- you
actually came out here you would see that .these actors are–</p>
<p><strong>voice of todd</strong>: The actors didn’t blow up the
rainforest and forget to turn on the camera Damien! I have a lot of
tolerance, but when. Lt comes to nature I lose it!</p>
<p><strong>in</strong>: ► VOICE OF TODD I will not be called an
eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by
that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>hot young assistant</strong>: Sorry. It’s Chris Michael, he
says it’s important. Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony
and slides the glass door shut.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Yes, Chris!?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a
little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you’re probably
mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that’s the way these
movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of
those days. Happens.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you
have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi–</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Oh, also needed to let you know, and I.
.know you’re like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new
chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped
thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And
they stiill haven’t worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I</p>
<p><strong>damien’</strong>: Right. well those things… those. 4,</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yeah, of course, I just know we talked
about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman’s
other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Oh,, shit– can you hang on a sec, D? He
switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Rick?.</p>
<p><strong>peck.</strong>: Guess what I’m staring at right now?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: I’m looking at your ugly mug on the back of
Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly
pandas from cuteville. It’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 25. We see Pedk is holding a
Vanity Fair with an ad on the back: it is a picture of Speedman looking
earnest, holding two baby PANDAS. The caption reads:</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: The credibility factor that the pandas give
you is priceless, and strangely, if’ you see this picture, what really
strikes me is the credibility that you give them. I’ve been getting
psychotic feedback all day. Hey did you get the basket I sent?</p>
<p><strong>we see</strong>: A survival-themed gift basket in a
camouflage backpack, There’s a satellite phone, camouflage sunblock,
etc.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: You sad? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: No I’m fine. I’ve just been having a tough
time over here. They still havn’t got the TiVo hooked up and… I don’t
know… Lazarus is getting all this Oscar buzz already –</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk Lazarus
goes and places his entire body in some experimental Malaysian dipping
sauce so he can actually be black, of course he’s gonna get buzz. Listen
to what I am telling you. He is clinically mentally not right.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yeah but the way they talk about him. I
mean, he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar, I play a retarded guy
and don’t even get a nomination. I don’t know, I mean you said “Simple
Jack” would be my “Elf” but with Oscars. Those were your exact
words.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: I don’t believe those were my exact words but
let’s get beyond that to the root of this. Remember the moment you chose
to do, this’, and I wanted you to do the ESP robot thing with Wolfgang
Petersen? And I said stay home be happy and you said “no, Rick I need to
play a real human being” and I said “okay” and then I said “are you
sure?” and you said that you needed this-for your soul?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yes but –</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Which I totally respected and now you’re doing
the crazy surfer three..sixty move on me,..which I love by the-way–
but-you said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul And-that’s why I hate
you.. Because you were RIGHT. And you’re in. the Phuc Long fucking
Delta,. in the real mud, with- leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil es from
Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would wager, forcing everyone around you
to rise to your level. Am I right? I mean you are over there forcing a
bunch of PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and. become a platoon. And
it hurts. Am I right? Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yeah. You are right.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Alright, that’s what.I thought. Now get to
work genius soldier. I’ll handle the .TiVo. Peck hangs up abruptly.</p>
<p><strong>on speedman</strong>: Speedman punches the button on his
cordless and puts. it down. He ponders Rick’s words as he gets caught up
watching the end scene of “SIMPLE JACK” on his TV. He has forgotten
Damien is on the other line.</p>
<p><strong>speedman on tv</strong>: ’ Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty
sssssssunrise, uh-uh-uh-uh-ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Chris? You there? Hello? Finally, after a
few moments of listening to this, Damien explodes. He throws the phone
on the ground and jumps up and down on it. He notices the crew staring
at him. He tries to look as if that just didn’t happen. He opens the
sliding glass, and heads straight to the door. He continues walking
through his office, out into the main offices. He motions for his
assistant to join him.</p>
<p><strong>voice of todd</strong>: Damien? This is not going to go away!
I’m going to be on my cell all day – I’m going to a funeral but I’m
keeping it on. That’s Where we’re at with this!</p>
<p><strong>outside of damien’s office</strong>: He walks with purpose,
followed by his assistant.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Get everyone together! We are having a cast
meeting” tonight! No choice! Everyone must attend. I am putting my foot
down!</p>
<p><strong>hot young assistant</strong>: Oh… I don’t think I can do
that, Damien. Chris is having that “End of First Week” party at his
place tonight. Everybody’s going. Damien’s eyes twitch oddly.</p>
<p><strong>entrance to the deck</strong>: Damien walks in, watching this
scene from Caligula going down. He looks in a deep funk. Portnoy STAGE
DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with a thud in front of
Damien.</p>
<p><strong>damien,</strong>: Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to talk
– as.a cast, as a platoon, right now.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Dorfie– did you happenito see that grip
withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a-
package of mine. Kevin Sandusky comes up to them, looking fresh faced
and eager.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky.</strong>: Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was
some hit you took today.</p>
<p>****: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I’m Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin
Sandusky? I’m playing Brooklyn?</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that
grip with the bandana?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Uh, no. I think– But Portnoy is off
already looking for his drug connection. They both watch him go.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find
you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was
breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a
minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it.</p>
<p>****: You actually care, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge
opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: You’re the only one who auditioned. You’re
the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn’t
the point that we were all supposed to bond?</p>
<p>****: Yes, that was the point. Damien, grabs a drink from a passing
tray, and downs it. We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray
of food. Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a spring
roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS who is deeply
uninterested.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: r Tropic Thunder 30.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I guess I just watched some retarded
people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them… watching them..
Watching all the retarded stuff they did.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Huh, I always found mere observation a
little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt.
Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first
time in-my life.. Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at
home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn
what it was to be… .NOT retarded.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Yeah… but Simple Jack thought he was smart.
Or, rather, didn’t think he was retarded. So you can afford to play
retarded’, being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going.
there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman
is lost:</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Are you serious? Everyone knows you don’t
ever go fully retarded!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink
down. School’s in session.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man.
Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT retarded. He could count
toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT retarded. HANKS’. Forest
Gump. Slow? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: You went full retard, man. You never go 14
full retard. Don’t believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full
retard. Went home empty handed. Speedman sees this for the truth it is.
How could he be so stupid?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could be
your ticket to Oscar gold. I’d lose the hook hands though… cripples
don’t give the Academy wood either.</p>
<p>****: Oh. Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass
and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately holding the
spring,roll in his hook.</p>
<p><strong>on the other side,of the room</strong>: Damien paces the
party. He looks more miserable and high strung than ever. He discovers
Redykulous, surrounded by his posse and a CAMERA CREW.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Redykulous… I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: What up, money.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: We’re having a cast meeting, right now We
need to come together as a unit – The camera crew moves in for the
close-up. . .making Damien uncomfortable … Redykulous takes it in
stride. Throughout the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Uh-huh… Damien is made uncomfortable by
the cameraman who has i started manually zooming in and out on him in a
dutch style camera move… DAMIEN i Do you mind if we step away for a
moment?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: From what? Damien tries to indicate the
crew.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: From the…uh…you know… .this area..</p>
<p><strong>redykul:ous</strong>: Oh, I see…sure They take a few steps
away from the bar… The entire camera crew follows.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the cameras.
you understand?. Away from them…</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: No. I can’t do that. If Redykulous steps
away from the cameras then my .people don’t get to see the real
Redykulous. The show is called “Utterly Redykulous”.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Well this is about work …my show so to.
.speak. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I guess. But not really. Your show and
my show are the same thing. This is gonna help your show, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Excuse me, everyone! If I could have your
attention! Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a
couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Sorry to break up the party, but I just
wanted to call your attention to a cast meeting tonight! Big meeting!
Future of the film depends on it!</p>
<p>****: Not to mention my entire bloody life! Damien in a final cry of
frustration, SMASHES a bottle on the bar. He succeeds only in cutting
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>godfuckiti shit!</strong>: Speedman comes up, placing a
calming hook on Damien’s shoulder. He steps to the fore.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: “When… we.’.. put… aside… our…
differences… we see we’re kind of the same.” Within moments, the place
settles completely.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: “When we put aside our differences, we see
we’re kind of the same. Let’s be friends, I know we will do great things
together.”</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I was looking-at it all backwards. You
guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you, to help you gel, and
straighten.up – like a PLATOON! A long beat.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep’talk made
me.H-h-h-h-h-happy! The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman
looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really loud, and the,
place gets even crazier.</p>
<p>****: When a herd loses its way, the shepherd must kill the bull that
leads them astray.. Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is
standing eerily in the bushes by the sand.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: You don’t know which way is up, do you
private`? You couldn’t find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding
your prick. and showin’ you the way… Damien doesn’t know what the fuck
that meant. Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes. Damien’s
eyes widen in fear.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: „Tropic Thunder 35.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant
cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make
the valley, and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: If the lion, although king of the jungle,
is thrown into the sea, he will drown… but…if…</p>
<p>****: He…lives in the…water, for many years, he will.. .grow gills …
. do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>do you!?</strong>: He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the
collar with both hooks. ’</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: I want to!!! But not really!!</p>
<p>****: Someone’s an ANT? Or something???</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I put my story in your limp Brit hands
and you will not fail me!! My boys were worse pussies than these guys.
But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in
the</p>
<p><strong>shit.</strong>: He releases Damien and takes a large draw on
his cigarette…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: There’s a place. About a hundred clicks
from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no
port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the
size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his
weirdness.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Rig up your documentary cameras’in that
jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and
we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they
were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they’re
getting shot at, and you’ll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps
his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten. He holds out a
small squished mosquito’ between the claws of his prosthesis.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: You must put them.under your thumb the
way this. bug is under mine… .under YOUR control.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: I see …yes …They would ’be under my total
control… finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty.
Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Yes… yes…</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Put them in the real shit. Film them with
real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR!</p>
<p><strong>yes!!</strong>: Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look.
COOL MUSIC UP as WE PUSH IN and…</p>
<p><strong>in the chopper</strong>: Cody is piloting. Damien and Four
Leaf are in the back sitting, across from Speedman, Portnoy, Redyk and
Lazarus and Sandusky. We move across the faces of the actors, all in
brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except for Sandusky
who seems excited. Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his
agent Rick Peck.</p>
<p>****: So, uh, any idea how long we’ll be gone? Because I left most of
my… vitamins back at the hotel. The other actors chime in with similar
concerns, regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities, etc…
’</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Save your breath, maggots! They all
shrink back. Four Leaf’s fierce posture is undercut as the helicopter
lurches, sending Damien sprawling onto hire.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: That’s•right. Maggots.</p>
<p><strong>in the chopper</strong>: Damien and Four Leaf, in DI mode,
hustle the “grunts” off the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>go!!!</strong>: Apparently they are not moving fast enough –
Four Leaf and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>move! move! move!</strong>: The group, scared shitless, start
falling out of the doors of the chopper, more like a bunch of oysters
than a crack platoon. Four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and
motions to Cody, who lifts off. It kicks�up a violent backwash, 0, Iq y
forcing the guys to duck. and cover.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: See you in hell! As the noise of the
helicopter fades, the group starts. trying to orient itself in their new
surroundings.’ The Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving. All around them
can be seen the remnants of a war that has been over for thirty years. A
grave marker,. half of an old rusted out•’downed chopper. All are
absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who seems very upset.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: This is bullshit! Damien marches over to
him, and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY in the face.</p>
<p><strong>away our position to charlie!!</strong>: Silence.</p>
<p><strong>cell phones!</strong>: Everyone hands over their phones.
Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his. satellite
phone out of the gift bag. He surreptitiously stows it down the front of
his pants.</p>
<p><strong>i” ►</strong>: Damien dumps them in a pile and finds a large
boulder. HE smashes the phones with a draatic flair. The guys GROAN.
Damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Okay, girls… now that I have your attention,
I will tell you fuckfaces what we’re doing here. You are no longer
actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a war. These men around you are
your brothers. The guys look at each other, unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: Congratulations. You’ve just landed in “the
shit”. Your objective is to head north and liberate the village at D’ang
Kwook Hill, at which point “Four Leaf” gets himself captured, at which
point you rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home. We will
also be rigging this entire valley of death with hidden cameras so that
every glorious moment gets on film. And believe me it WILL be glorious.
If it looks real, chances are good it probably is. You wanted to be
actors? You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being? Get ready
to occupy the skin of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by
death, crawling up Satan’s arsehole. There’s going to be enemy fire.
Booby traps. Your own personal little slice of the ’Nam. The group
shares a look – “What’s going on?” He pulls out a laminated packet.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: “Four Leaf”, since you’re the Captain here,
here’s the scene list and the map. Think you can handle it? From now on,
Whatever we get on film is our movie, period. Damien pulls out a
walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>damien</strong>: THIS is your only link to, the real world.
It will be used only in an emergency or to replenish our supplies if
absolutely necessary. This is NOT a cell phone. This radio goes’to the
chopper, and the chopper ONLY. The chopper is GOD, and I am Jesus Christ
his SONI!! You will’ depend on and pray ‘to US!! And nobody �i�� i n I’
�IMd�4 gets home until we get the shots! Now… let’s’put the greatest war
movie ever in the can! With that, Damien marches toward the treeline
and’steps on a dormant LAND MINE left sleeping for decades.,
BLOWING’</p>
<p><strong>him to bits.</strong>: The group stands absolutely stock
still for several long beats until…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>a unknown voice</strong>: , . They lock and load, heading
towards the actors…</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 41.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: So, I’m thinkin’ as soon as Damien gives us
the go ahead, we’�ust their cherry with a few airbursts, then
alpha-alpha till they come running right at, us, then a good of
fashioned firefight, maintaining our distance. Four Leaf ignores him,
instead looking around the jungle, looking almost lost.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: I been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot. I’m
probably one-a your biggest fans. Your book was kinda my “Catcher in the
Rye”. It inspired me to become a gyro man. Four Leaf gives Cody nothing
– except his usual stoic stare.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: I’m actually sort of a war nut. I mean I never
was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of
my way of paying tribute to the real deal. And you sir, are the real
deal. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Hey, I was wonderin’ what kind of sidearm you
carry? Looks to me like a–</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I don’t know what it’s called. I just
know the sound it makes when it takes a man’s life. Cody, a little
spooked, picks up his radio.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Ok, we’re ready to rock and roll. Damien, come
in. Cameras are up, ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires and light
the fires on your say so.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: I think he’s like… dead.</p>
<p><strong>speedman:</strong>: Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice,
wherever you’re hiding!</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I don’t think he’s hiding.. I think he
just died! Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse. pulls a
wrist into frame.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: He doesn’t. have a pulse …or a head. He
then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Must’ve been one of those Claymore mines.
This old Jungle must.be full of them.,</p>
<p><strong>redykuzous</strong>: You bet your ass it is. That’s why a
percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin’ solve the problem!
Damien’s corpse emits a disturbing death rattle. Speedman busts up
laughing. They turn to him – what the hell? Speedman throws
an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent older brother.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: C’mon! Don’t you get it? This is what
.Dorf was talking about – our slice of the Nam! He’s trying to get in
our heads!</p>
<p><strong>guerrillas p.o.v – from the surrounding jungle</strong>: They
are right behind the treeline, watching the guys from about thirty
feet.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: That whole “life and death” speech in the
chopper? He’s meshing ’with us! What do you think all that “playing God”
was about? The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief – except
Lazarus.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is dead!!
Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn’t want to take sides.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Kirk. I know you’re the big fancy actor
here, but, no offense, I’ve done a lot mote effects driven event films,
and I think I can spot a prop body.</p>
<p><strong>on the guerrillas</strong>: The LEAD guerilla signals for all
his guys to hold their fire and pick their targets…</p>
<p><strong>on the actors</strong>: Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on
Damien’s body crackles to life:</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: – I repeat, we are now go for mission!</p>
<p><strong>damie–</strong>: The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman
picks it up, showing it to the guys. See?</p>
<p>****: Alright, can we start the scene now? Or do you need a formal
invitation?! Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day. Ambush.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats.
The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM
“c’mon!” type look. Portnoy doesn’t know what he means…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I said, I got a baaad feeling on this one,
Brooklyn… Oh! He’s acting! Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts
walking. stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie. Swinging
his gun unpredictably.</p>
<p><strong>on the guerillas</strong>: They are a mere ten or fifteen
feet from Sandusky on the other side of the. trees… they back off as. he
waves his gun…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Me too, cap’n.</p>
<p>****: Hey, cap?: If.I told you something, something kinda personal,
you wouldn’t think I was crazy, right?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Naw, man. I know you ain’t crazy
Brooklyn…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Well,. if I told you that I, I never
actually, well, been with a girl…you wouldn’t, like, think I was, like,
queer .or nothin’… would you.?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: .Naw, man… I wouldn’t think you was a
queer.</p>
<p><strong>,i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 45.</p>
<p><strong>i” ►</strong>: Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too:</p>
<p>****: Sh…sh…shit …When I get back to the world, I’m gonna find me the
finest piece of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it till I broke its
back.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: The last “mugambo” you ever tasted was in
your momma’s soup bowl. I wouldn’t mind slurpin’ on a little of that
–</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: That’s enough outta you Fats. Don’t you
worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and I for
one ain’t gonna let Charlie… Lazarus can’t handle it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: What the FUCK is wrong with you people?!
Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back. He addresses the
treeline.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Sorry Damien! Back to one… action! Don’t
you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED! Speedman
sighs, annoyed.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some
of us are taking this seriously. Lazarus looks likes he wants to
explode. But instead he becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive
transformation – Everything except for his skin color returns to his
real identity, a pompous Irish prick.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Jaysus! There isn’t going to be any movie,
ya gobshite!</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: i Wow. That was really cool.</p>
<p><strong>the guerillas</strong>: Are watching this, poised to
attack.</p>
<p><strong>back on the actors</strong>: Speedman and Lazarus argue, more
heated now.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped
something. He mimes picking something , off, the ground.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: It’s called your character. Don’t worry, I
won’t tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The
Guerrillas have seized the moment. The actors all immediately hit the
dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and
debris kicks up all around him.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: You happy now? We’re out of position for
the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush!
A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and
shrapnel everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I think they’re really shooting at us!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: What are you guys worried about? These
guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got
hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Come on, you guys! Let’s use this!</p>
<p><strong>on the guerrillas</strong>: Not knowing it’s only blanks, and
awed by the power of the actors’ automatic weapons, and the intensity of
their screams, they drop back…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the
radio and the explosives.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: What? I still can’t get Damien on the radio. I
bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again. What do you say we get a
little… pro-active? Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.</p>
<p><strong>back on the actors</strong>: Still fighting, oblivious that
the guerillas are about to blow them to kingdom come with RPGs. But
before the guerillas have a chance–</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: t’ Tropic Thunder 48.</p>
<p><strong>on cody</strong>: He pushes down the plunger…</p>
<p><strong>boom! boom! boom!!</strong>: Dirt flies, the guerillas don’t
know what the hell is going on =- except that someone is suddenly
bombing the shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!. Cody
turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring straight at 10 GUERILLA
FIGHTERS with their submachine guns pointed straight at them.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf
are.RIFLE BUTTED out of consciousness…</p>
<p>****: Aaaaand… CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That’s the trailer ’right
there!</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: That was some sick shit! I wasn’t even
thinking bout the camera! The guys’ adrenaline is flowing, they do high
fives all around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the jungle,
sensing that someone was out there.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky’</strong>: So what do we do now? Speedman pulls out
the map, frowns at it.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Damien said to head north. I’m guessing
they’ve got more of these “battles” and Viet Congs rigged for uls on the
way. Alright, let’s hump-our shit to D’ang Kwook! Let’s didi double
time! We got a lot of clicks to cover! Speedman heads off into a
particularly dense section of jungle. After a beat, he reappears,
looking a little lost.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Uh…Sir, isn’t it that way? Kevin points in
the other direction. Speedman glances down at the map, which he rotates
around, right side up now.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Oh yeah. Thanks, uh…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Right. Okay, To D’ang Kwook! Lets do-it-
to-it! Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly, brings up
the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A</p>
<p><strong>unseen leader</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>unseen leader.</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: So… we’re just supposed to keep
walking?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: We’ll see some action soon enough. And try
to stay in character. We’re on camera..</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: What do you mean “soon”?</p>
<p><strong>,i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 51.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Whenever Damien decides it’s time, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: When’s that?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I don’t know. That’s the whole point.
Damien wants us tired and confused.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Yeah, well I’m definitely qualifying for
those objectives. Everyone chimes in – they all need a break. Lazarus
notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Fine, fine. Okay, let’s take a break, but
be on the lookout for anything. Charlie doesn’t care if you’re on a
break or not. Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled.
Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take a leak.
Lazarus then watches him go. Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He
hears something rustle next to him.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Psst. Hey. Sandusky turns to see Lazarus
peeing uncomfortably close to him.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Speedman is watching. I don’t have much
time. I don’t really need to piss. I need to talk to you. You went to
the boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read that map?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That
hoor’s melt really thinks this is a movie. And he’s got the lot of ya
convinced.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: You saying you don’tithink they’re filming
us?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Of course not! It’s only a matter of time
before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was
shootin’, at us. That muppet’s going to get us all killed. I need to
convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can’t do it without the map.
You’re the only one who can read it. Can I count on you?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Well, yeah, I.guess. But</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show
of pretending he’s done peeing, shaking, etc.., and heads back to the
group. Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting
comfortable, begins to pee again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to
see Speedman, right next to him.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I’m gonna level with you, bro. I don’t
need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a
can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to
create a red pee.stream.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Lazarus is insane. He’s freaking out, and.
he’s gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you,
because you went to boot camp and rehearsal. And you’re pretty handy
with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>speedman-</strong>: If you stick with the program, I’m gonna
talk to some of the Dreamworks brass… there’ll probably be a Teen Choice
award in it for you. You have that potential.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the
group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: If we stay on this trajectory we should be
reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a
few groans emanating from Portnoy.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Buck up,, Fats …we got a long road ahead
of us…</p>
<p>****: No… its just that I don’t feel so hot… I left my medication at
the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Yeah, I’d like to check out some of
those “meds” for my own self. Lazarus moves up to Speedman.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a
village don’t you think we would have hit it by now?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Quit your carping, we’re right where we’re
supposed to be!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: . Hey, Is there a feckin’ river on that
map? S.pee`dman refers to the’now sopping wet map.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yes! There is! Its just a little more’
down to the… lefty-down part from the: village. Anyway,. this feels like
the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: I don’t see a “Sampan” boat!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Any second now one should come by. Alright
men, into the water! Everyone’except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the
water. They all hold their rifles above their heads.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus i</strong>: - L-et-‘-s-stop
this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We need to quit faffin’ about and turn.
around NOW! And… Lazarus grabs Sandusky.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Sandusky agrees. with me. Don’t you,
Sandusky? Kevin is caught, not sure what to d</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Wait! First of all… Now Speedman grabs
him.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Kelvin believes in this movie. And,
second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves, a
pretty shite one. The actors react – Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman
steels’ himself.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: THAT’S THE WAY OUT! That’s our only
chance!</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until
they send help! Or maybe try to get back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Help from where! Need I remind you that
Damien’s orders were to – –stay in character. Now, I already have an
international box office presence, but for some of you, I’m guessing you
might not want to screw this movie up! This actually seems to affect the
actors. Lazarus can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: .okay…C’mon, boys! This way. Let’s go get
those Viet Congs! Lazarus throws down his gun. He’s had it.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Jay-sus Fuck! It’s Viet Cona! Not Viet
Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey, if you’re so sure of yourself,
why don’t you let Kelvin have a look at the map?! Kevin doesn’t know
what to do – he doesn’t want to get in the middle of this. Speedman
continues to be the tough guy.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Be my guest. Speedman hands over the soggy
map. Kevin looks. After a long beat…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: We’ve been going the wrong way. ’We were
supposed to be doing this: Sandusky traces his finger along the correct
route – a clearly marked, northward arrow.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: instead, we did this. i I �1d Iv I. 11M%
Sandusky draws a line due East –..into a. section of the. map clearly
marked with scary skull and cross-bone type 14 % warnings.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Oh, man, this is not’ cool, this is not
cool at all. Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I can’t believe you people!. You’re
pussing out on me? We are supposed to be a unit!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: No one is “pussing out.” They just prefer
not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can you get’us back to the landing zone
without the map?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: It might be tricky, but maybe.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin’ war
with Mister Box Office? Or staying alive?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna
abandon this movie? A long tense. beat – finally, Sandusky walks towards
Lazarus. Everyone follows him. Speedman looks stunned. After a moment,
he shakes his head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle with
both hands over his head.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: So that’s the way it,,is, huh? Fine! I’ll
finish the movie alone!</p>
<p>****: And when I give my acceptance speech, I’ll be sure to thank
you, Lazarus, for staying out of that scene. And come Oscar night, we’ll
see who feels a little “full retard”! He reaches the other side of the
river.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Chris, You have no idea where you’re
going!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yeah, I do! I’m going to “EX’S. JUNGLE.
DUSK. FOUR LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE”. And, I can shoot it alone.
They’watch him trudge into the foliage. U2’S “BULLET THE BLUE SKY” comes
up as the men watch Speedman disappear…</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: Speedman walks through the scary jungle,
exhausted. He is tired, lonely and hungry. The jungle is making all
sorts of terrifying noises. Finally he stops and regards the
treeline.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: DORF!…CODY?!…What’s the deal with a meal
break? Are they gonna chopper stuff in later on? I don’t wanna be a
prima donna or anything, but, we gotta eat, right?</p>
<p>****: Damien?</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Uhhh… .UHHHHHHHH.</p>
<p>****: Ohhhhh-Maaaaaaannn…I’m cold. It’s</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Ohhh GOD! Is’anybody BOILING!? It’s like a
sweat lodge out here!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly,
Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have
suffered for art. A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all
over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy
looks a little hurt.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: You know what? I think I actually liked
you better when you were a nigga.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: You know, Redykulous’, I respect what it is
you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking – invented by the Irish I might
add.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: “Why”?! I dunno…maybe because they had
one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white
guy.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Oh…I see…Put another way – you’re mad
because I can act “black” better than you can.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Take it easy guys…</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: You better rein in ‘black like me’ over
here, before I put a foot in his white ass…</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is
truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight.
Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks
Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Okay! That’s enough! Jesus Christ! It’s
not enough we have people shooting at us! Now we have to kill each
other?! Let’s pull it together! This place is full of land mines! Or
doesn’t anyone’s sense memory recall our director being blown up by
onel? That shut them up.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Sandusky is right… we could all learn a
little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style,
footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks
off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front.
Sandusky gives him a look.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Your bravery shames us. Sandusky
reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the
branch. The guys follow at a VERY safe distance. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT AM
l u I, I nhy CLOSE. ON Speedman’s face. After a beat.a drop of water
hits him in the.forehead. Then another. PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic
shelter made. out of headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.’ The
drip-is now becoming full on RAIN. He clutches an Equal packet and. the
Cherry Chapstick. Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a
tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He then tears open
the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,.and takes. a
lick, savoring every granule. He hears a rustling in the bushes across
from him. A rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and
begins to stalk his prey. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a
flash of. fur… Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness,
and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is heard…</p>
<p><strong>quick shots of: fangs, blood, an eyeball, a huge
paw…</strong>: Speedman is slashed, SOMETHING has got him in a choke
hold… He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally pummeling
his attacker. He is. covered in blood, but looks ecstatic.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die!
Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal VICTORY SCREAM.
Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: A.small, cute, cuddly
PANDA… Speedman looks horrified…</p>
<p><strong>i” 1</strong>: FLASH on a SERIES OF STILLS from SPEEDMAN’S
PANDA PHOTO</p>
<p><strong>shoot…</strong>: He stumbles back against a tree. Suddenly we
hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and - frantically jams his hands
in his pants it is the forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back
when.</p>
<p><strong>close on phone – caller id says “rick peck”</strong>:
Speedman answers…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu’s
ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly
to your bedroom. But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey
brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper.</p>
<p>****: I killed one rick. The thing I love more than anything in the
world…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: A hooker? You killed a hooker? Calm down, it’s
fine. This is a no-brainer. Thank GOD you’re out of the country.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: No! A Panda! I killed a panda!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You WHAT? Uhy. Heavy shit National Park. Oh
jeesus…take a breath.. .did anybody see you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Chill zone, buddy, 1im thinking. Did anyone
see you do this?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: I don’t think so. I’m out in.the bush.
Alone.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Alright. Listen to me. I want.you to.get your
hands on some-bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and some lime. Your gonna
wanna cut the body in quarters … the femurs are gonna be a bitch… that’s
normal… Speedman’nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a</p>
<p><strong>piano. wire being slipped around his neck…</strong>:
Suddenly, he’is being choked.-He drops the phone, gasping for.air…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Chris? Breathe.! It’s gonna be ok.. I’m
calling that publicist right now, the one J Lo hired when she
was’hammered and killed that kid with her Jetski. A guerilla shoots the
phone. They quickly tie Speedman.up and whisk him’off into the
jungle.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it on
Dorf.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: In a detention hut. And they got
Speedman…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf’s p.o.v. –</strong>: A guard shoves Speedman hard
with a rifle butt. Speedman over “acts” the pain.</p>
<p><strong>back on cody and four leaf</strong>: Cody gets up, starting
to freak out</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: What? Why? We gotta get outta here! Are they
gonna kill us? Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his
hooks.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Pull it together private! Shut your trap
before you get us killed! You understand me , lilydick? ! Cody backs
off, still scared.</p>
<p><strong>byong</strong>: What were you doing in our poppy fields?</p>
<p>****: Poppy fields?</p>
<p><strong>byong</strong>: Who sent you here?</p>
<p>****: Corporal Four Leaf Tayback…Serial number 694529987.</p>
<p>****: Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing. a little easier?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: You bastard.</p>
<p><strong>byong</strong>: What? just thought you might like. some…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh. yeah.
. .THIS is from my uncle… SAM! He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending
him reeling into the back wall. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: May God protect you from the mighty arm of
the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My men will seek you out and mete.
out a cruel justice!- Byong and the guards look at him, a bit
confused.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I think he’s dead. A wet fart seeps out of
Portnoy.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: No. Just smells like hens dead.
Smelled</p>
<p><strong>44m</strong>: like that all night.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p>****: Nothing! Probably just the beginning stages of some … .
kinda…jungle fever. More bad noises.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: If we can work out some rig to carry m�? I
think it might subside in a little bit… No one touches him.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at
him. Is he serious?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry
Portnoy. God help you. He marches off.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: God help me?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: God help him that bitch ever find his
blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world. Redykulous
and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up Portnoy on a make shift
stretcher.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Look! From behind, Sandusky grabs him
and forces him to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: SHH! Everybody down! The guys hit the
dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them. He pulls out his binoculars, and
surveys the scene.</p>
<p><strong>binocular pov</strong>: It is the Flaming Dragon
compound…</p>
<p><strong>” lazarus</strong>: Fook me! I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>-sandusky</strong>: Knew what?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: “EXT. P.O.W. PRISON CAMP – DAY”! Oranges
and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements. Speedman was right. We ’are
shooting the movie. Sandusky grabs the binoculars and
starts’looking…</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: , How could I be so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I don’t think so… . looks to me like some
sort of heroin processing plant. Look at the cooking vats, and the
guards. Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: How do you know all,this?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: It was a long trip. I read the in-flight
magazine. We’re in the Golden Triangle, the biggest drug producer in the
world. Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>binocular pov</strong>: It is SPEEDMAN, who is being dipped
in and out of the water in his bamboo cage, while a bunch of guards
stand around and laugh. Whenever he comes up for air, he is</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: It doesn’t look good. Lazarus grabs the
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Sweet Mother of Jaysus. Suddenly: GUNFIRE
ERUPTS ALL AROUND! A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running
at them, firing automatic weapons… The guys scream, and start a frantic
retreat down the hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of
his stretcher for dear life… In fact, he is actually beating them down
the hill.. .when suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!</p>
<p><strong>help! guys! wait!</strong>: REDYKULOUS stops and turns around
and runs back to him, heroically pulling him out. BUT…</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?! He screams
in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears into the’hole. REDYKULOUS
whistles for the guys to join him, and they all pile into the hole.</p>
<p><strong>in, the hole</strong>: Totally black… . they huddle, trying
to muffle their heavy breathing…</p>
<p><strong>above. the hole</strong>: The guerillas all frantically look
around for the guys. No sign of them. One of them signals for them to
keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>hole</strong>: Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area.
Sandusky lights a match. Portnoy is weeping in pain.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Must be one of those underground tunnels.
The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f must have found one of the
entrances,:. Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: My ass…I think I took one in the ass…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Lemme see… Sandusky rolls him.over, and
off camera, helps him remove his pants… All the guys recoil in
horror.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: How did it get infected so fast? More ad
libs of disgust…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky’</strong>: Okay Jeff…This is gonna hurt like hell,
but I have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if I can
dig it out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his hand… Beat… Sandusky
puts his hand off camera.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it out!
That’s not the bullet hole. The bullet hole is over here! It dawns on
the guys that they have NOT been looking at the bullet hole. Ad-libs of
even MORE disgust.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You’re
gonna be fine.</p>
<p>****: Uhhh..I don’t think I got the new pages…</p>
<p><strong>your compatriots!.</strong>: Tran points across the courtyard
where… A”4 Iv I. InM y CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks
scared out. of his mind. Speedman takes this in. Traci nods, and TWO
GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran
gets out his own stick and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: No! Puh-Puh-pulease don’t h-h-h-hurt them…
I Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He signals.for
the guards to stop beating the others. A long beat.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Say that. again.,</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Please don’t hurt them?I</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: No…like you did before! Silence.</p>
<p><strong>say it!</strong>: He threatens to hit him, Speedman
recoils.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Puh-puh-puhlease don’t h-h-hurt them? A
hush falls over the crowd. Tran’seyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>tran’s entourage</strong>: Nyam nook snep jawk…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Please! Excuse me, What are you
saying?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Nyam nook snep Jawk! You are Simple Jack?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: What? You.. You saw Simple Jack?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: We love the tale of this man, Simple Jack.
Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a battered VHS
BOX OF SIMPLE JACK. Speedman looks lovingly at it.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: We do not have many luxury here. Simple Jack
is the only movie we possess. We have watched it many, many times. How
is the word? Genius? Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It’s a
small world after all.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: You should have got Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Thanks. I mean even just the
nomination…</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: You were nominated?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: No, I mean it is great to.be nominated,..
if you are, or that’s what I hear. Whatever. It’s a popularity contest.
It’s totally political, you have to lobby for like a year for it…</p>
<p><strong>tram</strong>: SHUT UP NOW. ilia i n nMd</p>
<p>****: My apologies for almost.beating you to death before.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: No problem. So are you going to let me
go?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: No. We will hold.you,for ransom.–.much more
money now.. He pulls out a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>tram</strong>: Is it possible to.have picture?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Oh, sure, absolutely. Speedman tries to
throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs the arm., and twists it back.
Speedman shrieks in pain.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: You mustn’t touch me. The guard snaps the
picture.</p>
<p><strong>abodyguard</strong>: That came out really good.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Now, do the movie.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Do the movie.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: The whole movie?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Yes. Begin.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Hey, I know you’re big fans and that’s</p>
<p><strong>great–</strong>: Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a
rifle butt. Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers.</p>
<p><strong>ow!!</strong>: Tran stands over him, screaming into his
face:</p>
<p><strong>swine!1</strong>: Speedman gets up, begins a scared,
unenthusiastic</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Aww, puh-puh-Pa! Whu-why you guh-got to
muh-muh-make ffffffun of me?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: More stupid!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Awww, puh-puh-paaaa… Tran turns to one of
his men</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Get him some overalls! And give him the Simple
Jack haircut!</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: It looks clear, but I can’t be sure. I say
we stay in here till it’s dark.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I can’t believe this is how it ends for
Redykulous. I’m a triple platinum recording artist., Shit.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: I gotta get back to the hotel. I’m not
gonna make.it…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Forget it. That guard patrol knows we’re
out’here. They’ll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman’s in that
compound. And no one else knows but us.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: That’s right. So here’s the plan. Everyone
leans forward expectantly.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: We sneak out of here, make our way back to
the hotel and once we’re safe, we alert the government of Speedman’s
situation.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Whoa whoa whoa … . wait! So, we’re just
gonna leave him here?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Yeah, and I don’t wanna spend another
minute getting the full on smell’o vision in this hole with his stinky
ass. Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks horrified.
SANDUSKY Au II4 WAIT! Look, I don’t think I’ve met a more wildly self
involved human than Speedman, but you’re just gonna leave him here? I
mean, come on. He’s a person, guys. These drug lords are killers. I
mean, they eat their enemies. We leave him alone now, he doesn’t have a
chance in hell.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus,</strong>: That tosser is in there because of his own
stupidity. As far as I’m concerned, he brought it on himself.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Besides, how could we possibly rescue
him? Get real, Sandusky, we don’t know what the fuck we doing out
here.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: We’ve gotten this far. Look, we’re making
a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever. It’s a true story,,
right? I mean, those guys weren’t superheroes! They were just put in
extra-ordinary circumstances, and they rose to the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Yeah, but they were trained soldiers. They
knew how to take care of themselves.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: And we don’t? They believed they could do
it. They believed in each other. Look, I’m not saying it’s gonna be
easy.</p>
<p>****: I mean, some of us might not come back.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: You mean, like, not on the same flight?
Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what he meant.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Jeff – I know this is really hard for
you,.•but you’re gonna have to kick some time, and it might as well be
now. Kirk, I’ve always admired you as an actor. But as a person, I have
to say, not that impressive.’ You got a.few Oscars. Got any balls?
Lazarus takes this in.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good
game, but how’s it gonna feel when you’re sipping Cristalle with your
homies.in the hot tub back in.Cali knowing you left.a man to die back
here? You gonna rhyme about that? , There is a long beat.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Shit. I only wish they was filming this
for my show. I’m in. He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic
pause.. Then…</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: We could fooster about for donkey’s
years..Let:’s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller. The guys
look at each other. What did that mean?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus.</strong>: I’m in!</p>
<p><strong>hot young assistant</strong>: Chris Michael is on the
line.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Chris? What is this craziness?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Hi, Rick. It’s Chris–</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Chris?</p>
<p><strong>byon g</strong>: Yes, that was Chris. But you will not speak
with him again. And do not bother trying to trace this call.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What’s going on? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>byong</strong>: We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with us
now. There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he nods
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your little
agency. But if you wanna poach my client? Lemme tell you something. His
career’s been in a death spiral since Simple Jack, so why don’t you all
go fuck yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn’t even told you about the
whole panda thing! He killed a panda! And next time you’re at a cocktail
party with Paris Hilton, or at Kate Mantellini’s choking down some egg
whites with Ron Howard, DON’T LET THAT SLIP, because chances are, I
ALREADY DID! Rick slams the phone down.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 78.</p>
<p><strong>binocular pov.– flaming dragon courtyard</strong>: Speedman
is acting like Simple Jack, with his new bad haircut.,He is performing
for a small group, of chuckling. GUARpS.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Jaysus! We’re too late. They brained him!
REDYKULOUS grabs the binoculars. Sees for himself.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: He’s right, man, that ain’t right.
Messin’ with a man’s brain.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: We gotta get him outta there…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky’</strong>: Here’s us. Here’s the compound.Here’s
where Speedman was. It looks like they move him at night, cause he’s not
here now. Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place
is.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: I got an idea. Everyone turns to
Portnoy.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: It might be a little crazy, but…</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Crazy is better than nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Back in ‘98, I did a low budget titty
comedy for skinemax, “Sex Camp”. Anyway, me and the campers from the
uncool camp had to break into the rich girls’ camp. So we did it by
building a catapult. They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down.
The guys all look at each other… then finally:</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That’s lame. I say we
wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances.
You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Good. Then let’s get some rest. Me and
Redyk are on first watch. I’ll wake you in two hours, and we’ll switch.
They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 80.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: I’m not gonna make it.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Yes you are.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Then you gotta tie me up. I’m serious. Tie
me to a tree. No matter how much I scream, or however much-I plead,
you.must not untie me. I will be cunning, I will be in pain, and Iwill
lie. The devil works this way. I will say, do, and excrete many
regrettable things. But.no matter what.. .you must leave me alone.
Beat..</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him
up. We’ll get you through it.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Jack…I could never go -to the county ho-
down with you. I would be laughed out of town. And what would Chet say?
The bodyguards laugh woodenly at Speedman.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: B-b-b-b-but I am a G-g-g-ggggoood Dd-d-d-
d-dancer. Speedman bows, exhausted and exhilarated. The old women
.politely applaud. A new group forms in front of his cage. Speedman
stands. He sighs, and begins the movie over again…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty sssssssunrise,
uh-uh-uh-uh-ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Go do your chores, slowpoke!!</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: That poor bastard. Looks like they coo-
coo nested him.</p>
<p>****: So what’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: What plan?</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: To get us out of here? Come on man, yoi4 lived
this, you gotta have an idea of how we can get out of here? Right? Four
Leaf looks a little at a loss…</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Sometimes the flowing stream can only
move when… the water… dries up.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: No offense, but what the hell does that
mean?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: It means I’m,sick of your yappin’!</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Come on man, you heard him back there. They
wanna off us! We gotta escape! You</p>
<p><strong>gotta–</strong>: Four Leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right
up to Cody’s neck. Cody instinctively blocks it with his hand.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I gotta what? Take on the whole compound
by myself!</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Stop it man! You’re chokin’ me!</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: AHH! Who the hell are you? Four Leaf looks
down, sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Wow… .look at all those stars. Makes a guy
feel pretty small.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Back in LA, we don’t get stars like this.
I wonder why there are so many here?</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Ohhhh…jeeesssusss..it’s horrrrible.:…</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Man, how can;, you be talking about
stars? We might not make it outta here tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I don’t know. I give us pretty good odds.
Redykulous looks at’his watch, and lets out a chuckle.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Nothin’..</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: .I can’t feel my legs!…</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I’m just thinking about Lill
Kantankerous Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: She’s a rapper I’m producing, a twelve
year old girl. Her first single drops tomorrow and I’m not even gonna be
there to see it.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Ohhhhh GOD! THERE’S BARBED WIRE IN MY</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I pulled her off the streets six months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: You did that?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Well, not literally, she was trapped in
a dead end record deal with Rick Rubin. Didn’t even have a lawyer. Huh.
And here I am on the other side of the world. About to die for a guy I
barely even know. Makes Redykulous wonder what’s it all about.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to
think about.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: You single?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Yeah,… .I guess. I dunno. I got a girl.
But it’s not too serious.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I don’t think we’re in love.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Ohh… . thank God…its Over …it’s finally
over…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky:</strong>: It’.s kind of depressing. That feeling of
not having anyone who really loves you.. Redykuloils. puts his arm
around Sandusky to comfort him..</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Hey, it’s cool.. I think you’re
extremely lovable. Weird silence.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I mean like …like,. I know what you
mean. I have love problems myself!</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: .No you don’t. What would the great
Redykulous, know about Girl Problems. You’re ten girls deep 24 hours a
day!</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: .That’s the problem. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: OHH GOOD!!!1 make it stop! …
.Pahllleeeeeese!</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Jeesus, I can’t believe I’m gonna tell
you this… Beat.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I’m… .I like guys.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: What? But…</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Ohh…phew…</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I know-impossible huh. That’s what I say
sometimes, but its true. Talk abort living a loveless life. At least you
have someone who loves you. I don’t even have that.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: When I think of the nights, alone in my
penthouse, when I’ve longed for the gentle touch of another dude, to
feel his skin against mine, or his sweet breath on my face.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: All this from the same guy who
wrote”Niggaz Gotta Bust a Nut on a Ho”.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Yeah, well, let me let you in on a big
secret.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: So what! You’re gay! You’re also a great
artist and-businessman … why not rap about that? �u I° I. 11�jm</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Yeah right. And watch my clothing line,
e4� sports drink,jewelry, nutrition, bars, and fragrances go south? It’s
all such a lie. Now he begins to cry .a. little. Sandusky embraces
him.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky.</strong>: Shhh…shhh… .shhh..shhh..shhh… .That’s
it…let it out.</p>
<p>****: If you tell anyone I’ll have someone shoot your. ass.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I’m not gonna tell anyone, and your not
gonna shoot me… .th-at’s it…l-et -tout. Redykulous pulls back, and
collects himself.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Aww shit… I can’t. believe it’s possibly
the last day of my life, and I’m not even gonna be able to let my fans
know how truly ’Utterly Redykulous I really am.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Listen, I know how utterly Redykulous you
are. Even for just.thisone moment. . .and sometimes that enough.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 87.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Thanks man.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: So all of “Tropic Thunder” is bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it
happened!</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Are you even a VET!?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: YES! Well …no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not
exactly. I served honorably in what they called the “forced service”.
Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: So you were some two bit criminal who got
caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU
MAN!</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a
fuckup, sure, but one day as I was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass
big- wig, I came across a file headed for the shredder marked top
secret. It was Four Leaf Tayback’s file. A nobody. No family. Nothing.
Killed in Action. They were gonna bury the whole thing. Total black
op.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: So you decided to take his identity?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story And
I gave the American people a hero! Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf,
but if I didn’t pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he
was! See what I’m sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: And you cashed in!</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy
had a story worth-telling, and nobody woulda ever known! Cody slumps in
the corner, looking spent and lost.</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I’m sorry, man.. I’m responsible: for
this .whole mess.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: I’m clean! I’M CLEAN!!!!! He struggles to
his feet, doing a celebratory dance. He immediately gets nauseous again
and heaves.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: My ’ life .be_gins today!</p>
<p><strong>close on the flaming dragon insignia</strong>: Pull back to
reveal that it is on a piece of paper being pulled from a fax machine.
The text below reads: “Flamingg. Dragon has Speedman.lfyou want him, the
price is $5O Million.” There’s a phone number below it. Reveal we’re
in…</p>
<p><strong>hot young assistant</strong>: Rick, you better check your
email. He punches up his email. He opens a video attachment. We</p>
<p><strong>on rick’s computer</strong>: A bad quality video of Speedman
sitting in the interrogation room.</p>
<p><strong>byong</strong>: Mr. Rick Peck. So far you have refused to
give us the respect we asked for. Maybe this will change your mind.
Please state your name.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Chris Michael Speedman.</p>
<p><strong>byong</strong>: Who do you work for, Mr. Speedman?</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Well, I guess that really varies from
project to project– Byong SCREAMS at Speedman, who cowers. Even Rick
flinches.</p>
<p><strong>tram</strong>: Wrong answer!! You work for me now!! Do you
understand! Like my desk or my gun, you are mine and you exist for
me!!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Yes! I work for you!</p>
<p>****: He really knows how to handle a client. He hands the assistant
the fax.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Get this yutzle on the phone. Now.</p>
<p><strong>byong</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I saw your ’little fax, Flaming Fuckwads. I
bet you thought I was just. going to lie here and take it. Well, wrong!
My name is Rick Peck, not Rick Shaw,..and you are not gonna take me.for
a ride, you industrious fuck; I don’t care who you people think you are,
but I am coming. there, and I am going to jack you up! I am bringing the
heavy artillery, my friend, so you’d better be prepared for a blood
bath.! I am walking out of there with Chris Speedman whether you, or he,
likes it or.not! Rick slams down the phone, enjoying himself.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Shandra, get tech support to put a trace on
this email attachment, let’s find out where this “Flaming Dragon” agency
is! Call the travel department. See if they got a nonstop to
Bien-Ben-Wherever-the fuck-it-is!</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: This is it. You know what you need to do.’
Tropic Thunder on three, two, one…</p>
<p><strong>tropic thunder!</strong>: They make their way down the
hill.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky i 4i4</strong>: FAN OUT! ’GO ROOM BY ROOM ! IF YOU
SEE, nci 16, SPEEDMAN, give the signal! We follow PORTNOY, working his
wayldown a hall. He peaks around a half opened door…</p>
<p><strong>a darkened room</strong>: .PORTNOY turns on his flashlight to
reveal he is in fact in… HEROIN HEAVEN! Wall to wall packets, ready,for
shipment.. PORTNOY is paralyzed. He spots a box with the words “For
U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting”. His mouth LITERALLY waters,
and’a drop. of .spittle oozes from his bottom lip. He doesn’t know what
to do. He gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box. marked
“pure”. It’s like holding two grenades…</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He
kicks it’open to reveal…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits
bolt upright.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I’ll be
right back! Sandusky runs off to get the guys.</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus,
points to both of his eyes, signalling that he’s got “eyes”,on Speedman.
They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops them, and makes a
made up, absurd signal for “Where is Portnoy?”, somehow trying to mime
looking for a fat guy. No one knbws what he is doing.</p>
<p>****: Where is Portnoy?!</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Shhh! A muffled, anguished animal noise
that could only be PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards
it. Redykulous kicks it in.</p>
<p><strong>heroin heaven</strong>: The ’gang flies in, to discover
Portnoy holding the bags, crying.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: What are you doing, man!</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Come on, let’s go! We found Speedmani</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: I don’t care! It doesn’t matter what I do!
I’ll always be a screw-up! No one will ever respect me…</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: That’s not true! Listen, back in the
day, I used to think I couldn’t produce a record simply because…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: .he’s gay. Uh-oh. That’s not what
Redykulous was about to say. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Actually I was going to say poor.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Tropic Thunder 94.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Listen.. .Don’t be crazy Portnoy –you’re
not a fuck up. You’make millions of people laugh!</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: You said my farts made them laugh! Leave me
ALONE!!</p>
<p><strong>redykulous.,</strong>: That ain’t true Portnoy! Lotta people
be fartin’ and not be gettin’ 20 large a pop for it!</p>
<p><strong>outside the door</strong>: .TWO GUARDS hear the noises
inside, head. in to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>heroin room</strong>: The guys hear the guards enter the far
side of the room. They can’t see the guys through the.shelves packed
with heroin packets.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Damnit! We need to go!</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: No, I can’t do it. I need it! I need it!!
This’is all I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Come on, man… And.the guards emerge.
around a corner! They jab their rifles.at:the guys and SCREAM AT THEM TO
PUT THEIR HANDS</p>
<p><strong>up!</strong>: The guys all slowly raise their hands… Then, in
a moment of craziness, PORTNOY CHARGES THE</p>
<p><strong>laugh at that!! laugh at that bastard!!</strong>: The guards
let off a BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as Portnoy grinds it into their
noses…</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Something’s happening! Get me the
hooks!</p>
<p><strong>heroin room</strong>: Portnoy watches as the white faced
guards fall to their knees, choking and groggy. After a beat, they
collapse.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Let’s move! We got about sixteen hours
before they wake up! They run out.</p>
<p><strong>speedman’s cell</strong>: The guys run in. Redykulous breaks
the lock off Speedman’s ankle with his rifle butt. Sandusky keeps watch
by the door.,</p>
<p><strong>redykulous,</strong>: C’mon! We’re busting you out!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks
call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: I think he thinks he’s Simple Jack. Like
from the movie?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus’</strong>: Shite. I was afraid of this. The same
thing happened to me when I played Neil Armstrong in “Moonshot”. They
found me in an alley in Burbank re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere in an
old refrigerator box.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: I heard that movie was good.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Can you fix him?!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: I’ll try. Lazarus takes Speedman’s face in
his hands, forces him to look at him.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: .You’re Chris Michael Speedman!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Ah 1-1-likes pie.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: You’re the greatest star in the world!
There’s a flicker of intelligence in Speedman’s eyes. It passes.</p>
<p><strong>e-x-t . de-t-en-t-ion-hu-t—-dawn-</strong>: They emerge into
the chaos. IT IS DAYLIGHT NOW. A GUARD runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook
to trip him up. Cody knocks him out and grabs his machine gun. He tosses
the guard’s pistol to Four Leaf.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: By the way, what’s your name anyway?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Marvin Kaminsky.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: you ever been in this jungle?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Nope. First time outta the states
actually. He shoots off a round and they run for cover.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: The world needs you! It` needs its stars!
You make people forget how awful and 1� I Ii I. 1 ,14M depressing their
lives are! People love your work! And… I love your work, too. Speedman
is quiet.</p>
<p><strong>speedman i</strong>: Uhhhh-uh-I’m… Spah-speeedman?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Simple Jack was magnificent!</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Is it working?</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I’m not re-
programming a VCR!! You really committed yourself. And for that you
DESERVED AN OSCAR! Speedman registers this.</p>
<p><strong>you are!</strong>: Lazarus’s own words make him stop and
think.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: You know who you are… . you do Chris. Long
beat.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Unlike me. What am I doing? I can’t do
this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can’t
even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and
begins to break down.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: Yo, c’mon, man! Why is everybody
gettin’. so insecure alla a sudden?! You’re Kirk Lazarus! You’re like
the greatest actor in the motherfuckin’ world!</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Guys, let’s go, we gotta get outta here! I
it I. 11h.4%</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Am I Redykulous? … AM I!…Or.am I just
acting like that’s who I am? No. The sad fact is… I’m not Sergeant
Osiris. . .or Father O’Malley …or’ Neil .Armstrong. I’m not even .Kirk
Lazarus. I have no idea who I am. The guys look at him… it’s the first
time he has let his guard down.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Kirk, this is NOT the time!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: And I guess when you-do themath… .and boil
it all down, I’ve invented myself so many times… .became so many people…
.that at the end of the.day…I’m</p>
<p><strong>redykulousi</strong>: Bull-s-hit! Y-ou-l-isten to-me
.-.-Y-ou-a-r-e-who you want to be, and you-have to OWN. THAT! Look at
me! I’m GAY and, I’m proud! He winks at Sandusky.</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: That’s right! We’re.not what we’re
called, or who we pretend to be. We are what we are in our hearts. And
to me, looking into your heart, you’re a hero.. Lazarus looks to
Redykulous.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: You mean that?</p>
<p><strong>redykulous</strong>: .Yup.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: And I’ll second that. They all’turn to
see…SPEEDMAN. The million-dollar smile is back!</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Now let’s get the hell outta here!
Speedman leads the men to the door. Sandusky tosses Speedman’a machine
gun.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Thanks Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: My name…you remembered my name. You gotta
show us the way outta here Chris.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Follow me. This time they do…</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: The guys run toward the opening to the
courtyard, Speedman leading the way…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: That’s their supply chopper.</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: If we could create a diversion, we could
get to that jeep and drive it right over there…</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: “Ttopic Thunder 100.</p>
<p><strong>portnoy</strong>: Anybody here know how to fly a helicopter?
Cause that would come in, handy too.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: You want a diversion? I’ll give you a
diversion. Is this baby loaded? He holds up the machine gun…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Yeah, but… And with’that, Speedman runs
out in to the courtyard,.. the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a
CRAZY WAR’</p>
<p><strong>whoop…</strong>: A BUNCH OF GUARDS turns to,see.him… he does
a-SUPER MACHO TUCK AND ROLL, landing perfectly and EMPTYING HIS</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: .they’re blanks… There is a long moment of
silence as the guards just stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised
that. they are not dead,. as do the guards themselves. They cock their
weapons, about to shoot him when.,.. A HAIL OF-BULLET
FIRE-erupts-behind-the-gu-ards… They turn…WE REVEAL CODY AND FOUR LEAF
BEHIND THEM, THEIR</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Let’s move! The.guys jump into the jeep,
Sandusky at the wheel, and ’gun it..</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Chris, come.on! Speedman jumps. into the
jeep as it passes by. They are speeding toward the helipad.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Four Leaf! Effects guy! Come on!!</p>
<p><strong>we gotta get them, go around!!</strong>: Sandusky swings the
wheel hard. . .the jeep careens back toward the firefight…they come in
hard, and SKID TO A</p>
<p><strong>stop next to four leaf and cqdy..1.</strong>: Cody jumps in
the jeep, but FOUR LEAF DOESN’T…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Get in the Jeep!</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: You go… I got real bullets! I’ll cover
you.. It’s the only way you’ll make it!</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Marvin, you gotta –</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Just go!! Sandusky looks at Speedman…
they both know he’s right. They go… leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still
firing… The jeep speeds up to the helipad… the guys jump out. Just as
the last guy is out…</p>
<p><strong>boom! a huge blast flips the jeep into the air…</strong>:
Across the courtyard is TRAN… who just fired an RPG at our guys! The
guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the chopper… Sandusky
pushes Cody in…</p>
<p><strong>sandusky</strong>: Start the chopper now Cody! Cody nods,
getting his bearings… and hitting the ignition…the BLADES SLOWLY HUM TO
LIFE, BEGINNING TO TURN… Portnoy grabs Cody’s gun and hangs by the
runner, shooting towards approaching guards…</p>
<p><strong>the opening of the movie:</strong>: Tran is reloading his
RPG…</p>
<p><strong>now!! do it cody!!</strong>: Cody reluctantly pulls up the
throttle. The chopper. begins to LIFT OFF…</p>
<p><strong>i’m trying!!</strong>: Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is
genuinely having trouble getting in.-the chopper. But then Speedman sees
something…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: It’s him…</p>
<p><strong>speedman’s pov</strong>: FOUR LEAF… much-like.Speedman
playing him in the beginning of the. movie… Arms extended, his body
riddled with bullets…</p>
<p><strong>foock!</strong>: Cody lowers the chopper … Speedman jumps
out…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Cover me! Speedman runs towards Four Leaf,
through a hailstorm of bullets…PORTNOY AND THE GUYS PROVIDE AS MUCH
COVER AS</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: Go on…get outta here. I’m worm food, you
dig?</p>
<p><strong>don’t you die on me!</strong>: You have hands?</p>
<p><strong>on the chopper</strong>: The guys are busy shooting off their
attackers, but they see this moment happening…</p>
<p><strong>back to speedman and four leaf</strong>: The life is draining
from Four Leaf …</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I ain’t Four Leaf, Chris. We’re in this
mess because of me.</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: How did you get hands?</p>
<p><strong>four leaf</strong>: I ain’t never been worth a nothin’…and
it’s too late to start bein’ a somethin’ now. Speedman tries to
understand. He is welling up with emotion.. .real emotion.</p>
<p>****: But you… you can tell the story. . .You have to tell the real
story… And Four Leaf… or Marvin… dies. Speedman begins to weep. Tears.
Yes, he is crying, for real…</p>
<p><strong>speedman</strong>: Don’t you die on me! Don’t you… And his
weeping continues. He then looks up. to see:</p>
<p><strong>hilary swank</strong>: And the Oscar goes to…Chris,Michael
Speedman as himself in “.PLAYING HOOKY</p>
<p><strong>pretended to be him”.</strong>: The audience erupts in
applause. Speedman gets up, hugging Redyk, Portnoy, Sandusky. Even Cody
is there… As he gets near.the stage, KIRK LAZARUS , with his own Oscar
in hand, bear hugs him…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: This is Chris Michael Speedman’s first
Oscar. He joins four time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, tonight’s Best
Supporting Actor winner for the role of Marvin Kaminsky… And we FREEZE
on Speedman and Lazarus, grinning eat to ear, arms’ around each other,
awards in hand…</p>
<p><strong>we fade slowly to black</strong>: After a few moments…</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Ok, look, you wanna go through this again,
let’s do it. I see more for you than this. This whole ‘big fish in the
little scary jungle pond’ thing. I see you as a front man, as a leader,
not just of this little rebel guerilla warrior group. I see it big
picture. Is it music, is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I don’t know.
But I do know it is not happening with you staring at me doing my “I
Know Why The Caged Bird Sings” routine for you and the peanut gallery
for another six months. It’s old school already. TRAN and some HENCHMEN
watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of the henchmen turns a handle which
lowers the cage into the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a
soaking Peck.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: And it makes me sad to see you chomping on the
stogie and you’re not even fourteen or whatever. I’m thinking “what hole
does that need to fill, that you have to keep dipping me into the water
to somehow feel better about yourself?” I can be a partner to you, not
just a captive.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Obviously not. Dare I bring up.a sore subject.
Can we do a little business on the blackberry privileges? Cause you’re
killing me here.</p>
