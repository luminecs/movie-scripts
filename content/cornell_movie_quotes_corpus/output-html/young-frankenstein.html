<p><strong>first villager</strong>: Fumbling fool! For two kronen I’d
rip that box fight out of his hands.</p>
<p><strong>ilse</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>ninety-year-old villager</strong>: Hurry. Idiot, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>agatha</strong>: Quiet, Henrich! We’ve waited seventy
years…another three or four seconds won’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ninety-year-old villager</strong>: Another three of four more
seconds? I could be dead by then.</p>
<p><strong>agatha</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>fifth villager</strong>: What if he’s left you out?</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: Just let him try – I’ll take care of
him.</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: Oh, Mommy…I hardly remember. Did the
Baron really like me when I was a child?</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Like a father!</p>
<p><strong>ninth villager</strong>: Wenn dieser Bloder kerl sich nicht
beeilt verde ich verruckt. Was zum Teufel machte?</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: ‘I, Beaufort Frankenstein, in
this my eighty third year of life, do hereby make, publish and declare
the following statements as and for my last will and testament, and I
direct my executor, Cornelius Waldman, to inform and assemble those
persons previously divulged to him, that they may hear – in my own voice
– the final disposition of my property.’</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: ‘Such disposition to commerce at
the hour of twelve o’clock of my one hundredth birthday. If all the
conditions heretofore set forth have been met, now then – hear once
more, and for the last time…the authenticity of my own voice!’</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: How do you do this
thing? Where? In here? Just talk right into it? All right. Am I close
enough? All right, all right – get the hell out of the way. The once
proud name of Frankenstein has been dragged, by my only son, Victor,
into an abyss of shame. There was a time when the name ‘Frankenstein’
conjured dreams of virtue, of honor and devotion. Now, no guilt, no
malignity, no misery can be found to equal mine. And the catalogue of
sins of my once devoted son will not cease to rankle in my wounds until
death shall close them forever – so supremely frightful is the effect of
any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of
the world. Did you get all that? Are you sure you got ‘rankle in my
wounds’? I’ll kill you if you screw this up. All right, all right. Now
as to the disposition of my estate.</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: To my cousins,
Henrich and Agatha…</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: …and to my cousin
Walter and his wife Ilse…</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: …and to my niece
Helene…</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: …and my dear nephew
Wolfgang…</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: …and lastly, to my
cherished old friend, Marlene, and her charming daughter, Anastasia…</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: …to all of you, in
equal shares, I hereby give, devise and bequeath, absolutely and without
any restrictions whatsoever, all property of every sort and description,
whether real, personal or mixed, to which my estate shall be
entitled.</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: Unless…!</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: It’s a seventy eight.</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: …Unless…my only male
heir, my great-grandson, Frederick – whom I have never seen but who is,
at the time of this recording, ten years of age and residing in America
with my granddaughter, Katherine – has, by his own free will, embraced
Medicine as his career and acquitted himself with some measure of
esteem. Then, to him I leave…everything!</p>
<p><strong>voice of beaufort frankenstein</strong>: My castle, together
with its laboratory, its public and private library, and all notes and
journals contained therein, all acreage surrounding my estate, plus all
income and principle thereof…in the fond hope that yet another
Frankenstein shall lift our family name to an eminence of dignity, and
sanity, that it once enjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: Herr Falkstein! Did you inform
Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the
time and place?</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: I did, sir.</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: But I received a cable only this
morning, saying that he could not come.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: Was he aware of the importance of
this occasion?</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was
obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: What lecture could be more
important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: ‘Functional areas of the cerebrum in
relation to the skull.’</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Waldman – excuse me for
interrupting. But is Frederick, then…a medical doctor?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: Yes, my dear, he is.</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: And has he achieved…any special degree of
eminence?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: He is the fifth leading authority
in his field.</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: Herr Falkstein – you must go at
once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his
inheritance. The estate will provide for your journey.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: I object, Herr Waldman! This is a travesty.
If the beloved great- grandson cared anything at all for the House of
Frankenstein, he would have shown it by being here with those of us who
still have some respect. I think we should completely disregard the
afterthoughts of a very old man.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: Madam – the foundation of
civilization rests upon adherence to the law. And the Law is the Law.
Das Gesetz ist das Gesetz!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: Herr Falkstein! You have your
instructions!</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius waldman</strong>: I have taken an oath that each
letter of this testament shall be executed…and by God, it shall be
done!</p>
<p><strong>lecturer’s voice</strong>: If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull, there’s very little of the
midbrain that we can actually see.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer’s voice</strong>: Yet, as I demonstrated in my
lecture last week, if the under aspects of the temporal lobes are gently
pulled apart, the upper portion of the stem of the brain can be
seen.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer’s voice</strong>: This so called ‘brain stem’
consists of the midbrain, a rounded protrusion called the pons, and a
stalk tapering downwards called the medulla oblongata which passes out
of the skull through the foramen magnum and becomes, of course…the
spinal cord.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer’s voice</strong>: Which brings us directly to the
demonstration prepared for today. Are there any questions before we
proceed?</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: I have one question,
Dr. Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: That’s ‘Fronkonsteen.’</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: Oh! I thought it was
Dr. Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: No, it’s Dr. Fronkonsteen!</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: But aren’t you the grandson of the
famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?… who performed such fascinating
experiments in electricity and galvanism?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: That’s true! But my grandfather, Victor was,
after all, what we might politely refer to as… a cuckoo!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my
own small contributions to science. Now if we can proceed to your
questions.</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: Well sir… I’m not sure I understand
the distinction between ‘Reflexive’ and ‘Voluntary’ nerve impulses.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Very good! Since our lab work today is a
demonstration of just that distinction… why don’t we proceed?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What are we actually talking about when we
use the term, ‘Brain’? We are talking about… a cauliflower!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: May I have the cauliflower, please!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: If we make a small slit, down the center of
this cauliflower…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …and then, ever so gently, gently, gently…
pull it apart…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …we should find, with any luck at all… a
stalk of… celery!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Where did you get this cauliflower?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: From your office, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Didn’t you prepare it with the celery before
my lecture?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong
one when we came up.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Are you trying to make me look like an
idiot?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: No, sir. It will never happen again.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Here! This cauliflower is useless to me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: With any normal cauliflower, we would have
found a stalk of celery, or… ‘Brain Stem’ which brings us to the
practical application of our study.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Mr. Hilltop here – with whom I have never
worked of given any prior instructions to – has graciously offered his
services for this afternoon’s demonstration. Mr. Hilltop!</p>
<p><strong>hilltop</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Have we ever seen each other before this
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>hilltop</strong>: No, sir. FREDDY Tell them!</p>
<p><strong>hilltop</strong>: No, sir – we haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Do I lie? Would you be so kind enough to hop
up on your feet and stand beside this table.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Mr. Hilltop! Would you raise your left knee,
please!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You have just witnessed a ‘Voluntary’ nerve
impulse. It begins as a stimulus from the cerebral cortex, passes
through the brain stem and then to the particular muscle involved.
Mr. Hilltop, you may lower your knee.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ’Reflex movements are those which are made
independently of the will, but are carried out along pathways which pass
between the periphery and the central nervous system. You filthy,
rotten, yellow son of a BITCH!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: We are not aware of the impulses, neither do
we intend them to contract our muscles. Yet – as you can see – they work
by themselves.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Now then! Modern research has shown us that
by simply applying local pressure of ’ blocking’ the nerve impulse…
which can be done with any ordinary metal clamp…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: … Just at the swelling on the posterior
nerve root – for, oh say five or six seconds…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Why you mother-grabbing BASTARD!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All communication is shut off. Similarly,
damage to a nerve will mean that not all the impulses can get through
and there will be weakness of a muscle…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …or group of muscles, with some loss of skin
sensation on the area supplied by that nerve. In spite of our mechanical
magnificence, if there is not this continuous stream of impulses… we
would collapse like… a bunch of broccoli.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Give him an extra dollar.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: In conclusion… it should be noted that more
than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because… once a
nerve fibber is severed… there is no way to regenerate life back into
it. Are there any more questions before we leave?</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: Dr. Fronkonsteen!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: Isn’t it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary
means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: A piece of what?</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: Vermicelli.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Are you speaking of the worm, or … the
spaghetti.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Why the worm, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ah! In science you must be very precise – it
can spell the difference between life and death. I don’t want that
fellow in class next semester.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: He has a big mouth. Yes! It seems to me I
did read something about that incident as a student. But you have to
remember that a worm – with very few exceptions – is not a human
being.</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: But wasn’t that the whole basis of
your grandfathers work, sir…? the re-animation of component parts?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: My father was a sick man.</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: But aren’t you the least bit
curious about it, Doctor? Doesn’t the secret of life hold any intrigue
for you?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You are talking about the gibberish ravings
of a lunatic mind.</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: Yes, but, sir… if it could be
accomplished, wouldn’t that eliminate disease from the human frame and
render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How old are you, young man?</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: Nineteen, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Nineteen! My dear young man… once the human
organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be
dead.</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: But look at what’s been done with
hearts and kidneys!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I’m
talking about the Central Nervous System.</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: But, sir…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I am a scientist…! not a philosopher.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You have more chance of re-animating this
knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,</p>
<p><strong>medical student</strong>: But your grandfather’s work,
sir…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: My grandfather’s work was Doo-Doo! Dead is
Dead! There’s only one thing I am interested in… and that is the
preservation of LIFE!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Class… is… dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Carlson!</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape
and some disinfectant.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Yes, sir. Do you want the other
cauliflower?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: … No!</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Dr. Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Fron kon steen!</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: My name is Gerhart Falkstein.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: One hundred thousand dollars???</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Oh, at least, sir. The land alone is
worth a small fortune.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But I can’t just drop everything and leave.
I have responsibilities and obligations.</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Do you have a hundred thousand of
them, sir?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How long will this whole thing take?</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: A week. Ten days at most.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’ll have to think it over. It’s not so easy
just to pick up and…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Curious melody! Haunting, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What’s that tune that you’re playing</p>
<p><strong>old violinist</strong>: Zis is an old Transylvanian
Lullaby.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: May I see your violin?</p>
<p><strong>old violinist</strong>: It’s an honor for me, sir. You play
the violin?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, just a little.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Nice! Nice little balance to it.</p>
<p><strong>old violinist</strong>: Ja, ja.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well… if you’re sure that I could accomplish
everything in a week… I suppose I could manage it.</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Break that old man’s violin.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I didn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: The old violinist – you smashed his
violin over your knee.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I did not do that. Why would I do a thing
like that…? Are you insane?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right then, I suppose I owe the family
that much. You’ll have everything ready for me when I arrive?</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: One week at the most!?</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: One week – I’ll see to it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well, thank you very much for all your
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Not at all – a great privilege,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Saturday night then! I’ll take the train to
New York and fly from there.</p>
<p><strong>herr falkstein</strong>: Saturday night, yes, sir. Have a
pleasant journey!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Darling!…you will be careful!?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You have your tickets?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And your passport?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Call me from New York before you
leave??</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Promise??</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, darling – I’ll count the hours that
you’re away.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, darling – so will I.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Board! All aboard!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’d better leave.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Will you miss me?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Very….very!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mother’s going to help me with the
invitations.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, nice.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I hope you like large weddings.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’ve trimmed the list to only our very
closest friends…but it still comes to three thousand.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You’re incorrigible!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Does that mean you love me?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You bet your boots it does.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: All aboard!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hurry now – before I make a fool of
myself.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Goodbye, darling.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Goodbye, Freddy! Hurry back to me!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I will! Goodbye, darling!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Goodbye, darling.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Goodbye, darling.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Goodbye, darling!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: New York next! Everyone out for New
York!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Transylvania nachste! Jeder austeigen fur
TRANSYLVANIA!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Pardon me, boy! Is that the Transylvania
Station?</p>
<p><strong>german boy</strong>: Ja, this is track twenty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>german boy</strong>: Oh, can I give you a shine?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Thank you, no.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Frederick Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Fron kon steen!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Are you putting me on?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: No, it’s pronounced Fron kon steen.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And do you also say Fro dereck?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: No, Fred ereck.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Why isn’t it Frodereck Fronkon steen?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s not. It’s Fredereck Fronkonsteen.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You must be Igor.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: No, it’s pronounced Aye gor.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But they told me it was Ee gor.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Well, they were wrong then, weren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Yes, that’s right. My grandfather and your
grandfather used to pal around together. You and I should have a lot of
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m sure we will.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: This is Inga. They thought you might need an
assistant temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Extremely well.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How nice.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Are these your bags?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, just the two.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Did you have a pleasant trip?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, thank you. It wasn’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Sun – rise… Sun – set! Dee – dum… Dee –
dum.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>dracula</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Did you ever have a roll in the hay?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m not sure I…get your drift.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: You should try it – it’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Incidentally – I don’t mean to embarrass you
in any way, but I’m a rather brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I can help you
with that hump.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What hump?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well…perhaps we can talk about it later.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Sometimes I’m afraid of the lightning.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be
afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: There wolf! There castle!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Why are you talking like that?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I thought you wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Suit yourself…I’m easy. Better watch out for
the wockers.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What wockers?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: The wockers with the knockers.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wockers with the knockers???</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Go ahead, play dumb! You’ll lose your sockers
and then be fockers.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Well, there it is…</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Home!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Welcome! I am Frau Blucher.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Down! Down! Steady!!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How do you do? I am Dr. Fronkonsteen. This
is my assistant. Inga – may I present Frau Blucher.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Down! Get down, you beasts!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I wonder what’s got into them?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Your rooms are ready, Herr Doctor. If
you will follow me, please.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Aye-gor! We’ll wait for you inside. Hurry,
please!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: After you Frau Blucher.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Easy. Easy! What’s very sticky and rhymes with
shoe?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I’ll be back shortly. Just think of model
airplanes.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Shall we proceed?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: I hope you find this comfortable. This
was Baron Victor’s room.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It seems fine.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: You’ll fine the keys to all the rooms
in my cas… all the rooms in your castle on this ring. I’ll leave it on
the table here.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Does that include the key to the
laboratory?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: You mean… the laboratory??</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes!… the laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept that
separate.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: May I have it, please?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: There seem to be quite a few books.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Yes, this was Victor’s… the Baron’s
medical library.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I see. And where is my grandfather’s private
library?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: I don’t know what you mean, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: well, there was a public and a private
library – he said so in his will. these books are all very general – any
doctor might have them in his study.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: This is the only library I know
of.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Surely he kept his notes – his private
papers and records in some other place?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: I think you must be mistaken, sir.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well… we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Will there be anything else?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I don’t think so. Is my assistant taken care
of?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: I put her in the guest room, just down
the hall.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Are you busy?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: That’s quite all right. What is it,
dear?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Could I lie down in your bed for a little
while? I just can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: We only arrived a few minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I know, but usually I can fall asleep right
away. It must be the strange room.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh please – just till I get sleepy. Then you
can force me right back to my room.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for
just a little while.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Would you like a sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: No, thanks! I want to get right to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well… I’ll just finish unpacking.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Stop it. Stop it, I tell you I don’t want to
be perfect. Can’t you understand that? I don’t want to be perfect!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Inga!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes, you may… but don’t make any noise.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Inga, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: What is it? Is something wrong, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Listen! Don’t you hear that strange
music?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes! What could it be at this hour?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I don’t know. It just woke me up.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It seem to be coming from behind this
bookcase.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Hand me one of those candles!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Dr. Fronkonsteen – look!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Whatever it is, it’s coming from down there.
I’m going down to see.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Let me come with you, Doctor, please! I don’t
want to stay up here alone.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right then, quietly! Close your robe and
stay right behind me. Don’t make a sound!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Aye-gor!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Fro-derick!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came
down here.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But what you were doing?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Just putting up some tea.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Did you hear that strange music?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Did you hear that strange music??</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Did you hear that strange music?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: No, not sound.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: There must have been someone else down here
then.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It seems that way. You didn’t hear any music
at all?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You didn’t hear… nothing! Aren’t there any
lights in this place?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Two switches over there, but I wasn’t going to
be the first.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Well, it’s all right for atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Ooh!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What a filthy mess.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I don’t know… a little paint, some
flowers…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Did you see anyone else down here?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: No, but when I first came in, there was a
light coming from behind that steel door.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Look, Doctor!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well, this explains the music.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: But who was playing it?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I don’t know, but whoever it was barely
finished putting out his cigar. It’s still smoldering. Let me smell your
breath.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well, it wasn’t you.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Must be the music room.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: There’s nothing but books and papers.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I wonder…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It is! This was my grandfather’s private
library. Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: ‘How I Did It.’ Good title!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Funny it should just be lying out here on
the table. I wonder what kind of dribble this is?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ‘Whence, I often asked myself, did the
principles of life proceed? To examine the causes of life… we must first
have recourse to death.’ God, what a looney bin!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh, doctor!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Perhaps we’d better leave.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Taking the book along?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, I think we could all use a good
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: This guy is too much.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ‘…and as soon as the dazzling light
vanished, the oak tree had disappeared. I knew then that electricity and
galvanism had changed my life.’</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: This guy is bonkers! Did you ever hear
anything like this??</p>
<p><strong>freddy’s voice</strong>: ‘When I look back now, it seems to
me as if this almost miraculous event obliterated any last effort by the
spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in
the stars.’</p>
<p><strong>freddy’s voice</strong>: He kills me! This guy kills me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy’s voice</strong>: ‘Until, from the midst of this
darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me – a light so brilliant and
wondrous, and yet so simple!’</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ‘Change the poles from plus to minus and
from minus to plus!’</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ‘I alone succeeded in discovering the cause
of generation of life.’</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ‘Nay, even more – I, myself became capable
of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.’</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It could work!!</p>
<p><strong>destiny of all those who bear the</strong>: NAME OF
‘FRANKENST’ NAME OF ‘FRANKENSTEIN’</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ‘As the minuteness of the parts formed a
great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a
gigantic stature.’ Of course! That would simplify everything.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: And look at this, Doctor!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: ‘Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic
impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to
approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.’</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: His what??</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: His schwanzstucker.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Whew! A nineteen-inch drill.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Now then! What we’re aiming for, is a being
about eight feet in height, and all features proportionably large.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Something like this?</p>
<p><strong>freddy’s voice</strong>: You’ve caught something there. Yes!
As a matter of fact – I think – that this – might – be – our – man!</p>
<p><strong>executioner</strong>: Have anything to say?</p>
<p><strong>the body</strong>: MMmmmgrrrrrrrrr!</p>
<p><strong>executioner</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>the body</strong>: Go shove it up your –</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He was an angel.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He was a saint!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: She had to marry this rotten pig
instead.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hanging was too good – they should have
soaked him in lye.</p>
<p><strong>first grave digger</strong>: What a filthy job!</p>
<p><strong>second grave digger</strong>: Could be worse!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What a filthy job!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Could be worse!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Could be raining!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wait! Let’s tip the coffin over, then just
lift it off. It’ll be much easier.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Now…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Set it down!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Magnificent!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Very little decay. With this magnificent
specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.
You know what to do!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I have a pretty good idea.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Do you have the name I wrote down?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I want that brain.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Was he any good?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Was he any good??? He was the finest natural
philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of
this century.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Hmm!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: That’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Can you imagine that brain in this body?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I’m getting excited just thinking about it.
What if he’s not there?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: He only died two weeks ago – I’m sure
they’ll still have him. Hurry now. I’ll prepare the body.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Oh! May I call you ‘Master’?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It’s always been one of my favorite names.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: If you like – just hurry!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Thank you, Master.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Look at this hand! Look at these
fingers!</p>
<p><strong>albertus magnus cornelius agrippa lawrence
talbot</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Funny thing is… I tried!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Freud would have a heyday with this. Well…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Finished!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: What a beautiful job!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ready??</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You’re sure you know what you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes! It’s all written down in the notes. Tie
off the kites and come down!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Yes, master. Just don’t turn on any
radios.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven
shall be mine.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh, Frederick… you’re not only a great doctor,
you’re a great… you’re almost a…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: A god?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You’d better hurry – I think it’s going to
rain.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right… elevate me!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Right here?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Raise the platform, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh! Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: The ancient masters promised impossibilities
and performed nothing. We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.
We shall ascend into the Heavens. We shall command the thunders of
Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its
own shadows.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes! When I give the word – throw the first
switch!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You’ve got it, master.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Get ready!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Get set!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Go!!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Throw the second switch!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: This guy means business.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s not enough. More! More, do you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: More, do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Throw the third switch!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Wait till he sees the bill.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right – turn everything off and bring me
down!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Reputation. Reputation!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I thought it was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I don’t understand – I followed the notes to
the letter.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You can’t win ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But there must be a reason. This is science,
not art.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Pass the Wildschweinbraten mit
Gewurzgurkensosse, please.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Let’s look once more. I can’t stand just
sitting here doing nothing. Maybe we left to soon.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Cold! Cold and dead!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You mustn’t take it so hard. Bucharest wasn’t
built in a day.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Don’t try to cheer me up that way.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Well, I don’t like to see you mope.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You’ll be getting me sad next.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t mean to take out my
frustration on you. You’ve been a great help to me, and I’ve let you
down.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I’m not that sort you know. I appreciate you
feelings, but try to show them some other way.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You’re right! Self-pity never got anyone
anywhere. Let’s go back and finish our dinner.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Schwartzwalder Kirschtorte.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, do you like it? I’m not partial to
desserts, but this is excellent.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Who are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: To you! You just made a ‘yummy’ sound, so I
thought you liked the dessert.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I didn’t make a ‘yummy’ sound – I just asked
what it was.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But you did – I just heard it.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: It wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Look here - if it wasn’t you, and it wasn’t
you, and it wasn’t me…</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh, Doctor!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I think you’ve done it, master.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Alive! Look at it. I have defeated
death!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Better not get too close, master. This guy
could kill you.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I suppose you’re right. Inga! Prepare a
sedative, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s trying to talk. it wants us to take off
the straps.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Don’t fall for that one.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But don’t you see…the brain of Hans Delbruck
is inside this grotesque hulk – pleading with us. I’ve got to untie
it.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: careful, master – you never can tell with
these chaps.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right…stand back!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMmmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How’s everything?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m going to untie you – can you understand
that?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmmm! MMMmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, I’m going to set you free. Is the
sedative ready?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s alive. It’s – moving! It’s – breathing!
It’s – standing! What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: … It’s.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Original.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Give – me – your – hand!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Whew! I’m glad that’s over with.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You can say that again.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You’re just supposed to repeat what you
said.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What’s the point of my setup? It’s not funny
unless you repeat exactly what you said.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m not trying to be funny.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Repeat it anyway – it’s a wonderful cue.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: … I’m glad that’s…</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: No, no! That whole thing!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: … Whew! I’m glad that’s over with.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMmmmmmmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: See what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmm! MMMmmm!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I think ‘It’ wants to do it again Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: What do you think we should do?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh…let’s do it a little more.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmm!</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMmmmmm! MMMMmmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Stop that! Now just stop that this instant
and listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I have given you one of the finest minds of
this century. You are a brilliant endocrinologist. You are a superb
scientist. And you are making naughty! Now that’s enough. Finished! From
now on, you will behave like a man, and not a spoiled, snot-nosed,
sniveling brat who thinks he can get anything he wants by bullying
people with sheer brute force.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: This fellow’s got great timing.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh, Doctor – be careful!</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Mmmmmm! Mmmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Doctor! There’s that strange music again. what
could it be?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ayegor! Find out where that music is coming
from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Yes, Master!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Act casual!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Care for a jujubee?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Clever ploy!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: NO movies together for us – that’s for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: It’s almost as if he were afraid. he loves
that music.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I think he wants you to carry him, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I think I’ll…carry him.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Doctor! The music has stopped.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Do you think you can sing it?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Me? Sing?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes – quickly, dear!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I’d be so nervous.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: This is not the finals – just sing!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: It’s some-thing dar-ing, ‘The Con-ti-nen-tal,’
A way of danc-ing that’s real-ly ul-tra new; It’s ver-y sub-tle, ‘The
Con-ti-nen-tal.’</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Be-cause it does what you want it to do.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: It has a pas-sion, ‘The Con-ti nen-tal…’</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Stop – singing!!!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Someone was playing this in the music
room.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: How do you know it was a ‘he’?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right – where is she?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: How do you know it was a ‘she’?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Bring – me – the – violin!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Can you play it?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Maybe…if you get here on time.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: It’s working! Oh, Doctor – you play
beautifully.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Do you know the theme from ‘Doctor
Zhivago’?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Get the sedative ready!</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMmmm! MMmmm!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I think he wants to be tucked in.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Get a blanket from under that shelf!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right – give it to him!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Are you serious??</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Give him the sedative!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh! Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: He’s got quite a tush.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Good! It shouldn’t take more than a few
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMmmmmmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I’m getting tired.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Why don’t we all turn in? It’s been a long
day.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wait – I’m sure he’s out by now. That shot
was strong enough to stop a horse.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: See you at breakfast, then!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Good night, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Good night!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Thanks…for all your help.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: That’s what we’re paid for.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: This song. This haunting melody. This
ancient, quaintly atonal folk tune…is driving – me – crackers! I can’t
go on – do you understand?? Can NOT go on playing this pathogenically
rotten song. If you’re not asleep yet, then kill me if you have to, but
at the count of three…I stop! One!……………. Incidentally, I was thinking of
making a big breakfast tomorrow – blueberry waffles and crisp bacon.
Two!… …………………. By the way, I’m sorry I yelled at you before – I must
have been over- tired. Anyway, I meant to apologize and just forgot.
Two!…………… Maybe tomorrow would be a good day just to relax – go for a
swim, maybe do a little water skiing. Well…we’ll see after we finish a
nice breakfast. Three!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Spoiled Sissy!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: The song is over!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Das lied ist aus!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh! Oh my! What a strange feeling that was.
My head – I felt such a pressure, splitting my head apart. I feel so
relieved and lightheaded. That horrible pressure…like voices…all calling
to me, imploring me…swearing at me. Well, it’s over now, thank goodness.
Oh…my poor Doctor Delbruck. Doctor, Doctor…what have I done to you? Was
habe ich von Dir gamacht? Your magnificent brain, locked in this…pile
of… Forgive me, Doctor. I thought – for science only. I couldn’t stand
the thought to mankind. I was a fool! How dangerous is the acquirement
of knowledge, and how much happier is that man who believes his native
town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his
nature will allow. Con you ever forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: That’s a knockout tune! That tune is a
winner. You can’t call it ‘wishy-washy’ … like some people I know. That
song is going places. And so are we – Blubber Boy. With your body, and
the brain of that kraut – we’ll be ‘Number One’ in no time.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Right, voices?? I hear you skipping away in
there. ‘Do better than your father!’ You’re telling me I will. ‘Do
better than my grandfather!?’ I’ll make my famous grandfather look like
a part-time nurse.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: There’s no stopping now. Destiny is too
potent. I – want – perfection!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I want a lot of it…and the best there
is.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Because from now on…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …the only act we follow is the creation of
fire. I’m going to explore unknown powers…I’m going to unfold to the
world the deepest mysteries of creation…and I’m going to make – my –
mommy – proud!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And one and two and three and four and lift
– lift , three and four and don’t look sad for sympathy; you know we
only stop to pee. And lift – lift, three and four and try and not to
break the floor.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And one and two and point your toes and two
and two and stretch you thighs and three and two and lift your knees and
watch that nasty temper, please.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And one and two and point your toes…</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And Oh-oh, Oh-oh…there he goes.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And oopy, not so hasty, please, and stretch
your legs and lift your knees.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And even though we’re nose to nose, Always,
always point your toes!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And one and two and stretch your thighs and
two and two and lift your knees…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And now, my fellow scientists and
neurosurgeon…I must ask you to …suspend belief. For up until now, you
have seen the Creature perform the simple mechanics of motor activity.
That this Creature was an inanimate blob, which I endowed with the
secret of life – yes!…in all honesty – that showed some measure of skill
on my part. But for what you are about to see next…we must enter –
quietly – into the realm of genius. I say this modestly, only because I
am, myself, as in awe of the gifts I possess as if I were observing them
in some other person. I think of them, only, as a loan. Grateful, of
course…that my credit is good. Thus, with the accumulated knowledge of
Chemistry, Electricity, Neuro- surgery…and art…I now present what was
once an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues. Ladies and gentlemen…
Mesdames et Messieurs… Damen und Herren…The Creature!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: If you’re blue and you don’t know where to
go to, why don’t you…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …go where fashion sits…………………….</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Poo – tmmm anngh ma Ritz!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Diff’rent types who wear a day coat, pants
with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits…………………….</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Poo – tmmm anngh ma Ritz!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Soo – pah doo – per.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Come let’s mix where Rock- e – fellers walk
with sticks or ‘um-ber- el-las’ in their mitts…………………….</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: That’s your cue. Go on!</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …Su-per du-per. Come let’s mix where Rock-
e-fellers walk with sticks or ‘um-ber- el-las’ in their
mitts…………………….</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: For God’s sake – go on! Are you trying to
make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur! Sing!!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Booooo! Get him off! Fake! What else can
your toy do?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Fake?? You stupid idiots…you call my
creation a fake??? What do you know about truth? You’re the fakes! All
of you! I wouldn’t come to you with a hang-nail.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wait! Stop! Don’t give them the
satisfaction. I know it’s tough, but look at how far we’ve come! Are you
going to throw it all away now??</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Don’t you think I know that? But what are
you judging by? Bucharest??? This was always a hick town. They can’t get
a ‘Bus and Truck’ company to come in here. Are you going to let these
idiots get the best of you? …Or are you going to stand up like a man and
show them that you’ve got more dignity in your little finger than
they’ve got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I chose the wrong song.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m a failure.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Come on, Froderick – none of that.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Look how far we’ve come.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You can’t expect to iron out all the kinks in
one night.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I think the doctor is a genius! Don’t you,
Igor?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Why certainly. Don’t you, Frau Blucher?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: He’s a failure.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What are you waiting around for, pickle
puss?</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: This wire came while you were gone.
Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Elizabeth!?! ‘Can’t waits any longer. Arrive
in your arms at ten tonight.’ Oh, God! Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Why, doctor…how wonderful for you.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wonderful? It’s terrible! Terrible,
terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: She sounds fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>six-year-old-girl</strong>: Mit kommen, mit kommen. Du bist
immer eine schlafmutzigem Blind- schleiche.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Surprised!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Love me?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Love you! …Well, why don’t we turn in?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Darling!?!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I mean, it’s been a long day. I’m sure you
must be as tired as I am. Oh! These are my assistants: Inga and
Ayegor.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Very well. So nice to meet you at last.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well… yes.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Miss me?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ready, darling?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Give me a hand with these, will you,
Ayegor?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Certainly, master.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What a strange fellow.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, he’s a little bit… tilted. Harmless,
though.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Why does he call you ‘master’?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Are you suggesting I call him master???</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No, of course not. I just meant…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: All right then!</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Yes, sir, name, please?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Food!</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Do you have a reservation?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Food!!</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. We only seat by
reservation.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Drink!</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Oh, no sir-ee. If yo don’t have a
reservation you can skip to ma-loo.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Foooooood!</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Now just one moment. There’s no need for
roughhousing. Have you ever tried a tip?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Franz! Help! Lunatic!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Poor Delbruck! There must be some way to
reach him – to control that body.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Darling, you mustn’t worry so.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But there’s a genius inside that body –
crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships. I
just have to find some way to re-establish his communications
system.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: But you can’t do that at night. And even
if you could – it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien
tachlas von Dir?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’ve done everything that’s humanly
possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I’m so worried about you – you need
rest.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I suppose you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Of course I am. Now come along like a
good boy.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What would I do without you?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is your room just down the hall? … in
case I get frightened during the night?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, but… I thought, perhaps tonight, under
the circumstances, I might… stay here with you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, darling! Don’t let’s spoil
everything.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I don’t want to spoil anything – I just want
to top it all off.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Would you want me, now, like this, so
soon before our wedding? … So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a
little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?… When I
can be totally and unashamedly yours??</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: That’s a tough choice.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is it worth taking a chance?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I suppose you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Of course I am. Now give me a kiss and
say good night like my good boy.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That’s my good boy.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Why, Doctor… is anything the matter?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Just passing through the night.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: What’s wrong, Doctor? You seem… lonely.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, a little. But it’s not just physical
loneliness. It’s the pangs that come from missing someone
intellectually… as I have you.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I’ve missed you intellectually, too,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s terrible – the price society demands in
the name of fidelity… ultimately?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Not fooling around.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I know, but I mean – not fooling around
physically?… Or not fooling around intellectually?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I see what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: There can never… ever… be anything physical
between us. You know that, dear.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: I know Frederick.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It wouldn’t be fair to Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: For that matter, it wouldn’t be fair to you,
or to me.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I say, it wouldn’t be fair to you… or to
me.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Nor to Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: No. Nor to Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: We all have our feelings. I know that I have
mine. And… I wouldn’t want to hurt yours.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, I do have my feelings. And, of course,
you have yours.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: And Elizabeth has hers.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, Elizabeth has hers.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: But, after all, you have yours.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes, I have mine.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: And I have mine.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yes…yes, you have yours.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Why don’t we talk inside?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well… … perhaps for a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>first villager</strong>: Burgomeister Krempen.</p>
<p><strong>second villager</strong>: Burgomeister Krempen!</p>
<p><strong>third villager</strong>: Burgomeister Krempen!</p>
<p><strong>fourth villager</strong>: Mayor Krempen!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: What is it? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>first villager</strong>: The monster, sir. The Monster is
loose.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Do you realize it’s after eight
o’clock???</p>
<p><strong>second villager</strong>: Yes, sir, but the monster. He’s
escaped!</p>
<p><strong>third villager</strong>: He’s running through the
countryside, terrorizing the villagers. No one is safe.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: What do you mean ‘the’ monster – as if
this happened every Sunday. You mean ‘a’ monster.</p>
<p><strong>fourth villager</strong>: No, sir, it’s ‘the’ monster. The
Frankenstein monster.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Oh, Tommy Rot!</p>
<p><strong>assorted villagers</strong>: Yes! Frankenstein! The
Frankenstein monster!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Now wait a minute! Just wait a
minute!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Now see here! There’ll be no more wild
accusations bandied about while I’m still Burgomeister of this village.
If there is mischief afoot, the way to find out is to confront the man
with the charges brought against him. It’s the only decent thing to do.
And as long as I’m Burgomeister of your village – a man’s name is still
his honor.</p>
<p><strong>first villager</strong>: But it’s true, sir. Young Master
Freddy – he’s come from America and read all of his grandfather’s secret
notes. They’ve started the whole business all over again, sir.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: That swine!</p>
<p><strong>second villager</strong>: It’s in the blood, sir. The whole
family is insane.</p>
<p><strong>third villager</strong>: He’s got to be put away.</p>
<p><strong>fourth villager</strong>: And the monster destroyed!</p>
<p><strong>assorted villagers</strong>: Yes! The monster! Kill the
monster! The monster must be destroyed!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Now see here! Before we go running
about, killing people, we’d better make damned sure of our facts. A riot
is an ugly thing… and once you get one started – there’s little chance
of stopping it short of bloodshed.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: So the first thing we’ll do, is march
calmly up to the Frankenstein castle and have a nice little chat with
our good doctor. Now then! Who doesn’t have a torch and a dog? All right
– follow me!</p>
<p><strong>assorted villagers</strong>: Yay! Down with Frankenstein!
Kill the monster!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It wouldn’t be right… you know that.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It wouldn’t be fair to her.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You’ve got to help me to remain
faithful.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes, I will.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …But an intellectual relationship, like this
– we could have as often as we wanted. Three times a day – anything!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Frederick Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You have the wrong house.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: And who might you be?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: The grandson of Victor
‘Fronkonsteen’?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: What was your grandfather’s name?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Victor Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Forgive me for intruding so late at
night, Herr Baron. But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange
goings on in this castle. These good citizens are ready to rip you from
limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their
fears. How say you?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ugly, vicious rumous.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: They say, also, that you have
recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and
terrorized the God-fearing people of this village. What say you to
that?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Poppycock!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: He’s back! He’s back! The monster’s back!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What monster?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What d’ya mean “What monster?’ You
remember…the one we madein the basement.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I think we all need a good night’s sleep.
Why don’t we meet next week and thrash this thing out?</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Now wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You don’t understand, Master. The big fellow’s
broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: He’s carrying her off now through the
woods.</p>
<p><strong>assorted villagers</strong>: There he is! That’s the monster!
After him! Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What now, boss? A little something to eat and
then join the chase?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: No! The only hope now is to get him back
here. If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his
cerebellum…</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: That sound good, boss.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: … and equalize the imbalance in his
cerebrospinal fluid…</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I like your style, master. How do we get him
here?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: There’s only one way.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I’ll bet it’s a doozy.</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>1st villager</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: There he is!!</p>
<p><strong>1st villager</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>burgomeuster</strong>: I said – there he is!</p>
<p><strong>tall villager</strong>: Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! It’s
ME!</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMmmm.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMmmm!</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What……….?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What in God’s name are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Baack!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Baack!</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Morrr!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh my goodness! Nineteen if it’s an
inch.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Penny for your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re incorrigible!… Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: All right then… seven’s always been my
lucky number.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What, dear? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMmm!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is it that music?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: MMMMM! MMMMM!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Probably just some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Where are you going? They’ve left their
F-M station on, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Come on, big fellow!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Is everything ready?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Yes, master. Are you sure you want to go
through with it?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Okay, boss! But I hope you know what you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>1st villager</strong>: Wait a minute! maybe he went back to
the castle.</p>
<p><strong>2nd villager</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>3rd villager</strong>: He’s probably right.</p>
<p><strong>2nd villager</strong>: It was all a trick by that lunatic
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>3rd villager</strong>: Let’s go back there and tear them both
to pieces!</p>
<p><strong>4th villager</strong>: Now see here. Let’s not lese our
heads. We’ve always listened to our Burgomeister in the past. We should
have the decency to hear him now.</p>
<p><strong>1st villager</strong>: Well – what do you say,
Burgomeister?</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: Let’s go back there and tear them to
pieces!</p>
<p><strong>assorted villagers</strong>: Yay! Back to the castle! Kill
them both!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It’s the waiting I can’t stand.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: How do you know they’re done?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: The doctor said to allow seven minutes: no
more and no less – or else they could both become hopelessly
paralyzed.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: How long is it so far?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Four</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Three minutes to go!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What d’ya want to do to kill time?</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Oh, Igor – I’m so afraid! I just hope this all
ends well.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Igor – are you sure the monster has a good
brain? Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans
Delbruck that night?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Absolutely! May my mother grow two heads if
I’m not telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Sounds like visitors. It’s all right – Frau
Blucher will show them in.</p>
<p><strong>frau blucher</strong>: Victor. Victor! I’m coming. I’m
comming, Victor!</p>
<p><strong>first villager</strong>: There they are!</p>
<p><strong>assorted villagers</strong>: Kill them! Kill that doctor!
Kill the monster! Tear them both to pieces!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Igor – what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Oh, must be around ten… ten-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Igor – the clock! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Another fifteen seconds to go.</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: Do Something! Stall them!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Now see here! What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: We want the doctor!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: We want the doctor!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>first villager</strong>: … Come on, men!</p>
<p><strong>second villager</strong>: Here’s that crackpot doctor. Let’s
get him first!</p>
<p><strong>inga</strong>: No! Please!</p>
<p><strong>a giant voice</strong>: Put that man down!</p>
<p><strong>an old woman</strong>: Why…it’s the monster!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: No, it couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>third villager</strong>: Yes it is. It must be.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: I said: Put that man down!</p>
<p><strong>burgomeister</strong>: And who are you, sir, that you order
these people about?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: I am a relative of the doctor’s. I came to
visit him a few weeks ago, in hopes that this distinguished member of my
family might be able to help me with a problem that I’ve had since
birth…and which has caused more sorrow in my heart than I wish on any
man.</p>
<p><strong>assorted villagers</strong>: What’d he say? Relative??</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: You see, because of my great size and the
somewhat unusual features of my head – when women look at me, their
first impulse is to scream; children often cry, or vomit; and men are
inclined to beat me over the head.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: I lived in hopes of meeting people who
would..overlook my outward appearance and respect me for whatever good
qualities I had to offer. If anyone had ever shown a little kindness, I
would have returned it, I think, at least one hundred times over. And
for that one person’s sake… I would have made piece with the whole
world. Do you understand what it means – never to see a kind or happy
face? You could imagine then, perhaps, how such bitterness led me, at
last, to the brink of another kind or life. I decided that if I couldn’t
inspire love…which was my deepest hope… I would, instead…cause fear.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: But all of that happened to me a lifetime
ago. And I paid for my crimes…severely. It was just then that fate, or
chance, brought me to our famous doctor. I found this man to be vain; I
found him to be driven with ambitions of personal glory, and consumed
with an unquenchable thirst for power. But even at the height of his
quest – this ego-driven, brilliant and half- crazed
scientist..always…always …held an image of me as something beautiful.
And then, at the moment of truth, when it would have been easy enough to
run and stay out of danger…he used himself as a guinea pig, in order to
give me a calmer brain… and a slightly more eloquent way of speaking.
Yes! I am ‘The Monster”…sometimes known as ’Him,’ or occasionally, ‘The
Creature.’ But they’re one and the same. I am that tall, peculiarly
attractive stranger, with the winning smile. Would you all get the hell
out of here!</p>
