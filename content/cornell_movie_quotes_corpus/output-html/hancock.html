<h1 id="hancock">hancock</h1>
<p><strong>fade in:</strong>: BLACK. It’s everywhere. It swallows the
screen. And so we stare into a sea of BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed. The end came abruptly you could
tell ’cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence. “Shh. ,” the curled lips
attempted. Like it started saying “shucks” or “Shirley” or… “shit
happens.” Your eyes don’t forget things like that. Like you don’t forget
the sound animals make when they’re humping. Primal. Raw. They endure in
you forever because the senses have a brain all their own and they
recall long after you’ve succumbed to the la-la of forgetfulness.
Sometimes when it’s dark out,-so dark it’s black, I’ll see HIM.</p>
<p>****: And it starts all over again. From this blackness, a streak of
LIGHTNING splits the night sky.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The principal did’nothing. Like schoolyard
terrorism is no worse than being tardy. What’s the matter with
education? Back when, you could go to school and learn about Betsy Ross
and… mollusks and… not get stabbed on the way home.</p>
<p><strong>“your mother takes it up the ass.”</strong>: He surveys the
machine. His right arm appears from the coat pocket. Fingers merge into
a tight fist. And casually, he rips into the metal vendor like it was
Jello. His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
Deposits it under his coat. And with that, he heads for the stairs - to
the flooded streets above. At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram
closes its doors. Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel.
White SMOKE mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we…</p>
<p><strong>fish</strong>: How the fuck can I help you sir?</p>
<p><strong>superhero</strong>: A room.</p>
<p><strong>fish</strong>: Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front. And
your John Hancock makes it sweet. The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN
sheet. Scribbles</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: on the dotted line. Fish hands over the
key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock’s grab.</p>
<p><strong>fish</strong>: I don’t take messages, I don’t do favors, and
I don’t know you from Jack. You want sheets, they’re extra. Towel’s
extra. Plunger’s extra.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I need quiet. Is it quiet?</p>
<p><strong>fish</strong>: Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public library
to you? The girls work. Some of them scream, some of them moan…</p>
<p>****: and some of them just kinda lay there cold. You want quiet, I
got cotton balls you can stick in your ear. They’re extra.</p>
<p><strong>u-rent security co.</strong>: Their motto: “TO OBSERVE AND
RECORD” Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: How’s the eye?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Black. Horus enters. Stands awkwardly before
his son.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: It’ll be gone in a week. Mom’11 touch it up
with some make-up and you won’t even know it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah I will. And I don’t want any girly
make-up on my face. Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13
knees.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: There’ll always be people around who’ll…
exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace. Aaron
listens, observing his father’s efforts.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: The thing to do is… to avoid them. They’re
no-wins. Can’t-wins. You hold the anger… and move on. You hold the
anger. I tell you because I can’t take it, seeing you hurt. You’re part
of me.</p>
<p>****: I’ve felt what you’re feeling now. And if you’ve got any of me
in you, you’re gonna feel what I felt-when you go up against one of ’em.
Turn away… that’s what you do… the other cheek. You do that for me. No,
you’re not the coward. Not you. No. I’ll be the coward, all right?
’Cause I don’t want to see you hurt. I love you. I ask you to do that
for me… your old man. And while he utters these words, Mary watches from
the dark hallway - moved b y his affection. She oversees a father-son
embrace.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I’m late for work. Get some sleep. Tomorrow
always feels better…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: .after a good night sleep. The light FLICKS
off and the man’s silhouette form exits the room.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary.</p>
<p><strong>by</strong>: the moment. And out of nowhere…</p>
<p>****: I’m late. Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like
she almost expected it.</p>
<p>****: Right.</p>
<p>****: Coffee’s by the door. She marches back into the kitchen. Horus
stares at his feet. S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the
face. He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos. A look
at Mary and he’s out thedoo rt</p>
<p>****: Ooh yeah, big fella. That’s it. Shoot your load, baby. Let it
fly… FLY…! fly. YES! G0000D! Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a
glint of pain on his face. He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette -
a full stick deteriorates into ashes before our eyes. And outside, it
rains like there’s no tomorrow.</p>
<p>****: I don’t need you walking me to school. Mary clasps her ears -
deaf.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: not listening .Lalalala…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I got the only mother does this. in the world
that I’m not lisMARY g. Lalalala..,</p>
<p><strong>rd floor - day</strong>: A light beam. It dances over the
consoles of H H orns holsters i-fi’s televisions , his flashli ht ,
stereo floor. He take and mores ’ across the s s the stairs g - down.
howrooms Horus passes the second floor.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: stoops, on a stool and in a deep from his
mou th over his saturated ssleeve. A line of SALIVA dangles The badge
and uniform reveal employee. Roheim another U-Rent Secu Co. is your
uncle lostjck sexuallytdeviant as threatening as a burnt-outmat and</p>
<p><strong>chstick</strong>: Horns stands over Roheim’s slumpne ss.
Removes a from his own pocket. handkerchief</p>
<p>****: Roheim.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Olga…</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Roheim. Let’s go home. Roheim stirs…</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: . bitch. From the dark recesses of sleep -
he wakes. Straightens up. Slurps back his dignity.</p>
<p>****: What, already? Takes the handkerchief. Wipes his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I just made the last run. He helps the old
man to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: You’re a good man.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: it’s about responsibility… with what is
empowered in you… to correct the ills of man. No foam. No gel. Just skin
and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE - it slices through stubble,
clearing up a face that has yet to sleep.</p>
<p>****: it’s about responsibility… Hancock reaches into the cabinet
below the sink - pulls out a BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner… On the
tube, the commercial segues way into…</p>
<p>****: And on the world front, heavy fighting continues in Angola as
rebel forces storm… regime… under the military stronghold… The SOUND of
machine guns CRACKLE amidst mortar explosions and civil destruction.
Hancock listens - it disturbs him. He whirls around, accosts the TV Rips
it from the wall, throws it out the window. And a CRASH eradicates
images of war and chaos. He returns to the bathroom. To the mirror.
Proceeds to spray his teeth with 409…</p>
<p><strong>emporium.</strong>: From the street, notice the display
windows - all mannequins come complete with outfit and ultra-erect
nipples. As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus
and Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk. Roheim unscrews the
battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a swig from its hollow
interior.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: I’ll just play out the rest of this Eight
Ball… He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries
from his jacket.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: like that. Horus looks on - silent.</p>
<p><strong>rutger.</strong>: Boys… The cops smile at one another. A
large SHOTGUN rests fully erect between them. And they drive off. Horus,
watching them go, focuses in on the</p>
<p><strong>“to serve and protect”</strong>: of their vehicle. Roheim
watches him - turning red with drama.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Bastards… couldn’t protect a pitcher of warm
spit… couldn’t find their asshole with common sense and a thumb.</p>
<p>****: Like I been saying, it’s their.loss. The jerk-offs, they don’t
got the heart… the sensitivity of a man like you. Horus tries to shrug
off these words. No good - they stick like a thorn in the eye of his
soul.</p>
<p>****: Come on, let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>bradley elementary school.</strong>: Schoolyard activities
abound. Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards of screaming little
anti-christs.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the
latter trying to pull ahead and away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Will you slow down.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I know it. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I think I’m… slow down… I’m gaining weight.
Honey, take a look at my waist.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is my dress too tight?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What? Nothing. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Really, my waist isn’t too big?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What? Not here, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n’t
leave the building till then. I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I know it, mom. Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Give me a kiss, you snot.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Geez! He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary’s
smiling cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Two-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: All right, mom. He leaves, merging into the
undulating sea of children.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You want anything from the store? He’s
gone.</p>
<p>****: Longfella. Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Clyde… Clyde shoves the remains of the paper
at Horus - in his face.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Picked this up for you. Say thanks.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You’re a good man.</p>
<p><strong>rainstorm hits sheepshead. no end in sight.</strong>: Horus
checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers inside.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re sweet, Nick. He cracks a wet smile.
Mary, aware, unhands the artichoke. Moves on.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey, what’s the idea? The man turns. Smiles.
His smile fades, turning into a maniacal. grin. This man is TOM , as
plainly evil as the eye can see.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You know what, you remind me of my grandma. Tom
whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants…</p>
<p>****: She gave me this when I made parole. He aims the barrel in her
face.</p>
<p>****: Thanks, Granny! Of course, by now, people have realized the
implications of the situation at hand. They begin to panic. On cue, two
new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY , emerge from the crowded bank, both
revealing automatic RIFLES. Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the
butt of his gun. As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS
on each end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom’s chagrin.
The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues. The Jerrys
try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with ,Ir► that, Tom takes
center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain
speaking. My name is Tom. These are my assistants, Jerry and Jerry.
Why’re we doing what we’re doing, you ask? We got one word to say to you
folks… Recession.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. bank - day</strong>: Order in the bank - employees and
patrons are now corralled at the center of the bank. Their faces all
register pain. And we find out why… They all squat in the LOTUS position
- legs crossed like pretzels.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thank you, Jerry. Tom is referring to Jerry’s
demonstration of the lotus Jerry does not respond.</p>
<p>****: Thank you, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry #2</strong>: I’m stuck. Mary, amongst the crowd,
watcheson withinterest.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: And while I take care of business, my
associates will be making their rounds. The Jerrys leap into action -
guns pointing. They rummage the helpless patrons for jewelry, cash and
collectables.</p>
<p>****: Please be cooperative and more importantly, charitable. We’d
like you to think of it as donations… for Jerry’s kids. Jerry #2 weaves
through crowd waving his automatic wand. People dish out valuables into
his canvas BAG. He arrives at Mary, motioning at the bag with the
rifle.</p>
<p>****: I have no money.</p>
<p><strong>jerry #2</strong>: Come on, is. What the hell you doing in a
bank if you.got no money?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m here to withdraw money. This stumps the
brainless beast. And over by the teller, while he’s stuffing her
bag…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t hate me ’cause I’m beautiful. She’s too
scared for speech. But back on the bank floor…</p>
<p><strong>jerry #2</strong>: Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No heroes! No heroes! Jerry #2 returns, bad
news on his tongue.</p>
<p><strong>jerry #2</strong>: He flew! Fucking Fred flew!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fuck! Fuck! A wave of SIRENS punctuate their
state of “fuck.” It crescendoes around the building.</p>
<p>****: Wow, S.W.A.T.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m not going back. Mary, amongst the crowd,
takes a glance at the CLOCK –one thirty.</p>
<p>****: Time’s running out, fellas. He turns to his sidekick, CHAD , a
fellow cop. Chad’s on the phone deliberating an important call.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The pizza here, yet?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Negative. Tami.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Ooh, one sec. Time’s… all Hell’s gonna break
loose, fellas. My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo… A BLAST rings out from
Central Fidelity. Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security
guard, tumbles out and onto the sidewalk. Blood and brain exits in OOZES
where the bullet had entered - he’s probably dead.</p>
<p>****: I’m not gonna say it again, Ted! swiss cheese. All of them!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Time’s running out, fellas! The hostages
grimace, hell not so far away.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I want that car, Ted!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Where’s that car, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: It’s out getting your pizza.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: . a car and I want it NOW! And on this cue, the
sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a CAR comes CRASHING down
before the bank entrance. It came from the clouds and it looks familiar
- it’s the getaway Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its
hubcaps still reeling from the impact. The sky answers again, this time
with the tattered body of FRED, the getaway driver Fred lands on the
hood of the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame. SHOCK waves across
faces of stone. The cops all look up.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What the…</p>
<p>****: Everybody out, please. Bodies bang about, all moving for the
door.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Stay away. Hancock does not respond.</p>
<p>****: I’m not going back. Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams
it shut with a resounding THUD. They’re locked in.</p>
<p>****: What’re you doing? Hancock does not respond.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s going on, here? Hancock no response. Tom
raises his gun, and meaning it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Answer me! Say something!</p>
<p>****: Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Why’d you go and do that for? Tom retrieves
his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back, clutching his head. He
bleeds.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fuck… My shirt.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Why don’t we call it the day.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t. I told you… I’m not going back.</p>
<p>****: If you’re going to tease, cock the damn gun. Otherwise, spare
me the wounded animal act of desperation. I don’t got c, time for
rhetoric and sympathy so. don’t expect… dialogue and “come with me and
you won’t be hurt” bullshit. You walk out of here with me and your life
is a violent storm. You will be hurt, you will be abused… whatever turns
them on. Either way, your days are shit! Those are the realities,
spelled out.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s eating you, man?</p>
<p>****: You got half the precinct out there, armed, trained to blow the
tail off a sperm from a hundred yards… you’re standing in here,
cornered, three bullets left in that squirter of yours, if you’re lucky,
and you got one ear. I don’t need the aggravation. I don’t need
this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Man, you’re jaded. I’m not asking for a
rainbow…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: you don’t got to shower me with respect. Just a
little.. tenderness, is all. Have you no mercy, mister?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I’m all out. Let’s go… And as he utters
this, he approaches Tom.</p>
<p>****: Fuck you. Close on his trigger finger. It tightens…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tell me… what happened?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You were late.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I was held up…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The asshole peed on me. I’m dog shit.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: .at the bank. Honey, were they the same ones?
Don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both
storming through the entrance and up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: How was your day? Mother and son - if eyes
could disembowel.</p>
<p>****: People ignore me. From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE
swarm below in his honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a
building window across the street.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Mr. Fisher.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: You’re not unattractive.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Baldness is not fatal.</p>
<p><strong>jumper</strong>: My wife ignores me.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Your wife’s a cunt, Mr. Fisher.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
acknowledge you, we all do.</p>
<p><strong>jumper</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jumper</strong>: Really? The secretary SCREAMS. All attention
shifts to the BUILDING across the street. The secretary points…</p>
<p><strong>news</strong>: . paramedics have taken the rescued tenants to
County General for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries reported
thanks to the superheroics of this mystery man…</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary? Mary blinks back her attention.</p>
<p>****: Why is he mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s looking for answers. He’s Upset.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Let me see your eye… I told him about the
other cheek. Avoid confrontations… to turn the other cheek.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: .He did. He turned the other cheek and they
punched it.</p>
<p>****: Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re late. I’ll try again later. Horus finds
his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She’s
glued to the set.</p>
<p><strong>horus ’</strong>: How… what about you?</p>
<p>****: What? Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE.
He watches Mary.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>.horus</strong>: I… had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What could you do? Horns - hat in hand, goes
to the door. He wants to stay.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Good thing he was there. I don’t know what
I’d do… if you… Mary does not hear him… until the door SHUTS behind her.
She turns to face an empty room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Coffee’s by the… door.</p>
<p>****: Horus?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh god. The man surfaces from her cleavage
for air, his face wet with sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away
from his arm. Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
breasts beckoning at ceiling. Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his
pants. Unlatches the window. She paws after him.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What’d I do?</p>
<p>****: ’Nothing. I’m sorry. And with that, he floats out into the
night.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hancock.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: Nutri-cop. Horus keeps walking.</p>
<p>****: Look like the Man. Walk like the Man. Shit, ain’t half the
Man.</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Ain’t half the Man. Horus simply walks
away.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How about spreading some of that joy? Hancock
turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own slimy kind of way.
In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a gun to
Hancock’s temple.</p>
<p>****: Better yet, why don’t I just take it… Hancock - enraged. In a
caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by the throat via one arm, the gun
with the other.</p>
<p>****: What are you thinking? The Hoodlum notices that he’s dangling a
foot off the ground - one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the
swift jolt. The other sneaker teeters on his one foot… and falls to the
pavement.</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the
gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside.
The Hoodlum FREAKS.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Huh?! Takes the smoking gun out of his
mouth. Shoves it up the- Hoodlum’s nose.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Want to see brain? Huh?! Sticks the gun
back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside. Takes it out and this
time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth. The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate
in his pants.</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
wife. I got student loans… Hancock - intense. Is this getting
through?</p>
<p>****: please. Have a heart, mister. Hancock - the fire inside
subsides. Cools to a rational state. He lowers the. Hoodlum. He spits
the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the Hoodlum’s breast
pocket. Walks away.</p>
<p>****: You’re still up.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Can’t sleep. He rolls over the sofa, next to
his mother. They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the
crashing Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this
man.</p>
<p>****: That’s him?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There’s something about him… I don’t know. A
female REPORTER concludes the footage…</p>
<p>****: And so we ask… who is this man? Speculation abounds -
government super- experiment, an aberration of nature, or
extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you? Where are you now, superguy?
Call me.</p>
<p>****: We’ll get together. Have a drink.</p>
<p>****: What he’s got to do… a man’s got to do it.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: You’ve been to Hell, it looks. And you’re
tired…</p>
<p>****: and in need. Hancock - his eyes agree. The Whore lifts her
skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes out a MATCHBOOK. Hands it to
him.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: My business card. My office. Hancock inspects
the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.</p>
<p>****: Gina.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: Gina.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Just a quick one.</p>
<p><strong>’aaron</strong>: Don’t 3±119.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I want to.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Once there was a way, to get back homeward.
Once there was a way, to get back home.”</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I will
sing a lullaby…”</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles awake
you when you rise.” Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike
him.</p>
<p>****: “Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I will sing a lullaby…”
And like that, a seamless fade into peace - he sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>erlick</strong>: He’s not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>spengler</strong>: ’Less he can walk through wall.</p>
<p><strong>erlick</strong>: Fuck… squeeze through brick.</p>
<p><strong>perceval</strong>: Let’s rock it up. They turn the corner,
attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just the brick wall and a trash
can. They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
scratches his head. But’Perceval’s no fool. He spots the trash can. He
motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They ATTACK… an
empty can. No one inside. Nothing. That’s because above them, no strings
and no cables, Aaron hovers - under Hancock’s capable arm. In mid-air,
they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No… no… no!</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You smoke?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Of course you don’t. Nothing but a kid.
Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Ever curious… .what it’s like? Aaron shakes
his head.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Go on… give it a try. One time. Won’t kill
you. Once. Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks
on it. Doubles over, coughing.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Good, huh? Tastes like compost… your first
stick. Then, after a few more… it starts getting this. flavor. A little
nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of a sudden, it’s as sweet as
candy. Only now, it takes a whole pack to get there.., and you won’t
settle till your, mouth’s as sweet. Hancock takes another cool drag -
Mr. Wisdom waxing philosophical.</p>
<p>****: From manure to pure cane sugar. That’s change. Today… you’re a
boy. Tomorrow, Mr. Penis comes knocking. Shakes your hand. Takes you for
a walk… and tells you about life’s simple pleasures. You’re a man. And
you don’t look back..</p>
<p>****: You see… things evolve. Nothing is wholly inert. A step in any
direction… you’re walking into pockets of evolution. That is living…
taking those steps. And change. Can start by changing some principles.
Blank best describes Aaron’s face.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Principles?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Principles. Here’s one; very simple. Just
about all you need to know: a man’s got to do what a man’s got to do. I
look at your face, the shiners. You took a shove and you let it go
clean. Not good. That’s a formula for future abuse… an invitation to the
loser’s dance. Letting it go. Walking away. , Bad policy. Won’t be long
’fore you’re running, looking for a place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What am I suppose to do?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You do what is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I wanted… there were three of them.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What is necessary.</p>
<p>****: Let me tell you something, kid. There was this infantry unit,
you see… badly outnumbered. Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
relate, OK? There’s a fox, you relate? A fox and he’s walking through
what, the woods, the forests, right? Next thing the fox knows, he’s
staring down a pack of… hounds. Bloodhounds. And there’s this chase, the
fox’s running his ass off, over boulders and through streams and, but
the damn hounds are still on his tail. Finally the fox comes to this
cliff, a precipice… and it’s what, a seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
rocks. He’s in trouble ’cause the hounds are closing in and they’re
going to tear him to pieces. So what does he think… “I jump and I die
for sure. I stay, confront them and I’ll get my ass butchered.” Decision
time. He thinks, “stay and least I’d have something, a chance.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: To slip away, maybe.” The fox decides to go
down fighting, make a stand. Right?</p>
<p>****: The hounds come. What do you think happens?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He gets away. Hancock inhales what’s left of
his cigarette. Blows smoke.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No. The fox gets his ass kicked and some… I
mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What’re you saying?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: But you know, when the last hound was
through with him,-and he’s walking away, he hears this noise. It’s the
fox and he’s muttering something under his breath… words. The dog goes
over. Gets up close. To hear what he’s saying. You know what the fox’s
saying… just before he keels off? Aaron - negative.</p>
<p>****: Now he’s gurgling, choking on his own blood, right? A massacre.
The fox’s lying next to his entrails, you know… and you know what he
says? “No regrets.”</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No regrets. You make a decision and you
stick to it. Like a man’s got to do. And “no regrets.” Aaron -
submitting it to memory.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Why’re you telling me all this?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Look at it this way… I got to do what I got
to do.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hole</strong>: at the Hole Institute, our experienced
staff and cutting-edge technology means you need not spend another day
in discomfort from hemorrhoidal flare-ups. Also, for anal fissures,
warts, and secondary yeast infections, the institute is your complete
rectal service clinic.</p>
<p>****: And remember, I’m not just the Hole Institute spokesperson. I’m
also a client. As Dr. Hole proceeds to exhibit an enlarged PHOTOGRAPH of
his hemorrhoidal tissues, the TV channel changes. A NEWS program, in
progress.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: . more.on the neighborhood robberies in
our next hour.</p>
<p>****: World news, today. Hundreds are believed dead when an explosion
ripped through a crowded market place in… Hancock staring into footages
of bedlam, bloodshed. From the TV set, maternal CRIES spew forth grief
and anguish. Hancock grabs the remote. Fumbles around for the power
button. He pumps the volume instead - the WAILS intensify his state of
panic, pain. CLICK. Mary - by the tube, switches off the mayhem. She
studies his reaction, now marked with relief.</p>
<p>****: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p>****: I came in to… hope you like chicken. Hancock nods, watching
Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He continues to stare - at
Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping for dinner. She catches him
looking… looking surreal, this superman, there on her sofa. A calm,
while they stare. And then…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Table’s done. Mary turns to Aaron,
offscreen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Glasses.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Geez. Horus enters from the hallway,
disheveled from sleep. He does not see the superman on his sofa. He
continues into the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know Hancock?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He comes for dinner. Close on Hancock. Close
on Horus.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Man of the house?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Which piece would you like?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Breasts, please. Horus, watching everything
- Mary and her every blush.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You want milk?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No. It gives me gas. Thank you. A beat - as
everyone visualizes a superFART.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It makes mom fart, too. Mary CHOKES on her
food. Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the
utensil - and finding difficulty. Hancock grabs the table, one arm.
Lifts it off the carpet and above everyone’s head. Mary, startled,
impressed, all of the above. She picks up the fork.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Good arm.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: not about the labor… or the love of it.
.It’s about responsibility… with what is empowered in you. The gift of
might. Might to.do what? Exploitation, because you can? Or a different
path. To purvey justice. To correct the ills of man… because I can.
Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are charmed, his
words secondary to his charisma. Horus, the quiet observer,
observes.</p>
<p>****: so, a job? Yes. And no. It’s about… essence. The essence of the
man… not his clothes. It’s the job. Take away the arm,. the leg…, his
bodily possessions but not his trade, his profession. That case, you
strip him of what he is… a man. Horus a firm grasp of the concept.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What line of work are you in,
Mr. Longfellow?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Oh, it’s not like you… what you do or
anything. A department store over on Third.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Horus is in the securities business.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I’m a security guard. I’m just…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s a large department store, over a couple
million in merchandise… stereos, jewelry. On three floors.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: It’s a night job. I sit around.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You’re a security guard. You keep the state
of things. It’s a job. You do it.</p>
<p>****: We’re in the same business. Aaron returns with the ketchup
bottle. A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares
at the BOTTLE.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Aaron, could you show me the restroom?
Aaron points first door in the hall.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: On the right. He leaves to find bladder
relief - leaving Horus to his family.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What do you think, mom?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Horus, what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I need to get ready.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: mom?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What do I do with him… when you’re gone? I
have to entertain this super… She doesn’t finish her… A NOISE interrupts
her - seizes the participants.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: and you could see the flames, through the
storm… I get there, the vessel’s all over, spread across three miles of
South Pacific. Bodies floating in the water, shoes, kids who’d thought
it some routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns out, the only one alive
was the captain, up against a buoy… crying ’cause he didn’t go down with
his men… and he’s got to live with it.</p>
<p>****: Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard in a parking lot a
couple months after. A good man… . did what he had to do. A brief moment
while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron’s smitten. Mary, a
mixture of repulsion and fascination.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I wanted to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense
up… like I can’t even move.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He comes home crying.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.</p>
<p>****: No… there’s no shame in it. The crying. It’s relief… we’re
older and we don’t remember when… we go, “God, when was the last time?”
Maybe it’s me. It’s more an effort, now. Takes more pain… more blood.
Like it’s, do you have the time anymore? Even to look back and recall a
moving experience. To be moved.</p>
<p>****: By rage. Hurt.</p>
<p>****: By love.</p>
<p>****: But if you have to remember the last time something touched
you… you’ve missed it - you’ve forgotten how to cry. Horus enters the
room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this magic Hancock works over his
wife and kid - a talent whose nature he has yet to comprehend. Horus
opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door. Hancock - holds
him accountable.</p>
<p>****: Mr. Longfellow. I’ll be leaving, too.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Oh, I… you don’t have to leave. I don’t want
to interfere. I have work.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into
the kitchen. Horus stops her.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: It’s all right, Mary. I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, I’ll make it right now.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I don’t have time. I’ll grab some on the way.
Thanks. Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.</p>
<p>****: I don’t want to interrupt. Please don’t let me stop you.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No, I need to go. The last time I had a
meal… an evening like this, I was… it was too long ago. I appreciate
your kindness.</p>
<p>****: Please… you’re welcome, here. Anytime. Horus watches everything
- watching her chest heave under Hancock’s every word, watching his wife
slip away.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I’ll drop
by after school. See how you’re doing.</p>
<p>****: Yeah. Horus watches this - his son slipping away. The two men
leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first. Mary closes the door behind
them. Leans against the door and EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair,
or, of a heart raging wild. We just .don’t know.</p>
<p>****: I’m this way. Hancock points the opposite way.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: It’s a short walk. Acknowledged. An awkward
beat while they stare at each other… . until finally, they go their
separate ways - Horus via walk and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via
flight. From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.</p>
<p>****: bleeding heart dyke, I know not what. Fuck martyrdom. Bottom
line, Sheila won’t put out…</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: . won’t blow me…</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: Shit stinks.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: says I’m keeping poontang on the side.</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: D’fuck she know? Shit smears, man.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: Games. I don’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: Fuck games, fuck dames.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: I got a’wife, I don’t need the
aggravation…</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: Take a donut hole. The entrance. Horus
wanders in, lost in this environment. He finds the front counter. The
cops watch him.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: A cup of coffee, please. Holly takes the
order. Leaves to fetch it.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: How are you, John?</p>
<p>****: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: Observe anything worth recording, lately?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: You know… things are slow.</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: Not for Samsone Electronics on fifth. Got
hit on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: The guard, he was cut-up like a piece of
meat.</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: Anything go wrong, you make sure you notify
us, the authorities. No heroics without a license. You know the
procedure. Horus - he knows the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: Of course he does.</p>
<p><strong>rutger</strong>: Of course. Holly returns with the coffee.
Hands it to Horus - free of charge. From the back, Soon-yi
intervenes…</p>
<p><strong>soon-yi</strong>: He no have gun. Not copper.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, I thought…</p>
<p><strong>soon-yi</strong>: He regular guy. Sixty-five cents for
regular.guy. Horus - somebody shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’re you doing? She’s taken by this
scene.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed.
Sits.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: About him?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No. Not really. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. They’re lying through their collective
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Me neither. I was thinking.., about
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow
always feels better…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I know, mom… after a good night sleep. He
says that but he’s the one working every night. Does that mean he never
feels better? He’s always feeling terrible?</p>
<p>****: Go to bed, anyway. She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And
as she’s out the door…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Mom? She turns.</p>
<p>****: Who is Mr. Penis?</p>
<p><strong>news</strong>: .the trains seemed imminently bound for a
catastrophic collision when this… this superguy…</p>
<p>****: Man. I bet he gets laid. Horus - he looks terrible.</p>
<p><strong>children… dead…</strong>: . we SCREAM!</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Olga… He snaps out of it…</p>
<p>****: .bitch. Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch,
then the area around him. He spots Horus - slumped in a chair, in a
thinking posture. Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Another dream?’</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: I was talking again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: . that look on her face, you know the look,
when she’s almost there… makes you feel like a man.</p>
<p>****: Then everything gets blurry and all of a sudden, it’s not my
arm that’s around her and it’s not my hand that’s touching her and it’s
not even me, my body. Some guy, this good-looking guy… he looks like the
Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And so… the Marlboro Man’s running his
fingers through her hair. And he’s… banging her… and her knees… by her
ears, you know? And that look on her face. That look.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Roheim.</p>
<p>****: Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I got to do what I got to do. She watches him
go -curious.</p>
<p>****: This stuff’s going to kill me. He gives Horus a glance. Takes
another swig.</p>
<p>****: You disapprove, I know.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you
allow me to drink… to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of
caution. Not a word. Just take it… you take everything.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: You’re afraid to offend. You don’t want to
be abrasive. Provocative. So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim
takes another gulp.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: You shouldn’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: My wife. She left a bad taste in my mouth. I
drink to kill-the taste. Horus has no response to this.</p>
<p>****: You’re a good man, Horus…</p>
<p>****: And you’re right. This stuff’s no good. It’s a coward’s way out
and I know it. He gives the bottle a guilty stare. Tosses the bottle
into a nearby garbage can.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: What the hell. I can learn to love
beverage.</p>
<p><strong>scream.</strong>: Hancock warbles out from the debris - his
trenchcoat reduced to mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the
rubble. Looks at Mary, reposed before him.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: How are you? In unison, they turn to the
UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of steel, STEAM billowing from its
ruptured radiator. Hancock shrugs a smiles.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief
moment?</p>
<p>****: Not now, Longfella. I’m all blocked up. Clyde heads inside -
with the sports page.. He FARTS as he goes in.</p>
<p>****: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What were you doing in the street? You ripped
it pretty good.</p>
<p>****: What’re you:.. how old’s this thing?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: didn’t see it coming… left myself open.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: All right?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s just the seams. I can sew it back.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This. It’s just the seams.’I’ll take good care
of it.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You’ll sew -it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. Me. I can. And I’ll re-button it for you,
all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.</p>
<p>****: Are you okay? No reply. He stares at her - simply.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You have to be quick.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Come on, I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: If you blink, you’ll miss it. Hancock
uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white something - it hangs
in the air, and then dissipates into moisture. It showers into his open
hands. Mary reaches for it. Too late.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers
into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her
fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this -
the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at
her hand… at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls her hand away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The water is dirty.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s not your fault.</p>
<p>****: You’re tense.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I’ve been tired, lately.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You should slow down. Rest.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: -So people tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It must be hard.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Hard?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: To always do right… do good when all you want
to do is rest.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: It’s harder to not do anything. What am I?
It’s not for me. It’s for… it is about people. Rest? When there is
despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am relief. You know that instant,
that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare… the
totality of fear itself… that it’s all been a bad dream? That it’s safe?
That is relief. The infant in my arms… to the hysterical mother. When
you can see her face, what’s rest? It is self-indulgence. Mary - in some
advance stage of “wow.”</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where… who are you?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: It’s not important who I am, Mary. Or what…
where I’m from. It doesn’t matter. I’m a man. I am every man.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You probably get a lot of practice explaining
yourself, on account of who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Why… do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s like, everything you say sounds… so
perfect. Like you rehearse them so they’ll be that way. I mean, not to
say that it’s insincere…</p>
<p>****: I mean, maybe it’s something about you but… it must be hard on
you sometimes. Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to
answer.</p>
<p>****: But probably not… probably..</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Yes… sometimes. Mary allows the moment to
sink in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: So, you never answered. Back there… what were
you doing in the middle of the street?</p>
<p>****: I was lost…</p>
<p>****: . but I think I’m ok, now.</p>
<p>****: ” before long, you’re running, looking for a place to
hide.”</p>
<p><strong>perceval</strong>: Shit, I’m not climbing this. Just combed
my hair. Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
eyes are of disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>perceval</strong>: What’s up? What? Perceval follows their
gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering with clenched fists.</p>
<p><strong>perceval</strong>: I just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler
make for the fence, to join the fray.</p>
<p><strong>perceval</strong>: Don’t bother. He’s mine. No biting. I hate
biting.</p>
<p><strong>spengler</strong>: Kick his ass, Percy.</p>
<p>****: Do him, Percy. He’s your woman.</p>
<p><strong>perceval</strong>: Let’s go. Let’s have it. While we’re still
kids. Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.</p>
<p><strong>perceval</strong>: Dick wad, let’s go. Come on, you impotent
little gonad.</p>
<p>****: Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny, purple-headed shlongs
the size of… All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose. And the
pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing BLOWS to the
face and body. Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts
at air, left and right…</p>
<p><strong>erlick</strong>: He’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>spengler</strong>: Save some for us. Someone blinks - and
Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine. Perceval looms over him,
silhouetted against the sky. He reaches for his zipper, doing that
Perceval-thing. A look of recognition in Aaron’s eyes - it’s going to
rain soon. He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
into Perceval’s peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
fellow’s mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag. Erlick. Spengler. Shock.
Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet, ready to book… but he doesn’t. He
stays.</p>
<p><strong>erlick</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>spengler</strong>: Kick his ass, Percy. Aaron stares at them,
behind the fence. Then down at Perceval fetal position, mouth agape.
Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP, revenge presents itself.</p>
<p><strong>erlick</strong>: That’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>spengler</strong>: Kill him, Percy. Aaron cranes himself over
Perceval’s face, over his open oral orifice. Contemplates his target.
Aaron - to pee or not to pee… ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Don’t mess with me. He struts out of the
alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline taking him away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re still up? She moves behind the bathroom
door. Self-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Just get in? Mary steps out of the bathroom,
buttoning up her domestic attire. She nods affirmatively.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nick’s market. Are you sick?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I can’t sleep. She goes to the bed. Palms his
forehead with her right. Palms her own with the left, as reference.
Horus tilts his head away from her hand.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Please, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You want some milk? I’ll heat it up for you,
how about that?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p>****: Aaron, today? This Hancock ’s picking up</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling
with the words. Mary continues dressing - oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: He’ll take him home?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: What do we know about this man? The papers…
they don’t have all the facts about him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What facts? He’s not a hero.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Yes. A hero. I know that…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Aaron likes him.</p>
<p>****: I know that maybe, I’ve been neglectful… that I haven’t been
there… Mary does not hear him. She’s at the mirror, fixing her hair.</p>
<p>****: I’m trying… you have to know… I’d like to be more… involved.
Like it used to be. Before we moved here.</p>
<p>****: Are you going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. I have to start on dinner. So how about
that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right. Try to get some sleep. With that,
she’s out the door. Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror
at his wretched face. He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to
inspect. Inside - Hancock’s tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the cover.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: .o his mouth was. open and he just stared up
at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers
through his hair - a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens
concerned.</p>
<p>****: I said, “don’t mess with me.” Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: “Don’t mess with me.” Mom, remember that guy
in the cop movie… he said that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right, already. How’s your mouth?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It doesn’t hurt, I told you.</p>
<p>****: He saw everything from the roof. Said I did what I had to
do.</p>
<p>****: Aaron, tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He said tomorrow, he’d pi ck me up again…</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I thought maybe you’d like it – if I pick
you.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes -
fades back to his meal, unheard.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I like it long.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Horus?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: it’s almost eight. Dad’s late.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves
into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front
door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down
below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him… and they look at
each other.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: like this? How do you make a fist?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up
close, almost between the boy’s eyes. So there it is, the fist - this
petrified mass of knuckles and bones. It SNARLS at Aaron. Hancock holds
it there, fingers locked together - like he can’t let go of them. Aaron
swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hancock? The sound of her voice takes him. He
snaps out of it.</p>
<p>****: turn. Hancock, it’s yo ur</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Your hair. Come on, have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Mom’s going butcher your hair.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n
homework.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
Hancock. Hancock shrugs a “what can I do.”</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I got
to do.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There… my hero. He inspects himself via a hand
MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.</p>
<p>****: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Nice. Thank you. Mary - peripatetic,
putting away things…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I started out just trimming for Horus. Here
and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a
police captain there… in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took
over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: He was in the-police academy? A pause.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: His father’s idea. Not his. He went through it
anyway, like he had something to prove… the validation of his
manhood.</p>
<p>****: It tpok everything out of him. He didn’t talk for days after he
was cut. He took it real hard. I mean, still, he’s not… I mean,, he’s
still… .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I understand that I’m not
intolerant of it, the working-through process. It’s just that,
sometimes… sometimes, I need his strength. I miss. the strength.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Want?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What you need?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The hair… I need to…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p>****: You ever been down the boardwalk, at night?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why… what for? They’re eye to eye. Close.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Mom? Mary bursts from her perch - regroups,
awkwardly. Aaron stands in the hallway, his hair still wet from the
shower.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. Inside Aaron’s head: My mother + Hancock?
Nah!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: my mouth. It’s starting to swell. I think he
loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right. Go to your room. I’ll get the ice
pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He
finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack.
Catches him…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: It’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I’m going to take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Really? On the boardwalk?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Maybe. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Mom.’</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry. She goes to him, without words to
say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with
thought.</p>
<p>****: Good night, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I wear dresses. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Get lost. The warning comes across quite
well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the
other end, the bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Meet you outside. The El Camino, right? The
bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face in her hands,
studies him.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Your eyes are calm. It’s good. She withdraws
her hands.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: But you’re still here. She rises. And as she
makes for the exit…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Nice haircut. Hancock watches as the night
swallows her whole. He inhales the rest of his cigarette - pensive.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Dear God. Horus catches him.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Jesus. Goes to the bathroom sink for some
paper towels. Comes back to nurse’ the wounds.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Figured I can get you by the front… but you
weren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Who… what happened?</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and his
boys. They were waiting on me. Returns to get more clean towels. And
comes back.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Why didn’t you come through the back…
standing out there in the dark?</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: -Couldn’t find my keys. Must’ve dropped
them’in the fight. Shit… He works himself off the chair. Heads inside
the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: the old man Look at what they did.. gave a
fat lip to match his big mouth. I’m for shit.</p>
<p>****: Sit down Could you knock it off, please. so I can clean the
cuts. He leads the old wretch back to the chair.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: I’m a waste of time…</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: I’m too old for this.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: You’re not old.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: What am I… I’m biologically challenged. Any
way you look, I’m a waste of effort.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Use to be, I blame the job. The job. think,
bullshit job. Not right for a man. “To observe and record…” I say, what
a t’s for the hell is DIo nly dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn
reason we’re he d re, we don’t shit on the carpet. Horus looks away.
Doesn’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>****: But you know what, Horus. That’s all wrong. It ain’t the job.
The job don’t make the man. It’s me. Not the uniform. It starts right
here… ’cause I can’t do anything right. Fuck up my ABC’s. But you. Why
do you put up with this crap? A wife. A kid. There… waiting for you at
home. Horus - he just doesn’t know anymore.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: got to do what you got to do. He paces with
nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other hand. We sense a
decision brewing…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I know you’re up, Mary. I know you can hear
me. Please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning. Nine o’clock. It’s
important that I talk to y ou, then.</p>
<p>****: Please, Mary. And with that, he’s off and away. Mary.-
stunned.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: They’re going to can me.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: No one’s canning anyone. No one saw us… watch
your step… leave.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Should be an extra key over the door.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The toast’s burnt.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What? Aaron inspects his Superman
lunchbox.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: We’re late… you forgot the corn chips. Mary
serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down… and all over the
place.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Eat… and we’ll go. Where’s your father? She
grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron’s hair.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You forgot the corn… . ouch!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m’sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy’ll be
home before we leave. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You having your period, mom? She responds
with a brisk slap to the head… SMACK.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Shoes. The two pause. Remove their shoes.
Proceed into bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: You’re going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: I don’t know. You might have solo act
tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: You’re a good man, Horus.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I have to get home, now. I’ll call. Roheim
grabs on to his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: You know what Olga said before she walked
out on me? Her last words to me. She turned at the front door. Looked
around the room and she says, “keep it clean.” That’s it, can you
believe it? Then out the door.</p>
<p>****: But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place spotless… in case she walks
through that door one day. I don’t think she’s coming back.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: The box scores are waiting and I got an inch
of meat sticking out of my ass. Make it snappy.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I’d like my sports page, please.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I want you to stop taking my sports page.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: All right. Clyde closes the door. Horus -
thunderstruck. He stutter-steps… KNOCKS…</p>
<p>****: What’s the matter, you deaf? I’ll stop taking your sports page.
Now get out of here and let me…</p>
<p>****: I want today’s sports page.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: That there… my sports page.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What’s gotten in to you? All of a sudden? You
don’t even like football. Horus does.not budge.</p>
<p>****: You’ll get it back… after I take my dump. Clyde proceeds to
close the door… but Horus interjects, his foot in the door.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: No. I would like my sports page now.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: After I finish.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I’d prefer it now.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What’s eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde’s arm a
kamikaze move, indeed.</p>
<p>****: Give that back. Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a
punch into Clyde’s midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Why’d you go and do that for? Clyde belts up
has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the massacre commences. He simply
tears into Horus… SLOWS to the stomach… RIGHTS across the face. It ends
quickly and without resistance - as if Horns accepted it as fate.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Are you all right, mom?</p>
<p>****: Yeah… why?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You’re acting weird.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m late for class. Go home, mom. I think
it’s time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk… to
the boardwalk.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary! A deaf ear. No one’s there to console
him. He storms out of the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Come back here! Stop him! In the background, a
COP commences pursuit on a THIEF. The thief dashes by - pass an
indifferent Hancock. The cop follows suit, passing by.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Stop him! Hancock - his gaze wavers not from
the distant waters.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Drink. The bartender comes out, considers
this man’s appearance.</p>
<p>****: Is this a bar… or what? Drink.</p>
<p>****: Please.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>****: Thank you for being here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is everything all right?</p>
<p>****: What’s wrong?</p>
<p>****: It’s cold. Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good
together.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: They’re moving. The turbulence has
started.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tell me what’s wrong. He points to the distant
ocean - where the horizon curves into darkness.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Look out there and what do you see,
Mary?</p>
<p>****: Nothing. I don’t know… I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: see it,can It’s out there. But you can’t Y
nu? And that’s good, not seeing. But for me, I’ve seen it. It’s where
I’m from… out there.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please, Hancock. What are you talking about?
What’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Duty. You ask a man, Mary, and he’ll tell
you. He’ll say: “you do what you have to do.” Or what? You let the next
guy do it for you, if you don’t… if you can’t. And… but. If I can’t,
then who?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: The next guy? No. There is no “I can’t.”
Just “I must.” Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.</p>
<p>****: But I don’t ask, “why me?” I don’t question it. This is me. I’m
it. I do what I have to do. I get in there.., all the killing… the
blood… and I deal with it. I clean up. I make things right.</p>
<p>****: And. But when.., where does it end? Can’t stop the hemorrhage…
it’s everywhere. And it stays. All that I can do, Mary. The things I am
capable of doing, I can’t blink away the hell I’ve seen. It’s in me… in
here and I can’t not think about it. It’s in me. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hancock… what…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I just want to let go, Mary. Or I’ll break.
I need to get away. Get away to where? I don’t know. I need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Me? What can I do? What do you want me to
do?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I want you to save me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How? Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And
kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined… until Mary, composing
her senses, pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don ’ t.</p>
<p>****: Save me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You can.</p>
<p><strong>and</strong>: Mary,-I’ll take you away. And Aaron. what… I’ll
quit. Get a real job. An apartment. I’ll flip burgers. I don’t know what
I’m doing… what I’m saying anymore.</p>
<p>****: I’m married. A pause.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: To whom?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I love him. The death blow.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No. Unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I love him. I’m sorry. One can almost hear
life’s precious air seeping out of this superman - he’d slump over if
not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console… but what can she
do?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I’m cold. Mary hands him the contents of
the bag - the trenchcoat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>plop.</strong>: And that’s the cue for the adjacent stalls -
arms like tentacles surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He
can’t see but, from behind, the stall door opens… Guess who? Perceval -
possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron’s head. Introduces it to the
yellowed waters below. SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron
sees for the next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range. What he hears: the GASPING
of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked laughter. The ambush ends.
Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says…</p>
<p>****: “Don’t mess with me.” They leave - laughing.</p>
<p><strong>them</strong>: Little shit. Left there and in the stall -
Aaron, slumped against the bowl. On the tile floor. A wet rag of
piss.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Horus…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hymie. Come down, Hymie. She catches Hancock,
Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.</p>
<p>****: Mister? My Hymie won’t come down from the tree. Hancock’s
reaction - “what?”</p>
<p>****: My pussycat. She won’t come down. She stares up at him with
big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Holy fuck. Hancock resumes his course, taking
off and into the wet sky.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What do we have here? A piece of shit. A slow
look of recognition seizes his face - this is that superguy. Hancock
stares at him.</p>
<p>****: Fuck off. He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a
glimpse of particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
chase… and confronts him, out of breath.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I saw you walking. Where were you today? You
said you’d… be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron’s abused frame.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Where are you going? Can I go?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You don’t want to go where I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today…
and you said you’d pick me up at school. Hancock turns. He’s upset
now.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Listen. Aaron recoils.</p>
<p>****: Listen. I’m not here to save you.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No, not my job. Don’t put that on me. Not
my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal with it, kid. You are what you are
and… what I say, it won’t do you any change. You’ll grow up to be just
like-your old man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can do about it… ’cept
grab both ankles, hope by the grace of God the reaming’s gentle. Aaron
backs away from his angry wrath.</p>
<p>****: That’s right. Walk away. Me… I’m not here to save you. He
watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed against the
rocks. In Hancock’s eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.</p>
<p>****: One.more. Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill
it…</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: No… nevermind. Where’s your bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Bathroom’s closed. Horus politely stands’-
teeters a bit.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: How much.</p>
<p>****: Let’s see… that’s one beer. Tell you what. I’ll take care of
this one.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: The register ain’t open yet, anyhow. Horus
doesn’t hear him. He’s already on the move, making a dash for the door.
But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I’ve been waiting. They stare for one horny
beat. Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Come on, baby. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You can. The phone begins to RING - but
they’re busy.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Let it go, baby. Just let it…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I can’t. His arm rips through the
glass…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: . go.</p>

out of the booth. Finds the sky.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Son. Go to your room. Struggles to his
knees.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What happened toyou?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Dad, are you wasted?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where… Aaron, he’s not wasted. Go to your
room.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He is wasted. Horus rises, under great
difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa. When Mary tries to assist, he
waves her away.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Aaron. Go to your room.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: But dad…</p>
<p>****: Go! Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What do you think you’re doing, Horus
Longfellow? Horus gauges her.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Don’t “Horus Longfellow” me, Mary. I’m not
your child. I’m your husband.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Horus, what’re you talking about? Who did this
to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.</p>
<p>****: But you didn’t know-about me… Mary knows where this is
headed.</p>
<p>****: You didn’t know I was going to do this to you. I guess I
should’ve known. We were married and I knew… at the reception. I
couldn’t dance. so I sat in the back and watched. You were with Stuart
Olmsted and I watched you dance. In your white dress. And I remember
zoning out… for a second, just watching you. God, Mary… the little girl
next door who used to get into fist fights with her brothers in those
patched-up Toughskins. We met only ’cause the tallest tree in the
neighborhood was in my backyard and you needed to climb it.</p>
<p>****: But that night. God, you looked so beautiful I.had to realize
it… how much I loved you… one more time.</p>
<p>****: You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I remember I’m watching you
there, with him… together like that. You looked good with him, I thought
all of a sudden. Like you belong… better. And as I stared across the
floor, it was the same story with all the guys there, that they were
more right for you.</p>
<p>****: More right because that night, you walked in with the wrong
man.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Because I let you down.</p>
<p>****: I’m a coward. I can’t do anything about it. Look at me, I’m
breaking up in front of you. And God, I fear the day when I’d have to
defend you and Aaron. What do I do, then? What am I if I can’t do that…
my own wife, family? Not a man.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: L are. Did You’re a fool, that’s what you you
think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your
masculine ego and it’s the pressure… the standard’s unreasonable. The
woman, she wants me to part oceans. That’s the kind of bull shit’s made
of. I went w through it…,I was there when the hurt came, when the

<p><strong>dream sequence - somewhere</strong>: EXPLODES into the rage
and fury of an apartment fire. Casualties come in the form of CRIES,
women and children on the v erge of incineration. Hancock’s POV: a
burning hallway, flames spewing from every crevice - we’re walking
through Hell. We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his
cape around him. Bolts through the inferno… as glass SHATTERS… and gas
pipes ERUPT. He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape… only to see
the CHARRED remains of a human BODY… the-CRIES, they continue…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>han000k</strong>: I need a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You what? But you haven’t…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I need a cigarette, goddamn it! He storms
from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t smoke. What’s wrong with you? She
rises after him and into view - it’s no other than the TV reporter, in
the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the door SLAMS shut.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What’re you doing, in there! I’m calli ng
the police. Hancock drops his pants. Straight-arms the wall with his
left. And with his right, latches on to his magnanimous member. Outside
and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed against wood -
listening. So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a
storm. His body convulses under said stimulation. He GROWLS… Cue for the
reporter to back away.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Jesus… Hancock stiffens, in full throttle.
Full. Throttle… up and into a fevered pitch… and BOOM, we hear a He
GROWLS… P baby explosion. The reporter leaps back. Beat. The bathroom
door flies open. Hancock emerges, buttoning his pants. He brushes pass
her. Finds the window… and he’s off with a gush of wind. The reporter
turns back to Looks ins everywhere, in shambles.. nwke . b nd in the

<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Shit.</p>

<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Scream and I blow… oh shit. Hancock in a
foul mood. He brushes the Hoodlum away, sending flesh and bone against
the opposite wall. SNAP goes the landing. The Hoodlum. Dead. Hancock -
realization. He hastens to the body… limp… broken.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No… don’t. No.</p>
<p>****: No! He moves away. Angry. Tired. Drunk. Hancock drops against
the wall, beaten…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Once there was a way, to get back
homeward…”</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: once there was a way, to get back home…” Her
voice grips him. Torments him…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Sleep pretty darling, do no t cry. And I will
sing a lullaby…”</p>
<p>****: Good night, darling. Kisses him.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Thanks, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sleep tight. She leaves. Aaron stops her by
the door.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Mom. Tomorrow always feel bette r.</p>
<p>****: Really?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Mary. Mary launches back, cold. Outside the
window and in frontrof her - Hancock, suspended in air. The blood-red of
his eyes p nothing but bad news. And being so, he EXPLODES through the
glass. Glass rains through trance. n the kitchen, amplifying his e</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Amway, anyone? The pursuit commences -
Hancock steadies after Mary, in retreat around the living room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’re you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners
her.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: It’s the haircut, Mary. I’m pissed! Out of
nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He trampolines on Hancock’s
back, trying to saddle him.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Don’t you fucking touch her! Mary SCREAMS.
Hancock cringes, says…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Shut your mouth. He swats the kid off his
back.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Don’t touch her you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You’re getting on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hancock, please. He reaches down and untangles
Mary from her son - she concedes out of fear for Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No! Mom!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Stay back, Aaron! Hancock takes her away -
like booty. Aaron dangles from his cape, trying to save his mother.. In
vain. The superhero springs into the night - with his woman.</p>
<p>****: Stop grabbing my ass, man. Horus slides out the back, into the
alley. He crosses the street to a phone. Jabs in 911.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Police?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: What I got to do.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: Nutri-cop.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: He got out.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: He’s dead, man.</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: Fuck, we’re dead! What, now?</p>
<p><strong>rutgers</strong>: You did the right thing, Longfellow.</p>
<p>****: I saw four. Presumably armed. Only other way out is through the
back. The cops trade laughs.</p>
<p><strong>rutgers</strong>: Take a hike, Longfella. Get back in your
hole and watch the law kick some ass. Horus, reluctant, returns inside
his building. Rutgers moves to work the speakers - his action preempted
by the other COPS.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: We got something big going down.</p>
<p>****: Shit, all units. What the bell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: Killybegs Textiles. The Cap sounds like he’s
chewing the rag.</p>
<p><strong>rutgers</strong>: Fuck, what do we do with this?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: This is a wrap. Come on, lets roll! All
units.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: I don’t like the smell of this shit.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: They’re taking off…</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Fucking no way.</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: Check this-out, fellas. Scarpo. Thug #1,
#3. They gather around - watching the woman reporter do her thing, at
the scene.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: blocked off the streets. Already, orders
for more substantial fire power have been requested by the
commissioner’s office as police surround the condemned textile building
in an all-out confrontation with Hancock, superhero-
turned-renegade…</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: Fuck, you guys know what this means?</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: We’re off the hook, man.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: The store’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>thug #3</strong>: What about that security guy?</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: He ain’t coming back? In unison - their
FLASHLIGHTS flick on.</p>
<p><strong>adams</strong>: What’s with the Cap? Looks like someone just
fucked his wife, or something. Nervous smiles from the fellas.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: Take the show upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: Behind you! Thug #3 swings around with a
Louisville Slugger - it swipes the 45 from Horus’s hand. Horus “I’m
screwed.” Thug #3 promptly knocks Horus against the BAT rack. Bats roll,
spray the floor. Thug #3 slips hard on his approach, landing heavy on
his head. Thug #2 comes running, gun raised.fa rusCdives for r a goes
oose bat, his swing greeting Thug #2 in the the count. Horus stands over
the two bodies - as surprised as we are.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: Guys? Fuck me. He drops his loot. Heads for
the second floor, cocking his gun.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: again, we believe that this is a hostage
situation. Officials refuse to comment but we believe Hancock has
abducted a woman, the identity of whom we do not yet know… Horus - a
look of horror on his face.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary. He’s off, slowing to a ginger descent
at the stairs. Makes his way down to the second floor… where he is
greeted by a gun NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: You’re starting to piss me off. He pushes
Horus down the remaining steps.</p>
<p><strong>scarpo</strong>: Your move… Horus uncoils an accurate kick to
Scarpo’s groin. Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops.
Horus goes for the gun. A struggle ensues, Scarpo finding Horus to the
side. strength from god knows where. g Takes dead aim with a tremblin
BANG… Horus grimaces… Scarpo drops. .45 Roheim steps forward from the
darkness, the smoking in his hand. Did I get him? Horus. Roheim. They
look at Scarpo.</p>
<p>****: of him. Holy shit. I think I g Roheim notices the unconscious
thugs on the floor. Turns to Horus, measuring him.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: What’re you doing here. ROHEIM ed Mary called
earlier. She was worri about you.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Let the lady go, Hancock. Or all hell’s going
to break loose.</p>
<p><strong>rutgers</strong>: Does he know anything else?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on out! Hancock seizes his ears the bull
horn testing his nerves. He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a
special kind of healing. Hancock closes in - corners her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please. But there’s no denying this superman -
he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her
buttocks.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Please… A sudden burst of anger seizes
Mary. She SCREAMS… STRIKES Hancock across the face.</p>
<p><strong>no!</strong>: He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All HELL’S going to break loose! Hancock
recoils from this noise - in veritable pain. Clutches his ear.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Make it go away, Mary. Mary huddles against
the wall..She watches on, watching him struggle.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You are surrounded. There’s no way out of this
one… NO WAY OUT! Hancock on his knees, tears bubbling inside. He shakes
it off.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: No… do what I got to do. He unloads a
PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I want his balls in a jar… Chad. The others.
They take a good look at him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: in a fucking vice… this is the END of the
line.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m cold.. Hancock does not respond.</p>
<p>****: You’re fighting a lot, right now. I know that.</p>
<p>****: They’re out there waiting for you. It’s like… sometimes.., you
feel like the world’s waiting for you. Expecting. What’s your next move,
they want to know…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: there’s NO ESCAPE!</p>
<p>****: and the responsibility. The duty. You can’t shrug it off.</p>
<p>****: I know that. And I’m sorry. Hancock - a committed stare into
space. Can he hear her?</p>
<p>****: Maybe… if you knew that, that I know. And. That I won’t expect
anything from you. And… there doesn’t have to be a next move. Hancock
turns on this. Stares at her. He rises from the crouch. Mary - back to
wall, on the defensive. He approaches. Stands before her. He reaches
back… and removes his CAPE. He covers Mary, gently shielding her. from
the cold. There is no eye contact.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Where the fuck is Chopper Three?</p>
<p>****: This is a hostage situation, Cap. We’ve got a woman in
there.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fuck the woman, this is Armageddon. I want that
bastard in a body bag. Ted waves a “go-when-ready” sign. The Rifleman
steadies his high- powered weapon… FIRES…</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Go away! Go. Away. The authorities - they
pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops. S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins.
Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of shells
strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of superFLESH. He
stares at them all, invincible.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Let me go you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Let go, you little asabite. Aaron spots
Horus in the hallway…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Dad! He breaks loose - running into his
father’s arms, crying.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m sorry dad. I didn’t know what to do…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Mr. Longfellow…</p>
<p><strong>aaron.</strong>: He’s got mom, dad. He came and took her
away. What do we do, now? Horus - he hasn’t a clue. On the TV - a
graphic depiction of war at Killybegs.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: There’s not much you can do. We’ve got
every man out there, already. I suggest you take your son some place
safe. Let us do our jobs.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m sorry, dad. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I have to go… they need me. He exits.
Roheim enters, out of breath. He notices the nasty, gaping hole in the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: He’s got Mary, Roheim. I got to get her.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: What do you mean, you got to get her?</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: I got to do what I got to do. Aaron stares up
at his father - “did he just say that?”</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at
the screen - oblivious. “What can I do?”</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Brain damage runs in this family or
something? Aaron senses his father’s state of overwhelmness.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the
bloodhounds?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Jesus, Aaron. I don’t want you to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: I need a drink. Aaron, staring at the
massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him. It looks pale but well-fed, healthy.
It Ted’s. Aaron ducks into his father’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What have you dome?</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: I made them go away.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary! Mary responds to her name like a body
to sugar.</p>
<p>****: Horus!</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: The noise…</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Horus!</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please, Hancock. Don’t hurt him. It’ll never
go away. Hancock responds to “it.”</p>
<p>****: If you’ve got anything left… inside… and you do, I know you do…
whatever it was that you felt for me… inside… then you won’t go out
there. He just looks at her.</p>
<p>****: Just let go… and it’ll go away. Please, just let go.</p>
<p>****: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: You ready to rock it up? Horus runs - he
runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock follows, toying with the
man. Horus disappears inside.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Come out, you little shit. A pause in
action - no reply from Horus.</p>
<p><strong>hancock</strong>: Are you a man?! Horus answers… He storms
out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock.
It’s a hit and it BLOWS Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him
inside the brick structure.</p>
<p><strong>horus</strong>: Fuck you. Hancock pries himself loose -
enraged beyond imaginable. He GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there’s
no Horus. Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall loose,
sending it crashing down.., on Hancock. CRUNCH, the concrete rips right
pass Hancock - stuns but does not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt.
Finds Horus down the street. Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He
gets there, over Horus - grabbing him by the collar. With a swift flick,
he sends the family man flying. THUD as his body careens off the
Killybegs wall. He drops to the asphalt below. Horus - in pain,
something broken possibly.</p>
<p>****: No regrets.</p>
<p>****: No mercy. He takes aim…</p>
<p><strong>no!</strong>: Mary SCREAMS in the background… Horns. Hancock.
They turn to witness the de-physicalization of Killybegs Textile. they
begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks… beams… and tear of recent
artillery. Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It
slips… she SCREAMS… and collapses, taking the rest of the building with
it. A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke. Mary is no
more.</p>
<p><strong>mary!</strong>: Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.</p>
<p>****: Mom… Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock,
limping over to the building that once was.</p>
<p><strong>mary!</strong>: Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose
silence, looking pale. Horus charges the building in possessed
hysterics, trying to excavate his wife - one brick at a time. Roheim
meets him there, in an effort to console.</p>
<p><strong>roheim</strong>: Come on, Horus. Horus - lost in the pain. He
won’t listen. Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the
excavation. He r olls up his sleeve and gets to work. Hancock drops the
yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his midst… surveys the carnage…
A loaded beat. Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with
defeat. Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
knees… by a fallen police GUN.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: sometimes when it’s dark out, so dark it’s
black, I’ll see HIM. Aaron peers through the open door. His eyes wander
inside ever so gently. On the bed there - HIM… Horns.</p>
<p>****: and it starts allover again. And Mary. They are in some latter
state of coital bliss. Horus THRUSTS. Mary GASPS…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Some things… you just never forget.</p>
