<p><strong>confessions of a dangerous mind</strong>: a screenplay by</p>
<p><strong>performer</strong>: Why’d they do that? I wasn’t done.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t understand. Juice, why’d you gong
this nice man?</p>
<p><strong>jaye p. morgan</strong>: Not to be. That is the answer.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: We’ll be right back with more stuff.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Fuck. Shit. Piss.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: More stuff?</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you
requested. Except I couldn’t find a… … DH-10 directional fragmentation
mine.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, it’s late. But thank you. Thank you
for trying. You are a scholar and a…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Keep it. It’s okay. Keep it. You are a
scholar and a…</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Why are you not looking at me like that? Do
I look ugly to you? It’s the not sleeping. I’m not sleeping, see. I have
a lot on my…</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You know what I’d do? – And don’t tell
anybody – I’d rub… I’d rub Alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs
would stick their noses into my… dick. Guaranteed big laugh, right? That
was my trick, my great contribution to the world. How wouldn’t I degrade
myself, I ask you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I ask you!</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: I… I… I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don’t watch
the show every night, you wouldn’t have to –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I always pay for the damn tv’s, don’t I?
Don’t I?!</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: It’s – Yes, you do, sir, and we appreciate
that – It’s just that there’ve been complaints from some of the other
guests, and Mr. Andrews, the assistant manager, requested that I –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Still? Complaints? I specifically used the
silencer this time! Specifically!</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Well, the people in 917 found a bullet
lodged in their wall. And while we want to accommodate you – we
certainly value your patronage – there is an issue of customer
safety.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: My apologies. Buy – 917, is it? – buy them a
magnum of your finest champagne. And… and your finest spackle. Oh, and
get me a bag of plastic army men while you’re out. I forgot to tell you
before.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Thank you for your understanding, sir.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: And some black socks! Seven black socks, you
rascule!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by the
sight of me. And why not? I’m wrinkled… … like a prune. Covered in liver
spots… … like an old guy. My hair is falling out in clumps, leaving
exposed patches of white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube of fat hangs
from my waist, practically obscuring my bedraggled prick – dark and
shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine even though I left the toilet
ages ago. My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound. George Orwell said
every man has the face he deserves by fifty. Does every man have the
asshole he deserves by fifty, as well? Does every fifty year old asshole
have the asshole he deserves?</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: It was 1981. I had holed myself up in
this New York hotel. Parker Hotel. Terrified of everything. Ashamed of
my life.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Ashamed? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: When you’re young, your potential is
infinite. You might do anything, really. You might be great. You might
be Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you get to an age where what you
might be gives way to what you have been. You weren’t Einstein. You
weren’t anything. That’s a bad moment. But I remembered something
Carlyle wrote: “… there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is
a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed.” I realized my salvation
might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly. Maybe it would
serve as a cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me understand why.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I have
written pop songs, I have been a television producer. I am responsible
for polluting the airwaves with mind- numbing, puerile entertainment. In
addition, I have murdered thirty-three human beings. I am damned to
hell.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1931,
my early childhood remains accessible to me only as a series of
elliptical, enigmatic memories.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The taste of bologna fresh from the
butcher.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The sickly sweet smell of a burning babydoll
on a crisp autumn day.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Velvet brushing against my tender young
skin, as my mother dressed me.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: A constant, inarticulate rage leading to
fist fight after fist fight.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The calm I felt watching dust suspended in
the early morning sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I remember fear.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Love.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I bet you would like to be a mommy some day,
wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes, mommy. Please.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: C’mere, you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Rejection.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Expulsion.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: When I was sixteen I had an experience with
my little sister’s friend Tuvia that left an indelible impression.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Phoebe’s no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I don’t know who that is.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Of course you don’t. Why are you waiting
around anyway, listening to this cacophonous cacophony, when you could
be in your own abode disrupting the lives of your own siblings?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I don’t know what anything you say means.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: No. You wouldn’t, would you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey, Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Wha-at?!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You wanna lick it?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No. Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, for one thing it tastes like
strawberry. My sister tells me you love strawberries.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Yeah, well… I hate strawberries.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Honestly, a man’s penis tastes exactly like
a strawberry lollipop.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Look, I know that’s not true, so –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It is true. It’s weird but it’s true. I just
read a research paper on it.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: My first love.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Uchh. Yech. It doesn’t taste anything like
strawberry, you creep.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, what does it taste like?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Y’know, I’m gonna tell your mother what you
just did.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: If you do, I’ll tell your mother you made
our dog lick your crack.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I did not!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Perhaps my whole life turned at that point.
The repulsiveness of my sex confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening
pubescent girl.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: And so I found myself in a downward spiral
of debauchery. Endlessly chasing pussy. My only focus in life: to get
laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself into believing that given the
right combination of circumstances and deception, maybe the Tuvias of
the world could desire me the way I desired them. I only wanted to be
loved.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: A constant, inarticulate rage led to bar
fight after bar fight.</p>
<p><strong>subtitle</strong>: New Jersey Turnpike, 1955</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: As much as I tried, I couldn’t understand my
past and my present was miserable, so, at twenty-four, I decided what I
needed was a future…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: … I had heard that television was an
industry with a future.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Next, we’ll have a look at the studio where
they produce the Today Show.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda
cute, huh?</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Cute’s all well and good, Mary Ann, but
what you want is a man who’s goin’ places. A go-getter on the management
fast-track.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Management trainee application, please.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: How many people applying for this so
far?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Let’s see, including you… about two
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: For how many positions?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Tell me again.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Head of network sales at thirty. Head of the
entire network at forty.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all my
millions left to you.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: You’re wonderful. I love you, Mr. Chuck
Barris, management trainee.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Life was sweet. For a minute.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Baby doll!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I got fired.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Fired?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Fired. F-I-R…</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Fired? What the fuck did you get fired
for?!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t know, efficiency cutback. Some
bullshit… Look, it’s gonna be…</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Well, I’m pregnant, you fuck!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Yeah, pregnant!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What the fuck did you get pregnant for?!</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: What do you mean, what the fuck did I get
pregnant for? You got me fucking pregnant, you fuck!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: So I figured I’d skip town. I intend to be
important, y’know, I can’t be saddled with this.. But then I remembered
something Carlyle said: “Do the duty which lies nearest thee.”</p>
<p><strong>bar fly</strong>: Who’s Carlyle?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Dear God, why do I even bother?</p>
<p><strong>bar fly</strong>: Hey, fuck you, you condescending prick.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey, fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>bar fly</strong>: Hey, fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey, fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Looks like I was just late.</p>
<p><strong>actual georgia</strong>: I woke up and he was gone. No note.
No nothing. I never saw him again. Until that stupid tv show he did.</p>
<p><strong>jewish-looking man</strong>: The Gong Show.</p>
<p><strong>actual georgia</strong>: I know what it’s called, jerk.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: In ’61 I was thirty. I had become a minor
suit at ABC. It was during the music payola scandal…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: …so my job was to commute to Philly every
day to the American Bandstand tapings, and keep an eye on Dick
Clark.</p>
<p><strong>dick clark</strong>: Chuck Barris? He spooked me. I tried to
keep on his good side becuase he was sort of… spooky.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>dick clark</strong>: I dunno, there was something in his
eyes. Something dark, like unbridled ambition, maybe. Or an inarticulate
rage.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: On weekends I used to hang around amusement
parks. Because that’s where the young girls were.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I wrote a song about my experience.</p>
<p><strong>freddie cannon</strong>: Last night I took a walk after
dark/to see a place called Palisades Park/to have some fun and see what
I could see/that’s where the girls are</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I got it to Freddie “Boom Boom” Cannon
through my friendship with Dick Clark. Dick really wanted to help me
out.</p>
<p><strong>freddie cannon</strong>: I took a ride on the shoop de
shoop/that girl I sat beside was awful cute/and when we stopped she was
holding hands with me/my heart was flying/up like a rocket ship/down
like a roller coaster/fast like a loop de loop/round like a merry go
’round…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I wrote this song.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh. Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s number three on the pop charts.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: See, I believe there’s a great future in
television.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: So I’m going to take my royalties and create
a pilot. A pilot is what they call a test tv show.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I work in tv.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah. It’s gonna be a game show. I believe
there’s a great future in game shows.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Everyone loves game shows, right?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, they do.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: That’s great then.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m on my way!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi. Don’t be alarmed I’m with Debbie.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Yeah, I figured.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Um, no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: If you have a beer.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: So how was sex with Debbie? I’ve always
wondered.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: No problem. I just got fucked by this drummer
cat. A really righteous Negro hipster.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Huh. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: See, I believe in the brotherhood of man.
Last week I got fucked by an Oriental. What are you?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jew.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s what I thought. I had a Jew, but he
was Sephardic. You look Ashkenazi , I’m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Ashkenazi.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Right. Ashkenazi… I haven’t balled one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You’re a romantic.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Eh, I just don’t get into all the bullshit
between cats and chicks.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Besides, you fall in love with a cat, you
only get hurt. Right?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Don’t I know it.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: We could ball if you want. I seem to like you
pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, that would be good. But, you know, I’m
kind of here with Debbie. It doesn’t seem right.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Yeah. That’s true. I didn’t think of that.
Well, I’m going to bed. Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Penny.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Oh, you’re the one who wrote that Palisades
song. I love that song. It’s such sentimental bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: … so this ape and I were looking at each
other. It was, like, across time and evolution. Then he began to talk,
but it was a language I didn’t understand, maybe Swiss. Then he turned
into Perry Como, real square and… what’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Just because we fucked, doesn’t mean there
are strings now. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Okay? I only wanted to tell you my dream is
all. Nothing more complicated than that. Don’t panic.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m just used to all this dating bullshit,
y’know. Now we’re a couple. Now I’m obliged to give a shit what you
say.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Don’t worry about it, I’m not into those
games either. So, anyway, this monkey turns into Perry Como and I say
–</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Holy fuck!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Holy holy fuck! You just gave me an idea.
For a show! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: A show about monkeys?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: In a way. About the craziest monkey of all:
Monkius Humanius! Don’t you see? About people! About sex. About romance.
About the bullshit of dating!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I call it The Dating Game, Mr. Goldberg. And
that’s what it’s about. A pretty girl asks three handsome guys, who she
can’t see, silly questions. And based on their answers, she picks one to
date. And we pay for the date. That’s it! That’s the show! It’s got
everything!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: They bought it!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: They bought it they bought it they bought
it…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: They’re giving me seventy-five hundred
fucking dollars to make a pilot!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Oh my God! Oh my God! We gotta go celebrate!
Let’s go roller skating!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I can’t, Pen. I got a date.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Okay. That’s cool. Call me after.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeha, okay. I will.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: I figured I was in. All I had to do
was get the pilot made and I’d be a millionaire. Everyone would love
me.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: Was anyone ever so young?</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Chuck…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Albert’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Well, he led an amazingly long life.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Still, it’s hard to go on.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Y’know, you’ve been staring out this window
for six months now.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m trying to come up with new tv shows, if
you must know. Okay? That’s what I’m doing. I believe there’s a real
future in tv. Look. Ideas. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: You’re thirty-two years old, and you have no
career and no prospects.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Thanks for the status report, Phoebe. Look,
I just gotta come up with the right concept. Then, boom. Which, by the
way, I’ve almost got.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: You’re breaking mom’s heart. You know that,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Somehow, and don’t ask me why, Phoebe, my
being born broke mom’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey Phoebe, you ever see what’s-her-name,
Tuvia, anymore?</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Tuvia. Your friend. Tuvia. The girl.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Oh. No. I heard something. I think she got
divorced recently or something.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>older tuvia</strong>: Yes? Well, if it isn’t Strawberry-dick
Barris.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi, Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>older tuvia</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I came by to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>older tuvia</strong>: Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>older tuvia</strong>: Well, if it isn’t Strawberry-dick
Barris. Now what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: So I’m back in town. For a while. I thought
maybe you and I could –</p>
<p><strong>older tuvia</strong>: Jesus, you’ve got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: You’re a pretty angry young fella, aren’t you?
Can’t fight worth a damn though.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Screw off, fag. Don’t think I haven’t seen
you watching me in that bar for a week now.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Kind of a loner, I’d say. Fairly bright. A tad
anti-social. Mad at the world. Can I buy you lunch?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Look, there’s a schoolyard half a block
down. Why don’t you go trolling there?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: I could teach you at least thirty different
ways to kill a man with a single blow, Mr. Barris.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Might help you in future bar fights. Just a
thought.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Oh, and there’s money in it. Good money.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: … and I figure if I can keep afloat until I
come up with my next game show idea, then all will be copacetic.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: That sounds great, Chuck. Y’know, I’ve never
known a television producer before. I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, yeah. So what’s this money deal you
were talking about?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Well, I work for a government agency, and I
can always use good, enthusiastic men to help me carry out my
directives.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What kind of work? What government
agency?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Problem solving work. For the Office of
Diplomatic Security.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Office of what? Never heard of it. Is that
the fucking CIA or something?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Please be discreet, Mr. Barris.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jesus, it is the fucking CIA! Hell, I’ll be
a spy! Where do I sign up? Are you fucking with me? You’re fucking with
me, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Hardly. And you wouldn’t be with the company.
You’d be a contract agent. Independent. No official tie to any agency.
Is that understood?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: As you know, I’ve been watching you. For
years, actually. I’ve only let you know about it for the last week.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: I’m happy to report you fit our profile,
Mr. Barris. Are you interested in this work?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, what’s the profile?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Are you interested in this work,
Mr. Barris?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, sure, I wanna be a secret agent.
Contract agent. Whatever. Get to fuck beautiful Eastern European women.
Wear a trenchcoat. Sounds like a kick.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: The work we do is very serious. It’s essential
in quelling the rise of communism and allowing democracy to gain its
rightful foothold around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sure. Yeah. Okay. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>instructor #1</strong>: There are several efficient methods
of killing a man, were you to find yourself without a weapon. The edge
of your hand against the adversary’s Adam’s apple. This will crush the
windpipe causing strangulation and death.</p>
<p><strong>instructor #1</strong>: Boxing your adversary’s ears with
proper force will cause his ear drums to burst and possibly result in
bleeding in the brain. And death.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You’re training me to be a killer.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly bright.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I can’t kill people. My future is in
television.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Listen, you’re thirty-two years old and you’ve
achieved nothing. Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by thirty-three.
Better get cracking.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I have ideas for shows.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Oh, good. Why don’t you spend another six
months developing ’em while staring out the window at mommy’s house next
to poor dead Albert the dog.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: How do you know all that?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: I know everything about you, Chuck. For fuck’s
sake, I know which hand you jerk off with.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Right. Leave in the morning, if you want. But
I’m here to tell you this is honest work for good pay. You’d be helping
to make the world safer. And your country would be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: It’ll toughen you up.</p>
<p><strong>instructor #1</strong>: Glycerin is, of course, the
best-known nitrating agent. Now keep in mind, nitroglycerin is extremely
unstable. A slight tap, a one degree change in temperature and it’ll
blow up in your hands. Yee-haa, let’s mix us up a batch!</p>
<p><strong>instructor #1</strong>: Everybody take your 75 ml beaker and
fill it to the 13 ml level with fuming red nitric acid, 98%
concentration.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Salvador Panagra Renda, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>benitez</strong>: Si. In the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: What have you got for me, Manny?</p>
<p><strong>benitez</strong>: Renda leaves his apartment every day at
8:30, alone, walks east two blocks to this news kiosk, buys a paper and
heads south four blocks to the plaza of the Museum Nacional to read
it.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Okay. Chuck, you’re here at 8:25. Dress like a
tourist. Start walking north. You should pass Renda here. Stop him and
ask him in bad Spanish where the museum is. Make sure he doesn’t
understand what you’re asking.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: You’ll be parked here. Brazioni, you’re behind
the wheel. Benitez, you’re on the street leaning into the car chatting
with Benitez. When Chuck stops Renda, you turn to help with the
directions, stick a gun into Renda’s ribs, and direct him into the back
seat. Chuck, you get in first. Renda’s between you and Benitez.
Brazioni, whaddaya got?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Nice. You got suppresers with those, I’m
assuming.</p>
<p><strong>brazioni</strong>: I am not an imbecile.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Glad to hear it. Wasn’t sure.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Where are you going to be, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Poolside, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Hola, Chuckito. Que pasa?</p>
<p><strong>young barris</strong>: So what’d this guy Renda do
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: It’s your job to follow directives, not
question their validity.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: He’s a bad guy, Chuck. He’s one of the bad
guys. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Bad for the U.S., right, Jim? Not bad in an
absolute sense, just bad for the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Don’t fuckin’ dance with me, Barris. Renda’s
bad for the Tea and Biscuit Co. He’s bad for me personally. You work for
me, and Renda’s bad for me. You’re now officially a patriotic citizen of
the United States of Jim Byrd.</p>
<p><strong>young barris</strong>: Look, this is –</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: There’s no backing out now, Chuck. We’ve let
you in on everything. So you don’t play, you don’t leave Mexico.
Comprende?</p>
<p><strong>young barris</strong>: I was just –</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: I like you. I really do. And you’re gonna do
fine tomorrow. And we’re gonna become great friends. And you’re gonna
have a very nice little career. But you’ve got to grow up. There’s a war
on.</p>
<p><strong>young barris</strong>: What war?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: That’s not your concern.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Excusa me, por favor, Senor.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros?</p>
<p><strong>renda</strong>: No comprende.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares?</p>
<p><strong>benitez</strong>: May I be of some assistance here?</p>
<p><strong>brazioni</strong>: Day of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>renda</strong>: Por favor. No me mates, senor. Tengo tres
bebes.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>renda</strong>: Que?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Repitolo.</p>
<p><strong>renda</strong>: No me mates. Tengo tres bebes.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh Christ. Oh crap.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Beautiful country, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>young barris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: You did us proud, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Renda was a bad guy. He really was.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I had changed. I could see it in my eyes.
Something dark.</p>
<p><strong>renda</strong>: No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: “Don’t kill me. I am three babies.” I am
three babies? What the fuck does that mean? Oh. “I have three babies.”
Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Chuck, is that you throwing up?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jesus Christ, Penny. You scared the shit out
of me. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Sorry. I just been crashing here for a few
days. Waiting for you. Where you been, man, where you been?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Mexico. Just on a little vaca…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You drank the water, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You’re not supposed to. Montessori’s Revenge.
You’re not even allowed to open your mouth or your eyes when you take a
shower. It’s crazy. How come our water is so good and their water is
poison? It’s the same ocean.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: It’s weird, huh? So I’m a hippy now.
Look.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I’ve been in San Francisco, and it’s amazing.
Everybody loves everybody and there’s lots of colors. We’re gonna change
the world, Chuck. Come back with me and be my old man, okay? Not that
old! Ha ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Penny, I’m a little tired now, so…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Oh! You gotta hear this song!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: “Cause I made my mind up, you’re going to be
mine…”</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Penny, what did you do to my wall?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Oh, it’s a guy who called a couple a days
ago. Gold-Bird. Isn’t it pretty?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Leonard Goldberg?! You’re kidding? Hello,
this is Chuck Barris returning for Leonard Goldberg.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Hi, Chuck!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Mr. Goldberg! I’m so sorry I didn’t get back
to you right away. I was out of town. Vacationing in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Good for you. Listen, Chuck. We’ve ended
up with a damn hole in our daytime schedule. I’ve been reviewing some
options, and it occurred to me there might be a place here for you and
your baby.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: My baby, Mr. Goldberg?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: The Dating Game. That is your baby, isn’t
it, Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes sir, it is.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Are you still interested?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes sir. Very interested. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Good man. We’ll need to start airing in
about six weeks. Is that do-able for you and your people?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: My people? Six weeks? Sure. Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Great. Keep me posted.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Damn Mexicans and their water.</p>
<p><strong>blonde bachelorette</strong>: Bachelor number two, what would
I like most about you?</p>
<p><strong>beanpole bachelor</strong>: I am very romantic and I would
send you flowers every day.</p>
<p><strong>blonde bachelorette</strong>: Aww. That’s sweet. Bachelor
number three, what would I like most about you?</p>
<p><strong>frizzy-haired bachelor</strong>: My big cock.</p>
<p><strong>brunette bachelorette</strong>: Bachelor number one, what
nationality are you?</p>
<p><strong>handsome bachelor</strong>: Well, my father is Welsh and my
mother is Hungarian, so I guess that makes me Well- Hung.</p>
<p><strong>black bachelorette</strong>: Bachelor number three, I play
the trombone. If I blew you, what would you sound like?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are
unairable.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Look, Len, the show’s spontaneous, it’s
unscripted. That’s it’s charm. I can’t control what people say.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can’t
have black men getting blow jobs on national television!</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: The point isn’t that he’s black, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Well, I know that. That’s not what I
meant.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these
shows. Right? And that’s good. Show business must avoid indifference at
all costs.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Even when taste is involved?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Taste is just a word.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: You don’t fuck with taste, my friend!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What does that even mean? I don’t even under
–</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Chuck, we cannot air this stuff. That’s
it. If you can’t figure out how to retain your spontaneity without the
contestants being lewd, we’re going to have to pull the show.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi, folks. Before we begin taping today, I’d
like to introduce you to Mr. Peter Jenks of the Federal Communications
Commission.</p>
<p><strong>instructor #1</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don’t know
if any of you are aware of this, but it’s a federal offense to make
licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast. The penalty for
this disgusting, un-American behavior is one year in prison or a ten
thousand dollar fine or both. Anyone making a sick, subversive remark
tonight will be arrested immediately. I will then personally escort the
offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the
Broadcast Act of 1963. And it’s a long drive to that prison. Just you
and me. No other witnesses –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Okay. Have fun, everybody!’</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: Sometimes as a younger man I
stretched the truth to get what I wanted. “Through all the lying days of
my youth/I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I may whither
into the truth.” Yeats. You heard of him?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Yeah. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: Sure you have. Anyway, my little lie
worked. We aired and become a big hit. A phenomenon, really.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I’ll get back to you on
Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Jesus, Barris, take a Darvon.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey, baby.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I know. Sit. Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m busy. We’re in the middle of a
bachelorette crisis out there.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I just got a call from the network.
Drink?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You got any weed?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I wish.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Then I’ll have a drink. Bad news?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The Tammy Grimes Show is being pulled from
Saturday night.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh my God! So?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: They want to put a prime-time version of the
Dating Game on in its place.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Shit! You’re kidding! That’s fucking
great!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: But they say the day-time version’s not hot
enough. They want me to make it more exciting for night-time. I got
forty- eight hours.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What do you have so far?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Nothing. Bupkis. I mean, the show is what it
is. I don’t have a clue. This could be my big break, Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yeah, I know. Don’t blow it.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Thank you for your help.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hey, I brought the ice.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Boy, didn’t I teach you anything?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: You’re so rusty, it’s embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You’re a stupid fucking turd, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Can I buy you lunch?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Ah, lighten up, hombre.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: My fucking neck hurts. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Poor baby. Look, I’ve been put in charge of a
fairly large wet operation and I could use your help.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Have you noticed, Jim, I’ve got a tv show on
the air? I don’t need to kill people for hire anymore.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: I know you don’t need to. But you’d like
to.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: That’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Think of it as a hobby. An avocation.
Something you do to relax. You can be an assassination enthusiast, a
murder bug.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’ve got important things to think about
here. I don’t have time to fuck around with you.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Okay, I’ll help you out with your little show.
Tit for tat. That’s the kinda guy I am. I’ve seen this Dating Game of
yours, Chuck. And I have a thought.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What, now you’re a television producer?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Hey, I’m CIA operative John Q. Public when it
comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Let’s hear it then.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Well, what do you have now? The couple gets
sent to some stupid second-rate Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right?
Sets you back fifty bucks? That’s not too exciting a prize to us
vicarious- living boobs out in TV-land.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, what’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send ’em to some
exotic locale. Europe, Southeast Asia, for example.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The network’s not going to let me send two
unmarried kids on vacation together.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Send ’em with a chaperone. Some respectable
old lady with a sewn closed snatch.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Y’know, that’s not half bad.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: I’m telling ya. And… And sometimes you can be
the chaperone, Chuckie. Let’s say we have a job for you in Austria. You,
a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple,
and while you’re there, blam! you take care of some Company business.
It’s the perfect cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative by night.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I told you, I don’t have to kill people for
money anymore.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Chuck, when I said you fit our profile, very
little of that had to do with you needing the money. Some of it, but
very little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck. I saw it in your eyes. You
liked it but you botched it. Don’t you want to get really good at
something, Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Ready one, take one. Ready three, take
three. Ready one, take one.</p>
<p><strong>blonde bachelorette</strong>: Number one, can you please tell
me what a girl is like who hasn’t been on a date before and how you can
tell she hasn’t been on a date before?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Ready two, take two. This guy has never
been on a date.</p>
<p><strong>fat bachelor</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jesus, she’s gotta pick this guy. This is
just too good.</p>
<p><strong>fat bachelor</strong>: … I’ll ask her what she likes to do
and –</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Ready one, take one. Ready two, take
two.</p>
<p><strong>fat bachelor</strong>: And if she doesn’t know what she likes
to do –</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Ready three, take three. The only date
he’s ever had is with his right hand.</p>
<p><strong>fat bachelor</strong>: … then I’ll know she hasn’t done it
yet.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Excuse me, is this seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: By you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: London is wonderful this time of year, isn’t
it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Excuse me, is this seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: By you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: London is wonderful this time of year, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Especially the fog. It affords one
solitude, even in a city full of people.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Yes, I gathered.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Here you go, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: At least give me a made-up name. Something
for me to cry out during those dark nights of the soul.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Cry out, “Olivia!”</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: That’s Twelfth Night.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Very good, Chuck. I’m pleasantly
surprised. You’re not like the other murderers.</p>
<p><strong>fat bachelor</strong>: I thinks he’s really pretty and I want
to be her boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: Do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sorry. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Don’t worry, we’re not gonna cheat you.</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: Just the same.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Thank you. Oh, one more thing.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sorry about your teeth.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s Ronnie, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: C’mere, Ronnie. I want to show you something
neat. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I
did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor. He was ugly and fat and stupid.
More life wouldn’t have changed that for him. No woman would ever have
loved him. That’s just the brutal truth, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Olivia?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: It’s Patricia, actually.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: … and so then I spent a year in Operation
Chaos, inside the anti-war movement as an agent provocateur, nudging it
toward violence in order to discred it. That was fun. I got to wear
granny glasses.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why’d you
come up here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: I don’t know. You’re sort of cute in a
homely way. And it’s always lonely when that civilian you’re fucking
calls out the name off your fake passport.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: “All the information I have about myself is
from forged documents.”</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Nabokov.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Actually, I just gotta go into the bathroom
and take care of something.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: No, baby. Leave the microfilm in.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Hey, buddy. This is Simon Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Everything go okay? You don’t look too
good.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one
of my missions by killing a game show contestant. Is that
understood?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You’re welcome, pal.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Fuck you! They’re my contestants.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Amateur.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Faggot.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Chuck –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in
possession of my microfilm?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Let’s have it then.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s up my ass, Oliver. Why don’t you reach
on up there and get it.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I just feel I deserve some appreciation for
my efforts.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: What do you think Patricia Watson was?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Prick.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Well, if isn’t the hitman.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>office workers</strong>: Hitman! Hitman! Hitman! Hitman!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I said, well, if it isn’t the hitman. Just
heard through the grapevine that ABC is going to pick up The Newlywed
Game.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You’re kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Not kidding you. Day-time and prime-
time.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh, fuck, Loretta. That’s sensational!</p>
<p><strong>office workers</strong>: Hitman! Hitman! Hitman!</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: The Newlywed Game was based on my
theory that almost any American would sell out their spouse for a
washer-drier or a lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my respect for
that most holy of unions. I must’ve been on to something, because the
show aired for thirteen years.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Great wheels, man.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, I decided to start treating myself
right. You spend so much time denying yourself things. Life’s too
short.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Yeah, I really gork what you’re saying,
man.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You really grok what I’m saying, man. Not
gork.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Oh. Really?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Outa sight! Buy this one.</p>
<p><strong>real estate agent</strong>: Hi. Welcome, folks. If you
wouldn’t mind signing-in on our sheet over th –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>real estate agent</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’ll take the house.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p><strong>real estate agent</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: So, man, are you seeing anyone?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Nobody serious. You?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: No. I think we should get married.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Aw, Pen, don’t start –</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: No, listen, it makes sense. You and I feel
exactly the same about marriage, right? How much bullshit it is, right?
And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it
are small. So, it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I liked Penny. I even loved her in my way.
But the idea of tying myself down for the rest of my life… I remember my
parents’ marriage.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We need a new ice box.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer
with automatic ice maker!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Beautiful. Did you see that? How much they
loved each other just then? That’s what it’s all about, kiddies.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Okay, guys, new business. We’re winning our
slots every week.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: But that means we need you Bandits to get on
the contestant mill. Our supply of dumbfucks is lagging behind our
demand for dumbfucks. And I’m gonna be introducing three new shows in
the coming months: The Parent Game, The Game Game, and the Dollar
Ninety-Eight Beauty Pageant, so we’re gonna really need you guys to
carry your weight. Nuff said. Any other business?</p>
<p><strong>employee #1</strong>: Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at
lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got two.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oooh. Is that true, Rick? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Here. No, it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Any other witnesses to this alleged
infraction?</p>
<p><strong>employee #2</strong>: I saw it. He took four. I only got
one.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Rick, you’re dead meat, buddy. I sentence
you to… dance for us in today’s post-meeting version of “Out of Limits”
featuring the musical stylings of the CBP Stompers.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Aw, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Get up here, you rascule, you.</p>
<p><strong>jim lange</strong>: Sometimes Chuck would just disappear for
weeks. I remember once we had a conflict on the set over the right way
to throw that kiss at the end of the show, y’know… … and Chuck was just
not reachable to resolve it.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: What was the conflict?</p>
<p><strong>jim lange</strong>: Look, it’s water under the bridge. I’m
not gonna talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The word’s interpret.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Interpet.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Interpret.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Well, do you have an extra “r” then I could
borrow?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m not going to give you a letter. You’re
lucky I don’t make you forfeit a turn.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Oh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’ll run to the store and get some more.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Don’t cheat.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You neither.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Intrepet’s a word, right?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Intrepid.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Shit fuck piss. Okay okay okay…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Pen, we should call it a night. I’m kinda
tired.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You’re tired.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I got a date.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I just met this girl.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Like, just now ?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah. Kinda.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Well, that’s rude.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Yeah, well, see ya…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Wow, this is a beautiful place you got!</p>
<p><strong>roommate</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Chuck, this is Mindy, one of my
roommates.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: So… have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
as your savior, Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: Yeah, I remember that religious girl,
sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh God, she had the softest, fleeciest
clam I ever experienced. It took a little more work than usual, but I
got in there, baby. It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get old, y’know, but
the taste for soft clam, it just doesn’t go away. This is the great
tragedy of getting old.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Getting married to Alan is the best thing
I’ve ever done. It’s just so wonderful knowing that you’ve got someone
by your side through everything for he rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: ’kay, Mon. He’s off.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: My sweet little clamato.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I can’t be pregnant, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Is it mine?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I can’t believe you asked me that.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I know. I’m sorry. But you’re sure,
right?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I hate you so much right now.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Look, we’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: How? Are you gonna marry me?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, no. Not at this point.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m not murdering my baby! I can’t… do that.
Please…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Beautiful country, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s okay. It’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: What a waste.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Tell me about it. I figure over the years I
must’ve spent close to twenty grand on these abortions: airfare, hotels,
doctors, gifts.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s not what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: And I don’t even know how many of these
fetuses were mine. That’s what really kills me.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: It was his.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Yeah. It was his.</p>
<p><strong>woman #3</strong>: It wasn’t his. I lied.</p>
<p><strong>woman #4</strong>: Yes, it was his baby.</p>
<p><strong>woman #5</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>woman #6</strong>: The godamn son of a bitch. He asked you to
ask me this?</p>
<p><strong>woman #7</strong>: I was screwing a lot of guys at the time.
It coulda been his.</p>
<p><strong>woman #8</strong>: Uh-uh. I just needed someone to pay for
it. He was a wallet with legs.</p>
<p><strong>woman #9</strong>: Yeah, I was just a kid. It ruined my
life.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: I don’t really want to talk about
this.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: So I’m assuming this means Monica is out of
the picture.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, I got baptized for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Chuck, I was thinking… I have this plan now,
now that you’re free –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: God, you look cute today.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I always look cute. Don’t distract me. What
was I going to say?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You do know. Chuck, why don’t we get married?
We’ve known each other forever. We’ve fucked each other forever. You
think I’m cute, you just said. You always come to me when you’re in
trouble. And you’re almost forty, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I know how old I almost am! That’s it. Don’t
ever ask me to marry you again!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m sorry I yelled at you today, Pen.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I’m not crying because you yelled at me. This
is it, isn’t it? This is us.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: I almost asked Penny to marry me
right then. But I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Uh.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Rod Flexner’s here.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Shit piss fuck, send him in.</p>
<p><strong>flexner</strong>: Chuck! Great to see you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What’s up, Rod?</p>
<p><strong>flexner</strong>: Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your
shows aren’t doing too well in the old ratings war. The Family Game, for
one.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>flexner</strong>: And How’s Your Mother-in-Law is, quite
frankly, in the toilet, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>flexner</strong>: Now, as you know, Dream Girl is flailing
terribly.</p>
<p><strong>flexner</strong>: And The Game Game has no life in it at
all.</p>
<p><strong>flexner</strong>: So I’ve been put in the unfortunate
position of having to inform you that the network is canceling all four
of these shows. Now don’t shoot me, Chuck, I’m just the messenger.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: They killed my babies. Just like that. I
pushed them into the world through the birth canal of my imagination.
Lovingly. Tenderly. Where’s the humanity of these people?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: The fucking bastards.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What am I gonna do now? Hey there, can I buy
you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: What are you blind, asshole? This lady’s
with me.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Let’s see, if I remember correctly, the next
move breaks your neck, which kills you instantly or paralyzes you.
Depending on your luck.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece of
shit dog-shit shithead.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi. I’m Chuck Barris, tv producer. Have you
ever done any acting?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Hey, I was just in the –</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: What is she doing here, man?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: She’s –</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: This is our house, man. Our house! It’s one
thing to go elsewhere for your pussy needs. But this is our house!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: This is not our house, it’s my house.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: It’s our house! I found it with you. I
decorated it for you! I spent six months sitting on that fucking couch
she’s fucking you on, fucking waiting for the fucking plumbers to come!
God, you are such an asshole!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I should go. This doesn’t feel right.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Wanna see a stupid girl vomit?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Why were you with that girl in our living
room?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s not our living room, Pen.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s your defense? You know what it feels
like to see you with someone else? In any living room.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You know who I am, Penny. I don’t force you
to hang around.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You don’t force me? Fuck. So you’re saying
you have no interest in this, one way or the other?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: No, I’m not saying that.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Well, then, what are you saying, Chuck? Do
you want me around or not? Do you even like me?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Of course I like you.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I need to know how much you like me.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t even know what that means, “how
much?” How can I rate a person in that way? That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You could if you felt it. If you felt it, it
would be easy to rate me. You could spread your arms as wide as they
would go and say, “This much, Penny.”</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Everything’s complicated, Pen. Nothing’s
black and white like that.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Do you want me around or not? If you don’t,
just say so, so I know. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I love you, Pen, in my way. Maybe not in
that crazy, head-over-heels thing, but what is that, anyway? Romantic
love. Isn’t that just an illusion?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: But you just said you love me, right?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Over here, Strawberry-dick.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jesus, how do you know these things?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: We even know what she actually thought it
tasted like.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Really? I could never find that out. What
did she think?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: It’s a “need to know”, my friend. So tell me,
what can I do you for?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I could really use an assignment, Jim. To
straighten my head.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: I got something for your head.</p>
<p><strong>jim lange</strong>: … and we’re the sending the two of you
for three days and three nights to beautiful… West Berlin!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Treesh.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Leibchen. So, here’s what we got. Name’s
Hans Colbert. Other side of the wall. We don’t like him very much.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You’ll work with a kraut named Keeler.
He’s been trailing Colbert for a month now. Knows the routine. Keeler’s
a drunk, so you stay sober and take charge.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Done and done. See you after?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Prove how much you love me, baby. Kill for
me. Then I’m all yours.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What you writing, Sig?</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: I am keeping track of all the goings on on
this street.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: Yah. I know how to do my job.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: Under the seat, please.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: Please, if you don’t mind, a photograph. To
remember.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Housekeeping, Mr. Barris.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Another rough night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The human psyche is a wondrous thing.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Yes, I know it is. We don’t need this
now, do we? Why don’t we just put this away?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Mrs. Reynolds, may I rest my head on your
bosom for a little while?</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Oh, that doesn’t really seem like a
very good idea, Mr. Barris.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m sorry. You’re right. I just… I’m just
without… comfort of any sort, and I… please forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: No harm done.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You are a
scholar and…</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: It’s fine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Mrs. Reynolds, what do you suppose God
thinks of someone like me?</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: God?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes, God.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Well, Mr. Barris, your television shows
have brought laughter and joy to millions of people. That’s a very
important thing, I think, in these difficult times. I would imagine God
likes you very much.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Thank you, that’s very kind. So… I should
get back to…</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Yes, of course, sir. Don’t mind me.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m really, really fucked.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What? Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No time. Get in or die.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Merde. KGB. They know who you are, Monsieur
Barris. It is their intention to kill you very much in East Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Merde! MERDE!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Not to worry, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I am Paul Picard, by the way. Nice to meet
you. Do not worry, I am not KGB. I do not want to kill you, I want you
to live a long happy life and have many dancing grandchildren to
admire.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Your ride, Monsieur Barris.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: No fucking way.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It’s quite reliable and easy to operate. It
will get you over the wall. Or you can stay here. In the German
Democratic Republic. I will arrange for you to get a good factory job.
No, you must fly, like Daedalus before you, to the freedom of the
west.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Christ. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: They do not catch me, monsieur. This is my
talent, to get away always. In guerre. In amour. This is my talent, and
perhaps this is my curse.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: So, did you have a nice flight?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were up
to. You were there to kill Colbert, they were there to kill you. I’m
thinking we got a mole. So much hate in the world, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Am I in danger still?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Jesus, yes. KGB didn’t go out of business
since yesterday, so far as I know. You’re fucked, Chuck. But our main
concern should be: if they know who you are, they know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Fuck off. What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>byrd</strong>: Bow out. Lay low. That’s what I’m gonna do.
You’re lucky you have another career to immerse yourself in.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Thank you. Thanks. That was great.</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: I don’t know, Chuck. It’s looking
bleak.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: There’s gotta be somebody in America with
some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every week.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Bring in the next thing.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Thank you. Thank you. We’ll be in touch.
That was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: We’ve been going about this all wrong.
Rather than killing ourselves trying to find good acts, we just book bad
ones and kill them.</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: Chuck, it’s torture to sit through
even one of these people –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: We kill ’em before they’re through. As soon
as it gets unbearable, we kill ’em. Dead.</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: For God’s sake, what are you
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the act…
to kill ’em. And when you kill something, it stops. This I know to be
true.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Why’d you do that, Jamie? This is someone’s
grandmother. She was really trying.</p>
<p><strong>jamie farr</strong>: This is The Gong Show, not the Van
Cliburn eliminations.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: This is a human being with aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh, fuck me. This guy sucks. He’s bringing
everyone down.</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: None of the hosts are getting it,
Chuck. But we have a thought.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: You host.</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: You get it. And we believe your
awkward, non-professional, mumbling persona is exactly right for the
show.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t want to be on tv.</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: Listen, we can’t sit through
anymore of these test shows. Do it, Chuck, or we advise the network to
pull it.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong
Show! I’m your host, Chuck Barris! Ucchhh.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now, here’s the host and star of our
show, Chuck Barris!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Welcome to The Gong Show. Here’s an esoteric
act if there ever was one. Ephemeral. It’s an ephemeral act.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: One that should get us our Emmy. Do we have
an Emmy? We don’t? Well this should get us one. Anyway, ladies and
gentlemen… Big Nose!</p>
<p><strong>big nose</strong>: Why? Why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, win a few, lose a few. We’ll be back
with more stuff… right after this message.</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: You can’t quit.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I can’t quit? But I get panicky, Louise, in
front of all those people.</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: You lack confidence, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I lack confidence?</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: But we’ll take care of that. We’ll
get you some confidence powder. Leave that to us.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Confidence powder?</p>
<p><strong>executive woman</strong>: Nose candy, Chuck. Blow. Snow.
Flake.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Blow, snow, flake?</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Coke.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh. Coke. Okay. Does that work?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, oh, this act is
amazing, your gonna love this act. I’m telling ya. All the way from
Pacoima… David Pincus!</p>
<p><strong>actual jaye p. morgan</strong>: Chuck was real different on
stage and off. Very tense. He was always looking over his shoulder. Even
when we were fucking. Sort of an enigma.</p>
<p><strong>gene gene</strong>: Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde.
Sometimes nice as you please. Give you the shirt off his back. Other
times he’d rant like a crazy man. I remember once he screamed at me that
I didn’t know anything about dancing. “Nijinsky,” he yelled, “now there
was a dancer!”</p>
<p><strong>black comedian</strong>: Today I had a bad day today…</p>
<p><strong>black comedian</strong>: It was so bad, my wife didn’t even
know how to cook.</p>
<p><strong>black comedian</strong>: That barracuda took an egg, put it
in a pot of water, and burned the water. We had to rush that to the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>black comedian</strong>: My mother-in-law…</p>
<p><strong>jamie farr</strong>: Chuck used to love to discuss
philosophy. I think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this
sort of spastic moron. I remember at the time I was reading
Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in
addition to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff with.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Look, Jamie, you know as well as I that
language does not exist without an outward criteria.</p>
<p><strong>jamie farr</strong>: Certainly. Wittgenstein said as much in
Investigations. But if you read Ryle carefully –</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Chuck…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Can we pick up tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>jamie farr</strong>: Yeah. But consider my thinking on
elementary propositions. I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Will do. Love ya.</p>
<p><strong>jamie farr</strong>: Right back at ya, amigo.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: I’m concerned about you. I think you need
to get back into the life. Our sex was always amazing after you killed.
Truth is you’re not that great after your discussions with Jamie
Farr.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Oh, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jamie, I can’t talk anymore tonight –</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: This is Siegfried Keeler. I need to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Assassins do not fraternize. That Keeler was
calling me could mean it was my turn to get hit.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: I am in town on business, Chuck. And I
desire nothing more than your company for dinner. I consider you one of
my closest friends.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sure. Dinner sounds good. There’s a place
called La Scala. See you there at eight.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Dinner sounds good with whom?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Keeler.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: A very fancy place.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Only the best for my friend.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: The friendships one develops during wartime
are remarkably strong.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: So how is the business of television?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, it’s hit and miss. I’ve got a new show
called “Operation Entertainment” which I believe is going to kill. It’s
sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops thing, but it’s weekly and…</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: Why do you do what you do, Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well, I like to think that I bring joy and
laughter to millions of people. I’m not saying that my shows are as good
as they could be. Yet. But –</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: Why do you kill?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: During the second world war, I had the
pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I found it exhilirating. Afterwards,
I could find nothing else to fill me so much with life. So I became what
I am today. I wanted the exhiliration again… of death.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Are you gentlemen ready to order?</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: I’ll have the shrimp scampi and a green
salad.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: And for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: Um, Just give me a steak. Rare.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
with thy whole might. Work while it is called, for the night cometh
wherein no man can work.”</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: That’s Carlyle!</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s amazing you should quote him. He’s my
hero.</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: I read in a book recently that killing your
first man is like making love to your first woman. Every smell, every
nuance, you remember with a special allure, as if the acts had occured
outside civilization, outside time. And when the allure is gone, you are
condemned.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Condemned?</p>
<p><strong>keeler</strong>: I am condemned to live the rest of my life
outside civilization. You will be too, my good friend.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: The next day I heard Keeler offed
himself.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: You never really know in the world of
espionage if something labeled a suicide actually is a suicide. But he
was dead. That I knew.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: When you called, I wasn’t gonna come.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m glad you did, Pen.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I said to myself, enough. Enough of this jerk
already. Enough.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I could see how you would feel that way.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: But I’ve come upon something interesting
through my delvings into human psychology. It’s called TA, Transactual
Analysis.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Transactional Analysis.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Now see, by correcting me you’re responding
as “Parent” to my “Child.” “Here’s the proper way to say this word,
Penny.” But that’s okay. As long as we both understand that’s what
you’re doing. Y’know, I’m okay, you’re okay. So what’s wrong, Chuck? Are
you okay?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: A guy I knew killed himself last night.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: My God. Everyone you know kills themselves.
Or tries. Who is it this time?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You don’t know him. A stagehand.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Why’d he do it?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: He didn’t like his work anymore.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Is being a stagehand really bad or
something?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, it’s pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You were supposed to meet me at The Palm
two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh fuck, I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: I do not get stood up. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Um, Penny, this is Patricia. How did you
find me?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Are you serious? That’s what I do for a
living.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Who’s Patricia? What does she mean, that’s
what she does for a living?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You’re dead in my book,
Strawberry-dick.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Strawberry dick? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: There is no second chance. Get it? Nice
meeting you, Penny. I’ve heard a lot about you. Oh, by the by, Byrd’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: And… and okay… I’m only gonna give you one
more chance, man. That’s it. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Who sent you?! Who the fuck sent you?!</p>
<p><strong>teenage boy</strong>: Nobody, man. We just waited for you to
leave after the show. We just think the show is cool. We just think
you’re cool.</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: Please don’t kill us.</p>
<p><strong>unknown comic</strong>: Hey, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Take it off.</p>
<p><strong>unknown comic</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The fucking bag. Take it off.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, Chuck Barris!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Here he is, the Prince of Puns, the Wizard
of Whoopee… The Unknown Comic!</p>
<p><strong>unknown comic</strong>: Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby, Chuckie
Baby…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>unknown comic</strong>: What’s the difference between toilet
paper and a shower curtain?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>unknown comic</strong>: Here’s the guy!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>unknown comic</strong>: You’re fucking crazy, man.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Phone call from someone named Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Who?!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Tuvia?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’ll take it! Don’t hang up!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Hello, is this Chuck Barris?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Oh, this is Tuvia Feldman. I don’t know if
you remember me –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I’m in town and I’ve been following your
career and I wondered if you might want to get a drink. For old times
sake.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sweet Tuvia…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Ripe Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, Chuck, I got a talent.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Just take a second.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: It’s Tuvia! Remember? Hi!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Old Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Ah, Tuvia. The fantasy of Tuvia forever cast
out by the reality of Tuvia. Finally, because of my fame and her
desperate straits, her poverty and single parenthood, she was going to
submit to me. Finally I could’ve had her.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I could’ve had what had so long eluded me.
But now she was old and I wasn’t interested.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Tuvia was old, but not me. I was the Game
Show King.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: Paul Picard is dead.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Fly, Daedalus, fly!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: This is the moment we’ve been waiting
for…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: The winner is Miss Tiny Brooks!</p>
<p><strong>ed asner</strong>: And the winner is Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>ed asner</strong>: James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, and Ed.
Weinberger, executive producers.</p>
<p><strong>starlet</strong>: I don’t see why your shows are never
nominated.</p>
<p><strong>james l.brooks</strong>: And I honor you, members of the
academy, for recognizing and supporting high quality television.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: But as I stood there, I realized, I
couldn’t kill Jim Brooks, the man who was responsible for such good
stuff: Mary Tyler Moore, Rhoda, Cindy, Phyllis, episodes of My Friend
Tony. I loved those shows as much as anybody in America.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: I couldn’t kill either of us, so I
let us both live. Jim Brooks and me. The rest is history.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey, congratulations, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>james l.brooks</strong>: Oh, hey! Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Chuck Barris. The Gong Show.</p>
<p><strong>james l.brooks</strong>: Oh, right. Hey, thanks, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Once again you deserve it. Your shows are
the greatest. You bring so much… quality to the medium.</p>
<p><strong>james l.brooks</strong>: Thank you. I appreciate that. I
really do</p>
<p><strong>actual jim brooks</strong>: I don’t really remember ever
meeting Chuck Barris.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: In the men’s room at the Emmys, he
says.</p>
<p><strong>actual jim brooks</strong>: I’m not saying it didn’t happen.
I’m just, y’know… If he remembers it, I’m sure it happened. Really
doesn’t seem like much of an anecdote though.</p>
<p><strong>party man #1</strong>: Hey, you’re Chuck Barris!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>party man #1</strong>: I love your show!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Great. I’m just heading –</p>
<p><strong>party man #1</strong>: I have a talent I think you’d really
appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>party man #1</strong>: Hey, didn’t you ever hear of Le
Petomane? He was a star, buddy! These are totally smell-free!</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: I thought it was you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: I’m glad to meet you because I wanted
to tell you that I’ve seen The Gong Show and I think you are the most
insidious and despicable force in entertainment today.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: How dare you subject the rest of the
world to your loathsome view of humanity.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t think it’s that loathsome.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: What is it then? To mock some poor,
lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives. To
destroy them. So everybody’s not brilliantly talented. They’re still
people. They deserve respect and compassion. I mean, who the hell are
you? What the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the
pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you created The Dating Game. Wow, right
up there with the Sistine Chapel. I guess that’s what gives you the
right to…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Excuse me, I’ve got to –</p>
<p><strong>party man #2</strong>: Chuckie Baby! Chuckie Baby! Chuckie
Baby!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: She was right. What the hell had I done with
my life?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Wait, you’re that guy. You’re dead. This is
screwy.</p>
<p><strong>fat bachelor</strong>: I only want to be loved.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: That’s all I fucking wanted!</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: Mr. Barris?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: No, I’m…</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: My name is Louise Wechsler and
I’m here from Tulsa with my family and…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Please, I’m not feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: Just a moment of your time. I
love your show. And, well, I, sort of, have a talent myself.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You can stop by the office to audition
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: Well, I’m leaving tomorrow and I
was just wondering. See, I dance a little and I was just wondering –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, all right. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: That was it. I just disappeared. The
network had to put The Gong Show into reruns. It was 1981. I holed
myself up in this hotel in New York. Parker Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Who Am I?</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Who cares? Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Fuck. Shit. Piss.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Barris.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: How’d you know where I was?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, don’t be an orangutan.
We always know where you are. We always know what you’re doing. By the
by, I’d think twice before I’d attempt to get that tripe you’re writing
published. And there’s a typo on page –</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Look, what do you want, Oliver? I don’t work
for you anymore. I have things to…</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’d like you to come back for one last
assignment, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: No. Now get… Good-bye</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I think you might be interested when I tell
you it’s the mole who fingered your friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard…
and Seigfried Keeler.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Keeler committed suicide.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Yes, of course he did. He threw himself from
a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an
electrical cord.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I’m not interested, Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: As long as the mole’s alive, you don’t have
a chance in hell of remaining so. Besides, killing is in your blood, old
man. You fit the profile.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: That fucking profile again! What’s the fuck
is it?! What the fuck do you bastards know about me, that I don’t?!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Indeed. Where to begin. First, let go of
me.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Let’s see. Well, you had a twin sister,
stillborn, strangled by your umbilical cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your
mother always wanted a daughter. She blamed you for your sister’s death.
And, so, until your sister Phoebe was born, she raised you as a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oh, and your father the dentist? Not really
your father. Your biological father was a man named Edmund James
Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your mother didn’t know when she had an
affair with him in 1930. If you want to look him up, he was also known
as the Tarrytown Troll, because he had been described by witnesses as
short and ugly. Windsor died in the electrical chair at Ossining in
1939. We believed your self- loathing tendencies coupled with that extra
Y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would
serve us well.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’m trying to think what more I can tell
you. I’m sure there’s more. But you have me at a disadvantage here,
Barris. I don’t have your files in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Just leave me the hell alone!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Your mother always loved the game shows, and
you so wanted to please her. We never expected the game show business to
work out for you. But that it did, turned out to be in our favor. I
guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we
anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Huh? What?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Chuck? It’s Pen.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Oh, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Jesus, how’d you find me? Am I listed in
some guidebook or something?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You sent me your last letter on hotel
stationary.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Oh. Well, it’s great to see you, Pen. You
look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I don’t really. But I appreciate the lie. I
know how you hate lying. Boy, this place is scary looking.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah. The human psyche.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I came to take you back to California with
me. It’s a lonely state without you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t know, Redhead.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I can’t wait forever for you to ask me to
marry you, you know. Well, apparently I can. But I really don’t want to.
Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Pen.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I love you so much. You don’t understand. I
don’t even know why. You’re such a schmuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You don’t know the half of it.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You’re not gonna marry me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I don’t know if I can.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: I can’t believe you finally left your two-
hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me. I’m honored.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Y’know, I got a visit this morning from
Penny. She’s wanted to marry me forever. But she doesn’t know who I am,
what I’ve, what I’m capable of.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: And she can’t ever know. So what does she
really love? A lie. And I started thinking, Treesh, you are the only
woman in the world who truly knows me. I know I’ve screwed you over in
the past, and I’m really sorry. I just want you to know that you’re the
one I want to be with. I love you, Treesh.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I hate myself for how I’ve lived,
Treesh.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Neitzsche said, “Whoever despises oneself
still respects oneself as one who despises.”</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I never thought of that. Jesus, I can’t even
despise myself with any insight.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Insane asylums are filled with people who
think they’re Jesus or Satan. Very few have delusions of being the guy
down the block who works at an insurance company. Wonder what that
means.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Y’know, I wanted to be a writer once. I
wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote.
But I never did. I’m the lesser person, Treesh. I never said anything
meaningful that wasn’t said by somebody else first. I am disposable. I
disposed of people and I am disposable. You look cold.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Chuck, what’s gotten into you? You’re
actually acting like a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Well, it’s late. I should get going.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: I suppose you still won’t tell me where
you’re staying.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: No. But I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Drink?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Sure. Bourbon.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: I’ve been thinking a lot about you lately,
Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You could’ve fooled me.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Well, I’ve mellowed.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Look. Boston’s a beautiful city. We could
start over here. A normal person’s life. Together. Selling
insurance.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: That sounds right.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: To life.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: To life.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: L’Chaim.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: It’s done and I’m done. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Agreed. But if you get antsy… and you
will.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Hey, Redhead?</p>
<p><strong>justice of the peace</strong>: We have come here today to
join together Penny Pacino and Chuck Barris.</p>
<p><strong>justice of the peace</strong>: You all know Chuck Barris: the
creator of The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, The Family Game…</p>
<p><strong>justice of the peace</strong>: … The Game Game, Dream Girl of
1968, Operation Entertainment, How’s Your Mother-in-Law? and many
others. Chuck Barris who most recently brought us such hits as The
Rah-Rah Show, Treasure Hunt, Leave it to the Women, The Dollar-Ninety-
Eight Beauty Show, and The Gong Show. The Chuck Barris, who I’m sure
will be back with even more shows to…</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Drive, Danny! Now!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Pen, I have something to confess.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: You know me as the creator of The Dating
Game, The Newlywed Game, The Family Game, The Game Game, How’s Your
Mother-in-law, Dream Girl of 1968…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Operation Entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Yeah, Operation Entertainment. The Rah- Rah
Show, Gong Show, The Dollar-Ninety- Eight Beauty Show, The Ra-Rah
Show…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: You said that already.</p>
<p><strong>barris</strong>: Okay. Okay, but what you don’t know is that
I’ve brutally murdered thirty-three people for the CIA.</p>
<p><strong>actual barris</strong>: Y’know, I came up with a new game
show idea recently. It’s called The Old Game. You got three old guys
with loaded guns on stage They look back at their lives, see who they
were, what they accomplished, how close they came to realizing their
dreams. The winner is the one who doesn’t blow his brains out. He gets a
refrigerator.</p>
