<h1 id="titanic">titanic</h1>
<p><strong>1 blackness</strong>: Then two faint lights appear, close
together… growing brighter. They resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES,
free-falling toward us like express elevators.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext./ int. mir one / north atlantic deep</strong>: PUSHING
IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to its
circular viewport to see the occupants.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. the bottom of the sea</strong>: A pale, dead-flat
lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIR ONE enters
FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its thrusters. It
hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud BONK.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. mir one</strong>: Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the
landing.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: We are here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. / int. mir one and two</strong>: 5 MINUTES LATER: THE
TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and the
THRUM of big thrusters.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Come left a little. She’s right in front of
us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. Thirteen… you should see it.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Do you see it? I don’t see it… there!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It still gets me every time.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Is just your guilt because of estealing
from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It still gets me every time… to see the sad
ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the
morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: You are so full of shit, boss.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of
Titanic… two and a half miles down. The pressure is three tons per
square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant
if our hull fails. These windows are nine inches thick and if they go,
it’s sayonara in two microseconds.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Right. Let’s go to work.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Walkin’ the dog.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: I’m in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom
B-54.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Stay off the floor. Don’t stir it up like
you did yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: I’m tryin’ boss.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: I’m crossing the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Okay, I want to see what’s under that
wardrobe door.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein’ what I’m
seein’?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh baby baby baby. It’s payday, boys.</p>
<p><strong>14 ext. stern of deck of kedysh - day</strong>: THE SAFE,
dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of a ship by
a winch cable.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Who’s the best? Say it.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: You are, Lewis. You rolling?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Well, here it is, the moment of truth.
Here’s where we find out if the time, the sweat, the money spent to
charter this ship and these subs, to come out here to the middle of the
North Atlantic… were worth it. If what we think is in that same… is in
that safe… it will be.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and
his career never recovered.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Get that outta my face.</p>
<p><strong>15 int. lab deck, preservation room - day</strong>:
Technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing
them in a tray of water to separate them safely. Nearby, other artifacts
from the stateroom are being washed and preserved.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: You send out what I tell you when I tell
you. I’m signing your paychecks, not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the
uplink.</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: The partners want to know how it’s going?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: How it’s going? It’s going like a first date
in prison, whattaya think?!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn’t in the
safe… no, look, don’t worry about it, there’re still plenty of places it
could be… in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother’s room, in the
purser’s safe on C deck… Hang on a second.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’ll be God damned.</p>
<p><strong>16 insert</strong>: A CNN NEWS STORY: a live satellite feed
from the deck of the Keldysh, intercut with the CNN studio.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best
known for finding Spanish gold in sunken galleons in the Caribbean. Now
he is using deep submergence technology to work two and a half miles
down at another famous wreck… the Titanic. He is with us live via
satellite from a Russian research ship in the middle of the Atlantic…
hello Brock?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not
just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE shipwreck. It’s the Mount Everest of
shipwrecks.</p>
<p><strong>17 int. house / ceramics studio</strong>: PULL BACK from the
screen, showing the CNN report playing on a TV set in the living room of
a small rustic house. It is full of ceramics, figurines, folk art, the
walls crammed with drawings and paintings… things collected over a
lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’ve planned this expedition for three
years, and we’re out here recovering some amazing things… things that
will have enormous historical and educational value.</p>
<p><strong>cnn reporter</strong>: But it’s no secret that education is
not your main purpose. You’re a treasure hunter. So what is the treasure
you’re hunting?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’d rather show you than tell you, and we
think we’re very close to doing just that.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Turn that up please, dear.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Your expedition is at the center of a
storm of controversy over salvage rights and even ethics. Many are
calling you a grave robber.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts
from King Tut’s tomb grave robbing. I have museum-trained experts here,
making sure this stuff is preserved and catalogued properly. Look at
this drawing, which was found today…</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: …a piece of paper that’s been underwater for
84 years… and my team are able to preserve it intanct. Should this have
remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity, when we can see
it and enjoy it now…?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’ll be God damned.</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. keldysh deck - night</strong>: CUT TO KELDYSH. The
Mir subs are being launched. Mir Two is already in the water, and Lovett
is getting ready to climb into Mir One when Bobby Buell runs up to
him.</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: There’s a satellite call for you.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Bobby, we’re launching. See these
submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: No, trust me, you want to take this call.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. lab deck / keldysh - night</strong>: Beull hands
Lovett the phone, pushing down the blinking line. The call is from Rose
and we see both ends of the conversation. She is in her kitchen with a
mystified Lizzy.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you,
Mrs… ?</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: Rose Calvert.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: … Mrs. Calvert?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I was just wondering if you had found the
“Heart of the Ocean” yet, Mr. Lovett.</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: I told you you wanted to take this call.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can
you tell me who the woman in the picture is?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me.</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. ocean - day</strong>: SMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA
STALLION HELICOPTER thundering across the ocean. PAN 180 degrees as it
roars past. There is no land at either horizon. The Keldysh is visible
in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>21 ext. keldysh - day</strong>: Brock and Bodine are watching
Mir 2 being sweng over the side to start a dive.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: She’s a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like
that… what’s her name? That Anastasia babe.</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: They’re inbound.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: She says she’s Rose DeWitt Bukater, right?
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she’d’ve
lived, she’d be over a hundred now.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: A hundred and one next month.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Okay, so she’s a very old goddamned liar. I
traced her as far back as the 20’s… she was working as an actress in
L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named
Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert’s dead, and
from what I’ve heard Cedar Rapids is dead.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: And everyobody who knows about the diamond
is supposed to be dead… or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I
want to hear what she has to say. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>22 ext. keldysh helipad</strong>: IN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST
the helicopter’s wheels bounce down on the helipad.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: S’cuse me, I have to go check our supply of
Depends.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. rose’s stateroom / keldysh - day</strong>: Lizzy is
unpacking Rose’s things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is placing a
number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefully next to
the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Is your stateroom alright?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter,
Lizzy? She takes care of me.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma.
Remember, up on deck?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: There, that’s nice. I have to have my pictures
when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn’t that right, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Would you like anything?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I should like to see my drawing.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. lab deck, preservation area</strong>: Rose looks at
the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across a span of
84 years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it, they
have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone,
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about
the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that
the crown diamond was chopped too… recut into a heart-like shape… and it
became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be
worth more than the Hope Diamond.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it
this once.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: You actually believe this is you,
grandma?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It is me, dear. Wasn’t I a hot number?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I tracked it down through insurance records…
and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you
know who the claiment was, Rost?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel
tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France
for his fiancee… you… a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim
was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to’ve gone down
with the ship. See the date?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: April 14, 1912.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: If your grandma is who she says she is, she
was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: And that makes you my new best friend. I
will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead
to its recovery.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know
how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some
away.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: You don’t want anything?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You may give me this, if anything I tell you
is of value.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Deal. Over here are a few things we’ve
recovered from your staterooms.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the
same as the last time I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: The reflection has changed a bit.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My mother’s brooch. She wanted to go back for
it. Caused quite a fuss.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Are you ready to go back to Titanic?</p>
<p><strong>29 int. imaging shack / keldysh</strong>: It is a darkened
room lined with TV monitors. IMAGES OF THE WRECK fill the screens, fed
from Mir One and Two, and the two ROVs, Snoop Dog and DUNCAN.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Live from 12,000 feet.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: The bow’s struck in the bottom like an axe,
from the impact. Here… I can run a simulation we worked up on this
monitor over here.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: We’ve put together the world’s largest
database on the Titanic. Okay, here…</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No, no. It’s fine. I’m curious.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: She hits the berg on the starboard side and
it sort of bumps along… punching holes like a morse code… dit dit dit,
down the side. Now she’s flooding in the</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: The bow pulls out of its dive and planes
away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe 12
miles an hour. KABOOM!</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: The stern implodes as it sinks, from the
pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls,
landing like a big pile of junk. Cool huh?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Thank you for that fine forensic analysis,
Mr. Bodine. Of course the experience of it was somewhat less
clinical.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Will you share it with us?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: I’m taking her to rest.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Tell us, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s been 84 years…</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Just tell us what you can–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s been 84 years… and I can still smell the
fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been
slept in.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it
was. It really was…</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. southampton dock - day</strong>: SHOT CONTINUES IN A
FLORIOUS REVEAL as the gleaming white superstructure of Titanic rises
mountainously beyond the rail, and above that the buff-colored funnels
stand against the sky like the pillars of a great temple. Crewmen move
across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of the steamer.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It
doesn’t look any bigger than the Mauretania.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: You can be blase about some things, Rose, but
not about Titanic. It’s over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and
far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe… even Turkish
baths.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Your daughter is much too hard to impress,
Ruth. Mind your step.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: So this is the ship they say is
unsinkable.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: It is unsinkable. God himself couldn’t sink
this ship.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Sir, you’ll have to check your baggage
through the main terminal, round that way–</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I put my faith in you, good sir.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: See my man.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: These trunks here, and 12 more in the
Daimler. We’ll have all this lot up in the rooms.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: We’d better hurry. This way, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Look up at the ship, darling, that’s it.
You’re amazed! You can’t believe how big it is! Like a mountain. That’s
great.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Steady!!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sorry squire!</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual
bath.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Honestly, Cal, if you weren’t forever booking
everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal
instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant
family.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was
my darling fiancee’s beauty rituals which made us late.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You told me to change.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I couldn’t let you wear black on sailing day,
sweetpea. It’s bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I felt like black.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Here I’ve pulled every string I could to book
us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites… and
you act as if you’re going to your execution.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: It was the ship of dreams… to everyone
else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in
chains.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: Outwardly I was everything a well brought
up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming.</p>
<p><strong>36 ext. southampton docks / titanic - day</strong>: A VIEW OF
TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above the terminal buildings
like the skyline of a city. The steamer’s whistle echoes across
Southampton.</p>
<p><strong>olaf</strong>: You stupid fishhead. I can’t believe you bet
our tickets.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: You lost our money. I’m just trying to get it
back. Now shutup and take a card.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hit me again, Sven.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The moment of truth boys. Somebody’s life’s
about to change.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s see… Fabrizio’s got niente. Olaf, you’ve
got squat. Sven, uh oh… two pair… mmm. Sorry Fabrizio.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: What sorry? What you got? You lose my
money?? Ma va fa’n culo testa di cazzo–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry, you’re not gonna see your mama again
for a long time…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ‘Cause you’re goin’ to America!! Full house
boys!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I’m
high and you’re dry and… … we’re going to–</p>
<p><strong>l’america!!!</strong>: Olaf balls up one huge farmer’s fist.
We think he’s going to clobber Jack, but he swings round and punches
Sven, who flops backward onto the floor and sits there, looking
depressed. Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who are dancing around,
and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Goin’ home… to the land o’ the free and the
home of the real hot-dogs! On the TITANIC!! We’re ridin’ in high style
now! We’re practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you.
I go to l’America!! To be a millionaire!!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Capito?? I go to America!!</p>
<p><strong>pubkeeper</strong>: No, mate. Titanic go to America. In five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit!! Come on, Fabri! Come on!! It’s been
grand.</p>
<p><strong>pubkeeper</strong>: ‘Course I’m sure if they knew it was you
lot comin’, they’d be pleased to wait!</p>
<p><strong>38 ext. terminal - titanic</strong>: Jack and Fabrizio,
carrying everything they own in the world in the kit bags on their
shoulders, sprint toward the pier. They tear through milling crowds next
to the terminal. Shouts go up behind them as they jostle slow-moving
gentlemen. They dodge piles of luggage, and weave through groups of
people. They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a dead stop…
staring at the cast wall of the ship’s hull, towering seven stories
above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. The Titanic is
monstrous.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait!! We’re passengers!</p>
<p><strong>moody</strong>: Have you been through the inspection
queue?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course! Anyway, we don’t have lice, we’re
Americans. Both of us.</p>
<p><strong>moody</strong>: Right, come aboard.</p>
<p><strong>rowe</strong>: Gundersen. And… Gundersen.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on, Sven.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the
world!</p>
<p><strong>40 ext. titanic and dock - day</strong>: The mooring lines,
as big around as a man’s arm, are dropped into the water. A cheer goes
up on the pier as SEVEN TUGS pull the Titanic away from the quay.</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. aft well deck / poop deck - day</strong>: JACK AND
FABRIZIO burst through a door onto the aft well deck. TRACKING WITH THEM
as they run across the deck and up the steel stairs to the poop deck.
They get to the rail and Jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd on
the dock.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: You know somebody?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course not. That’s not the point. Goodbye!
Goodbye!! I’ll miss you!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Goodbye! I will never forget you!!</p>
<p><strong>ext. southampton dock - day</strong>: The crowd of cheering
well-wishers waves heartily as a black wall of metal moves past them.
Impossibly tiny figues wave back from the ship’s rails. Titanic gathers
speed.</p>
<p><strong>44 ext. river test - day</strong>: IN A LONG LENS SHOT the
prow of Titanic FILLS FRAME behind the lead tug, which is dwarfed. The
bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of the liner’s hull as it moves
down the River Test toward the English Channel.</p>
<p><strong>45 int. third class berthing / g-deck forward - day</strong>:
Jack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both
sides like a college dorm. Total confusion as people argue over luggage
in several languages, or wander in confusion in the labyrinth. They pass
emigrants studying the signs over the doors, and looking up the words in
phrase books.</p>
<p><strong>bjorn</strong>: Where is Sven?</p>
<p><strong>46 int. suite b-52-56 - day</strong>: By contrast, the
so-called “Millionaire Suite” is in the Empire style, and comprises two
bedrooms, a bath, WC, wardrobe room, and a large sitting room. In
addition there is a private 50 foot promenade deck outside.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of
money.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re wrong. They’re fascinating. Like in a
dream… there’s truth without logic. What’s his name again… ?
Picasso.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: He’ll never amount to a thing, trust me. At
least they were cheap.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Put that in the wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: It smells so brand new. Like they built it
all just for us. I mean… just to think that tonight, when I crawl
between the sheets, Iill be the first–</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: And when I crawl between the sheets tonight,
I’ll still be the first.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: S’cuse me, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: The first and only. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. cherbourg harbor, france - late dusk</strong>:
Titanic stands silhouetted against a purple post-sunset sky. She is lit
up like a floating palace, and her thousand portholes reflect in the
calm harbor waters. The 150 foot tender Nomadic lies-to alongside,
looking like a rowboat. The lights of a Cherbourg harbor complete the
postcard image.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. first class reception/ d-deck</strong>: Entering the
first class reception room from the tender are a number of prominent
passengers. A BROAD-SHOULDERED WOMAN in an enormous feathered hat comes
up the gangway, carrying a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porter
running to catch up with her to take the bags.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, I wasn’t about to wait all day for you,
sonny. Take ’em the rest of the way if you think you can manage.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named
Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly. History would call her the
Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west,
and she was what mother called “new money”.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: By the next afternoon we had made our
final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with
nothing out ahead of us but ocean…</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. bow - day</strong>: The ship glows with the warm
creamy light of late afternoon. Jack and Fabrizio stand right at the bow
gripping the curving railing so familiar from images of the wreck. Jack
leans over, looking down fifty feet to where the prow cuts the surface
like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets of water.</p>
<p><strong>52 int. / ext. titanic - series of scenes - day</strong>: ON
THE BRIDGE, CAPTAIN SMITH turns from the binnacle to FIRST OFFICER</p>
<p><strong>captain smith</strong>: Take her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let’s
stretch her legs.</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer bell</strong>: All ahead full!</p>
<p><strong>first officer murdoch</strong>: Twenty one knots, sir!</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: She’s got a bone in her teeth now, eh,
Mr. Murdoch.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: I can see the Statue of Liberty already.
Very small… of course.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: She is the largest moving object ever made by
the hand of man in all history…</p>
<p><strong>59 int. palm court restaurant - day</strong>: CLOSE ON J.
BRUCE ISMAY, Managing Director of White Star Line.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: …and our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews
here, designed her from the keel plates up.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well, I may have knocked her together, but
the idea was Mr. Ismay’s. He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and
so luxurious in its appointments, that its supremacy would never be
challenged. And here she is… …willed into solid reality.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Why’re ships always bein’ called “she”? Is it
because men think half the women around have big sterns and should be
weighed in tonnage? Just another example of the men settin’ the rules
their way.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: You know I don’t like that, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: She knows.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: We’ll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little
mint sauce. You like lamb, don’t you sweetpea?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there,
Cal? Hey, who came up with the name Titanic? You, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability, luxury… and safety–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the
male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you,
Mr. Ismay.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: My God, Rose, what’s gotten into–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: I do apologize.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: She’s a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle
her?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on.</p>
<p><strong>60 ext. poop deck / after decks - day</strong>: Jack sits on
a bench in the sun. Titanic’s wake spreads out behind him to the
horizon. He has his knees pulled up, supporting a leather bound
sketching pad, his only valuable possession. With conte crayon he draws
rapidly, using sure strokes. An emigrant from Manchester named CARTMELL
has his 3 year old daughter CORA standing on the lower rung of the rail.
She is leaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, watching the
seagulls.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s typical. First class dogs come down
here to take a shit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s so we know where we rank in the scheme
of things.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Like we could forget.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Forget it, boyo. You’d as like have angels
fly out o’ yer arse as get next to the likes o’ her.</p>
<p><strong>61 int. first class dining saloon - night</strong>: SLOWLY
PUSHING IN ON ROSE as she sits, flanked by people in heated
conversation. Cal and Ruth are laughing together, while on the other
side LADY DUFF-GORDON is holding forth animatedly. We don’t hear what
they are saying. Rose is staring at her plate, barely listening to the
inconsequential babble around her.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: I saw my whole life as if I’d already
lived it… an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo
matches… always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I
felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me
back, no one who cared… or even noticed.</p>
<p><strong>62 int. corridor / b deck - night</strong>: Rose walks along
the corridor. A steward coming the other way greets her, and she nods
with a slight smile. She is perfectly composed.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. rose’s bedroom - night</strong>: She enters the room.
Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the large vanity
mirror. Just stands there, then–</p>
<p><strong>64 ext. a deck promenade, aft - night</strong>: Rose runs
along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, her hair flying. She is
crying, her cheeks streaked with tears. But also angry, furious! Shaking
with emotions she doesn’t understand… hatred, self-hatred, desperation.
A strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotional display in
public.</p>
<p><strong>65 ext. poop deck - night</strong>: Jack is kicked back on
one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing gloriously overhead.
Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Stay back! Don’t come any closer!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Take my hand. I’ll pull you back in.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I’ll let
go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What do you mean no I won’t? Don’t presume to
tell me what I will and will not do. You don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You would have done it already. Now come on,
take my hand.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re distracting me. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t. I’m involved now. If you let go I
have to jump in after you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Don’t be absurd. You’ll be killed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m a good swimmer.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: The fall alone would kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It would hurt. I’m not saying it wouldn’t. To
be honest I’m a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: How cold?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ever been to Wisconsin?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well they have some of the coldest winters
around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid
me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota… ice-fishing’s
where you chop a hole in the–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I know what ice fishing is!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry. Just… you look like kind of an indoor
girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I’m tellin’ ya, water
that cold… like that right down there… it hits you like a thousand
knives all over your body. You can’t breath, you can’t think… least not
about anything but the pain. Which is why I’m not looking forward to
jumping in after you. But like I said, I don’t see a choice. I guess I’m
kinda hoping you’ll come back over the rail and get me off the hook
here.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s what everybody says. But with all due
respect, I’m not the one hanging off the back of a ship.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on. You don’t want to do this. Give me
your hand.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m Jack Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ve got you. I won’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>rowe</strong>: Here, what’s all this?!</p>
<p><strong>rowe</strong>: Here you, stand back! Don’t move an inch!
Fetch the Master at Arms.</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. poop deck - night</strong>: A few minutes later. Jack
is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS, the closest thing to a
cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is right in front of Jack, and
furious. He has obviously just rushed out here with Lovejoy and another
man, and none of them have coats over their black tie evening dress. The
other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioed blowhard who still
has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who is hunched over crying
on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more concerned with
Jack. He grabs him by the lapels.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: What made you think you could put your hands on
my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were
doing?!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cal, stop! It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: An accident?!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It was… stupid really. I was leaning over and
I slipped.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I was leaning way over, to see the… ah…
propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard… and
Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: You wanted to see the propellers?</p>
<p><strong>gracie</strong>: Women and machinery do not mix.</p>
<p><strong>master at arms</strong>: Was that the way of it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh huh. That was pretty much it.</p>
<p><strong>colonel gracie</strong>: Well! The boy’s a hero then. Good
for you son, well done! So it’s all’s well and back to our brandy,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Let’s get you in. You’re freezing.</p>
<p><strong>gracie</strong>: Ah… perhaps a little something for the
boy?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do
it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Is that the going rate for saving the woman
you love?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Rose is displeased. Mmm… what to do?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner
tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure. Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Good. Settled then.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: This should be amusing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can I bum a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: You’ll want to tie those. Interesting that
the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you still had time
to take of your jacket and shoes. Mmmm?</p>
<p><strong>67 int. rose’s bedroom - night</strong>: As she undresses for
bed Rose sees Cal standing in her doorway, reflected in the cracked
mirror of her vanity. He comes toward her.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I know you’ve een melancholy, and I don’t
pretent to know why.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I intended to save this till the engagement
gals next week. But I thought tonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling
for you…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My God… Cal. Is it a–</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Daimond. Yes it is. 56 carats.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They
call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it’s… it’s
overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: It’s for royalty. And we are royalty.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: There’s nothing I couldn’t give you. There’s
nothing I’d deny you if you would deny me. Open your heart to me,
Rose.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: Of course his gift was only to reflect
light back onto himself, to illuminate the greatness that was Caledon
Hockley. It was a cold stone… a heart of ice.</p>
<p><strong>68 int. keldysh imaging shack</strong>: Without a cut the
wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has appeared around her eyes. But
the eyes themselves are the same.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: After all these years, feel it closing
around my throat like a dog collar.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I can still feel its weight. If you could have
felt it, not just seen it…</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Well, that’s the general idea, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: So let me get this right. You were gonna
kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? That’s great!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Lewis…</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: All you had to do was wait two days!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What
did Hockley do with it after that?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Im afraid I’m feeling a little tired,
Mr. Lovett.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Wait! Can you give us something go on, here.
Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet.
Did he have the combination?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>69 ext. launch area/keldysh deck - day</strong>: As the big
hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over the water. Lovett
walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners’ rep. They weave among
deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys.</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: The partners are pissed.</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: Bobby, buy me time. I need time.</p>
<p><strong>buell</strong>: We’re running thirty thousand a day, and
we’re six days over. I’m telling you what they’re telling me. The hand
is on the plug. It’s starting to pull.</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: Well you tell the hand I need another two
days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby… we’re close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had
the diamond on… now we just have to find out where it wound up. I just
gotta work her a bit more. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a
second.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Don’t you mean work me?</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: Look, I’m running out of time. I need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: I’m not going to help you browbeat my hundred
and</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: one year old grandmother. I came down here to
tell you to back off.</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: Lizzy… you gotta understand something. I’ve
bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I’ve got all my dough tied up
in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what’s
locked inside your grandma’s memory. You see this? Right here?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: That’s the shape my hand’s gonna be when I
hold that thing. You understand? I’m not leaving here without it.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Look, Brock, she’s going to do this her way,
in her own time. Don’t forget, she contacted you. She’s out here for her
own reasons, God knows what they are.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Maybe she wants to make peace with the
past.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: What past? She has never once, not once, ever
said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Then we’re all meeting your grandmother for
the first time.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: You think she was really there?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I’m a believer. She was
there.</p>
<p><strong>70 int. imaging shack</strong>: Bodine starts the tape
recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THE LIVE FEED FROM THE
WRECK–SNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side of the hull, heading
aft. The rectangular windows of A deck march past on the right.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking
how the sunlight felt.</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. b deck titanic - day</strong>: MATCH DISSOLVE from
the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912, passing the end of
the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the sunlight right in
front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking with purpose.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: As if I hadn’t felt the sun in years.</p>
<p><strong>72 int. third class general room</strong>: The social center
of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to the opulence of first
class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are mothers with babies,
kids running between the benches yelling in several languages and being
scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing chess,
girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even an
upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: No Italian? Some little English?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: No, no. Norwegian. Only.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Hello Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello again.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Could I speak to you in private?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh, yes. Of course. After you.</p>
<p><strong>73 ext. boat deck - day</strong>: Jack and Rose walk side by
side. They pass people reading and talking in steamer chairs, some of
whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple. He feels out of place in
his rough clothes. They are both awkward, for different reasons.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So, you got a name by the way?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to
write that down.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Mr. Dawson, I–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack… I feel like such an idiot. It took me
all morning to get up the nerve to face you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, here you are.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Here I am. I… I want to thank you for what you
did. Not just for… for pulling me back. But for your discretion.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re welcome. Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor
little rich girl. What does she know about misery?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s not what I was thinking. What I was
thinking was… what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she
though she had no way out.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t… it wasn’t just one thing. It was
everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in
it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away… just run and run
and run… and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship…
even the Titanic wasn’t big enough. Not enough to get away from them.
And before I’d really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so
furious. I’ll show them. They’ll be sorry!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh huh. They’ll be sorry. ’Course you’ll be
dead.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh God, I am such an utter fool.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That penguin last night, is he one of
them?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is he your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Worse I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone
straight to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So you feel like you’re stuck on a train you
can’t get off ‘cause you’re marryin’ this fella.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes, exactly!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So don’t marry him.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: If only it were that simple.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It is that simple.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh, Jack… please don’t judge me until you’ve
seen my world.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I guess I will tonight.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just some sketches.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack, these are quite good! Really, they
are.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, they didn’t think too much of ’em in
Paree.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh no! Oh, I’m so sorry. Truly!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, they didn’t think too much of ’em in
Paree.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I just seem to spew ’em out. Besides, they’re
not worth a damn anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re deranged!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Well, well…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And these were drawn from life?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yup. That’s one of the great things about
Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You liked this woman. You used her several
times.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She had beautiful hands.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I think you must have had a love affair with
her…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, no! Just with her hands.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see
people.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I see you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wouldn’ta jumped.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. reception room / d-deck - day</strong>: Ruth is
having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYER-EDWARDES, the COUNTESS OF ROTHES,
a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician features. Ruth sees someone
coming across the room and lowers her voice.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this
way. Get up, quickly before she sits with us.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Hello girls, I was hoping I’d catch you at
tea.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: We’re awfully sorry you missed it. The
Countess and I are just off to take the air on the boat deck.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: That sounds great. Let’s go. I need to catch
up on the gossip.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: So you’ve not lit the last four boilers
then?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: No, but we’re making excellent time.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic,
let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to
print. And the maiden voyage of Titnaic must make headlines!</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I prefer not to push the engines until
they’ve been properly run in.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: Of course I leave it to your good offices to
decide what’s best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we
get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. Retire with a
bang, eh, E.J?</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. a deck promenade - day</strong>: Rose and Jack stroll
aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the slanting late-afternoon
light. Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You know, my dream has always been to just
chuck it all and become an artist… living in a garret, poor but
free!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wouldn’t last two days. There’s no hot
water, and hardly ever any caviar.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Listen, buster… I hate caviar! And I’m tired
of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry. Really… I am.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Well, alright. There’s something in me, Jack.
I feel it. I don’t know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I
don’t know… a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan…. a wild pagan spirit…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: …or a moving picture actress!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You’re sad. Sad, sad, sad. You’ve left your
lover on the shore. You may never see him agian. Try to be sadder,
darling.</p>
<p><strong>series of cuts:</strong>: Rose posing tragically at the rail,
the back of her hand to her forehead.</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. a deck promenade / aft - sunset</strong>: Painted
with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck rail aft, shoulder
to shoulder. The ship’s lights come on.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, then logging got to be too much like
work, so I went down to Los Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That’s
a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits
there for ten cents a piece.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: A whole ten cents?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah; it was great money… I could make a
dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided
to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Why can’t I be like you Jack? Just head out
for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we’ll go there, sometime…
to that pier… even if we only ever just talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Alright, we’re going. We’ll drink cheap beer
and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we’ll ride horses on
the beach… right in the surf… but you have to ride like a cowboy, none
of that side-saddle stuff.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can
you show me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure. If you like.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I think I would. And teach me to spit too.
Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It’s unfair.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They didn’t teach you that in finishing
school? Here, it’s easy. Watch closely.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this… you
hawk it down… HHHNNNK!… then roll it on your tongue, up to the front,
like thith, then a big breath and PLOOOW!! You see the range on that
thing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That was great!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Charmed, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: The others were gracious and curious about
the man who’d saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect.
A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Well, Jack, it sounds like you’re a good man
to have around in a sticky spot–</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Why do they insist on always announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Shall we go dress, mother? See you at dinner,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Rose, look at you… out in the sun with no hat.
Honestly!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Son, do you have the slightest comprehension
of what you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Well, you’re about to go into the snakepit. I
hope you’re ready. What are you planning to wear?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I figured.</p>
<p><strong>77 int. molly brown’s stateroom</strong>: Men’s suits and
jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place. Molly is having a
fine time. Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and Molly is tying
his bow tie.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Don’t feel bad about it. My husband still
can’t tie one of these damn things after 20 years. There you go.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I gotta buy everything in three sizes ’cause
I never know how much he’s been eating while I’m away.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: My, my, my… you shine up like a new
penny.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 78 EXT. BOAT DECK / FIRST CLAsS ENTRANCE -
DUSK</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>79 int. upper landing / grand staircase and a-deck</strong>:
Jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out
before him. Overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal
chandelier at its center. Sweeping down six stories is the First Class
Grand Staircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the
time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always
wanted to do it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Dawson! I didn’t recognize you. Amazing! You
could almost pass for a gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>80 int. d-deck reception room</strong>: CUT TO THE RECEPTION
ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. They encounter Molly
Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty broad-shouldered
way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are going into the dining
saloon she walks next to him, speaking low:</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Ain’t nothin’ to it, is there, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and
keep your nose up.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Remember, the only thing they respect is
money, so just act like you’ve got a lot of it and you’re in the
club.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: There’s the Countess Rothes. And that’s John
Jacob Astor… the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there,
Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she’s trying
to hide it. Quite the scandal. And over there, that’s Sir Cosmo and
Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many
talents. Very popular with the royals.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And that’s Benjamin Guggenheim and his
mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children,
of course.</p>
<p><strong>sir cosmo</strong>: Hockley, she is splendid.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gracie</strong>: Cal’s a lucky man. I know him well, and it
can only be luck.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: How can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley
is a great catch.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: J.J., Madeleine, I’d like you to meet Jack
Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>astor</strong>: Good to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston
Dawsons?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It’s a pity we’re both spoken for, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>81 int. dining saloon</strong>: Like a ballroom at the
palace, alive and lit by a constellation of chandeliers, full of
elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from BANDLEADER WALLACE
HARTLEY’S small orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter and move across the
room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear…</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: He must have been nervous but he never
faltered. They assumed he was one of them… a young captain of industry
perhaps… new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club. Mother
of course, could always be counted upon…</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
Mr. Dawson. I hear they’re quite good on this ship.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: THE TABLE. Jack is seated opposite Rose, who
is flanked by Cal and Thomas Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown,
Ismay, Colonel Gracie, the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the
Astors.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The best I’ve seen, m’am. Hardly any rats.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He
was of some assistance to my fiancee last night. This is foie gras. It’s
goose liver.</p>
<p><strong>guggenheim</strong>: What is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing
this… bohemian… up here?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: How do you take your caviar, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Just a soupcon of lemon… …it improves the
flavor with champagne.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it
much.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic.
After that, I’m on God’s good humor.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: You find that sort of rootless existence
appealing, do you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well… it’s a big world, and I want to see it
all before I go. My father was always talkin’ about goin’ to see the
ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You
can’t wait around, because you never know what hand you’re going to get
dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I’ve
been on the road since. Somethin’ like that teaches you to take life as
it comes at you. To make each day count.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Well said, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>colonel gracie</strong>: Here, here.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: To making it count.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: How is it you have the means to travel,
Mr. Dawson?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I work my way from place to place. Tramp
steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic here in a lucky hand at
poker. A very lucky hand.</p>
<p><strong>gracie</strong>: All life is a game of luck.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: A real man makes his own luck, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you
everywhere writing in this little book. Increase number of screws in hat
hooks from 2 to 3. You build the biggest ship in the world and this
preoccupies you?!</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: He knows every rivet in her, don’t you
Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: All three million of them.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: His blood and soul are in the ship. She may
be mine on paper, but in the eyes of God she belongs to Thomas
Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Thankyou, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>83 time transition</strong>: Dessert has been served and a
waiter arrives with cigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start
clipping ends and lighting.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Nest it’ll be brandies in the Smoking
Room.</p>
<p><strong>gracie</strong>: Well, join me for a brandy, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and
congratulate each other on being masters of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>gracie</strong>: Joining us, Dawson? You don’t want to stay
out here with the women, do you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No thanks. I’m heading back.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Probably best. It’ll be all business and
politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn’t interest you. Good of you to
come.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack, must you go?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Time for my coach to turn back into a
pumpkin.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her
palm. Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room.
Rose surreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: “Make
it count. Meet me at the clock”.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. a-deck foyer-night</strong>: Rose crosses the A-Deck
foyer, sighting Jack at the landing above. Overhead is the crystal dome.
Jack has his back to her, studying the ornate clock with its carved
figures of Honor and Glory. It softly strikes the hour.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Want to go to a real party?</p>
<p><strong>85 int. third class general room</strong>: Crow led and alive
with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. An ad hoc band is gathered
near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music on fiddle,
accoridon and tambourine. People of all ages are dancing, drinking beer
and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: May I cut in, miss?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re still my best girl, Cora.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t know the steps.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just move with me. Don’t think.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Wait… stop!</p>
<p><strong>87 int. third class general room</strong>: The scene is rowdy
and rollicking. A table gets knocked over as a drunk crashes into it.
And in the middle of it… Rose dancing with Jack in her stocking feet.
The steps are fast and she shines with sweat. A space opens around them,
and people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster and faster.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How you two doin’?</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: I don’t know hwat she’s say, she don’t
know what I say, so we get along fine.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You think a first class girl can’t drink?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You stupid bastard!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about
the Swede and the Irishman goin’ to the whorehouse?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: So, you think you’re big tough men? Let’s see
you do this.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oooowww! I haven’t done that in years.</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. boat deck - night</strong>: The stars blaze overhead,
so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way. Rose and Jack walk along
the row of lifeboats. Still giddy from the party, they are singing a
popular song “Come Josephine in My Flying Machine”.</p>
<p><strong>jack/rose</strong>: Come Josephine in my flying machine</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Isn’t it magnificent? So grand and
endless.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: They’re such small people, Jack… my crowd.
They think they’re giants on the earth, but they’re not even dust in
God’s eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble… and
someday the bubble’s going to burst.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re not one of them. There’s been a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: A mistake?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong
address.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I did, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Look! A shooting star.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That was a long one. My father used to say
that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I like that. Aren’t we supposed to wish on
it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What would you wish for?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Something I can’t have. Goodnight, Jack. And
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rose!!</p>
<p><strong>89 int. orse and cal’s suite / private promenade -
day</strong>: SUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight
splashing across the promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in
silence. The tension is palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid’s uniform,
pours the coffee and goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I had hoped you would come to me last
night.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I was tired.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt
exausting.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I see you had that undertaker of a manservant
follow me.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: You will never behave like that again! Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m not some foreman in your mills than you
can command! I am your fiancee–</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Yes! You are! And my wife… in practice, if not
yet by law. So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her
husband! I will not be made out a fool! Is this in any way unclear?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We… had a little accident. I’m sorry,
Trudy.</p>
<p><strong>90 int. ruth’s suite - day</strong>: Rose is dressed for the
day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with her corset. The tight
bindings do not inhibit Ruth’s fury at all.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: You are not to see that boy again, do you
understand me Rose? I forbid it!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh, stop it, Mother. You’ll give yourself a
nosebleed.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is
precarious. You know the money’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Of course I know it’s gone. You remind me
every day!</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Your father left us nothing but a legacy of
bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have
to play.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: I don’t understand you. It is a fine match
with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: How can you put this on my shoulders?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Do you want to se me working as a seamstress?
Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an
auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you
be so selfish?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s so unfair.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Of course it’s unfair! We’re women. Our
choices are never easy.</p>
<p><strong>91 int. first class dining saloon</strong>: At the divine
service, Captain Smith is leading a group in the hymn “Almighty Father
Strong To Save.” Rose and Ruth sing in the middle of the group.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Look, you, you’re not supposed to be in
here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was just here last night… don’t you
remember? He’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater
continue to be most appreciative of your assistance. They asked me to
give you this in gratitude–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t want money, I–</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: –and also to remind you that you hold a
third class ticket and your presence here is no longer appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I just need to talk to Rose for a–</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets
back where he belongs. And that he stays there.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Yes sir! Come along you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in
peril on the sea.</p>
<p><strong>92 int. gymnasium - day</strong>: An Edwardian nautilus room.
There are machines we recognize, and some don’t. A woman pedals a
stationary bicycle in a long dress, looking rediculous. Thomas Andrews
is leading a small tour group, including Rose, Ruth and Cal. Cal is
wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a well trained
stroke.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Reminds me of my Harvard days.</p>
<p><strong>mccauley</strong>: The electric horse is very popular. We
even have an electric camel. Care to try your hand at the rowing,
m’am?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Don’t be absurd. I can’t think of a skill I
should likely need less.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The next stop on our tour will be bridge.
This way, please.</p>
<p><strong>93 ext. aft well deck, b-deck and a-deck - day</strong>:
Jack, walking with determination, is followed closely by Tommy and
Fabrizio. He quickly climbs the steps to B-Deck and steps over the gate
separating 3rd from 2nd class.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: She’s a goddess amongst mortal men, there’s
no denyin’. But she’s in another world, Jackie, forget her. She’s closed
the door.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It was them, not her. Ready… go.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He’s not bein’ logical, I tell ya.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Amore is’a not logical.</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. a-deck / aft - day</strong>: A man is playing with
his son, who is spinning a top with a string. The man’s overcoat and hat
are sitting on a deck chair nearby. Jack emerges from behind one of the
huge deck cranes and calmly picks up the coat and bowler hat. He walks
away, slipping into the coat, and slicks his hair back with spit. Then
puts the hat on at a jaunty angle. At a distance he could pass for a
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>95 int. bridge / chartroom - day</strong>: HAROLD BRIDE, the
21 year old Junior Wireless Operator, hustles in and skirts around
Andrews’ tour group to hand a Marconigram to Captain Smith.</p>
<p><strong>bride</strong>: Another ice warning, sir. This one from the
“Baltic”.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Thankyou, Sparks.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Not to worry, it’s quite normal for this time
of year. In fact, we’re speeding up. I’ve just ordered the last boilers
lit.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Did we ever find those binoculars for
the lookouts?</p>
<p><strong>first officer murdoch</strong>: Haven’t seen them since
Southampton.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. boat deck / starboard side - day</strong>: Andrews
leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and
with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned… forgive
me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: About half, actually. Rose, you miss
nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take
an extra row of boats here. But it was thought… by some… that the deck
would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable
ship!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you
a good ship, strong and true. She’s all the lifeboat you need.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. gymnasium - day</strong>: Jack closes the door behind
her, and glances out through the ripple-glass window to the starboard
rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up the woman who was riding
the bike. Rose and Jack are alone in the room.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack, this is impossible. I can’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rose, you’re no picnic… you’re a spoiled
little brat even, but under that you’re a strong, pure heart, and you’re
the most amazingly astounding girl I’ve ever known and–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack, I–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No wait. Let me try to get this out. You’re
amazing… and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But
I’m involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can’t turn away without
knowin’ that you’re goin’ to be alright.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re making this very hard. I’ll be fine.
Really.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t think so. They’ve got you in a glass
jar like some butterfly, and you’re goin’ to die if you don’t break out.
Maybe not right away, ‘cause you’re strong. But sooner or later the fire
in you is goin’ to go out.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s not up to you to save me, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re right. Only you can do that.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I have to get back, they’ll miss me. Please,
Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>98 int. first class loung - day</strong>: The most elegant
room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze Versaille style. Rose sits on a
divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her. Ruth, the
Countess Rothes and Lady Duff-Gordon are taking tea. Rose is silent and
still as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Of course the invitations had to be sent back
to the printers twice. And the bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what
an odyssey that has been…</p>
<p><strong>reverse, rose’s pov</strong>: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER
having tea. The four year old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily
picking up a cookie. The mother correcting her on her posture, and the
way she holds the teacup. The little girl is trying so hard to please,
her expression serious. A glimpse of Rose at that age, and we see the
relentless conditioning… the pain to becoming an Edwardian geisha. ON
ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling tea
all over her dress.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh, look what I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>99 ext. titanic - day</strong>: TITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in
the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of a giant fire. As the ship
looms, FILLING FRAME, we push in on the bow. Jack is there, right at the
apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. He closes his eyes, letting
the chill wind clear his head.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Hello, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Fabrizio said you might be up–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sssshh. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. Open them.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m flying!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come Josephine in my flying machine…</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Wish I had those bleedin’ binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. keldysh imaging shack</strong>: OLD ROSE blinks,
seeming to come back to the present. She sees the wreck on the screen,
the sad ghost ship deep in the abyss.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That was the last time Titanic ever saw
daylight.</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: So we’re up to dusk on the night of the
sinking. Six hours to go.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Don’t you love it? There’s Smith, he’s
standing there with the iceberg warning in his fucking hand… … excuse
me… in his hand, and he’s ordering more speed.</p>
<p><strong>brock</strong>: 26 years of experience working against him.
He figures anything big enough to sink the ship they’re going to see in
time to turn. But the ship’s too big, with too small a rudder… it can’t
corner worth shit. Everything he knows is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. rose’s suite</strong>: … 1912. Like in a dream the
beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery emerge from the rusted ruin.
Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the room. He sets his sketchbood
and drawing materials on the marble table.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Will this light do? Don’t artists need good
light?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Zat is true, I am not used to working in such
’orreeble conditions. Hey… Monet!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Isn’t he great… the use of color? I saw him
once… through a hole in this garden fence in Giverny.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cal insist on luggin this thing
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Should I be expecting him anytime soon?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold
out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is it? A sapphire?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the
Heart of the Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I want you to draw me like your French girl.
Wearing this. Wearing only this.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: The last thing I need is another picture of me
looking like a china doll. As a paying customer, I expect to get what I
want.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Tell me when it looks right to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh… just bend your left leg a little and… and
lower your head. Eyes to me. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I
can’t imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He does landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. keldysh / imaging shack</strong>: MATCH
DISSOLVE/MORPH to Rose, 101 years old. Only her eyes are the same.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: My heart was pounding the whole time. It
was the most erotic moment of my life… up till then at least.</p>
<p><strong>cut to reverse</strong>: A semicircle of listeners staring in
rapt, frozen silence. The story of Jack and Rose has finally and
completely grabbed them.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: What, uh… happened next?</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: You mean, did we “do it”?</p>
<p><strong>107 int. rose and cal’s suite - night</strong>: BACK TO 1912.
Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her kimono again, is leaning
on his shoulder, watching.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this
night.</p>
<p><strong>108 int. first class smoking room - night</strong>: Lovejoy
enters from the Palm Court through the revolving door and crosses the
room toward Hockley. A fire is blazing in the marble fireplace, and the
usual fatcats are playing cards, drinking and talking. Cal sees Lovejoy
and detaches from his group, coming to him.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: None of the stewards have seen her.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.</p>
<p><strong>109 ext. atlantic - night</strong>: TITANIC glides across an
unnatural sea, blakc and calm as a pool of oil. The ships lights are
mirrored almost perfectly in the black water. The sky is brilliant with
stars. A meteor traces a bright line across the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a flat
calm, in 24 years at sea.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of
wind.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: It’s make the bergs harder to see, with
no breaking water at the base.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Mmmmm. Well, I’m off. Maintain speed and
heading, Mr. Lightoller.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: And wake me, of course, if anything becomes
in the slightest degree doubtful.</p>
<p><strong>111 int. rose and cal’s suite</strong>: Rose, fully dressed
now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key in the lock. Rose
takes Jack’s hand and leads him silently through the bedrooms. Lovejoy
enters by the sitting room door.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: Miss Rose? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>112 int. corridor outside suite</strong>: Rose and Jack come
out of her stateroom, closing the door. She leads him quickly along the
corridor toward the B deck foyer. They are halfway across the open space
when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoy comes out.
The valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Take us down. Quickly, quickly!</p>
<p><strong>113 int. e-deck foyer / elevators</strong>: Lovejoy emerges
from another lift and runs to the one Jack and Rose were in. The
Operator is just closing the gate to go back up. Lovejoy runs around the
bank of elevators and scans the foyer… no Jack and Rose. He tries the
stairs going down to F-Deck.</p>
<p><strong>114 int. f-deck corridors / fan room</strong>: A functional
space, with access to a number of machine spaces . Jack and Rose are
leaning against a wall, laughing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: He’s an ex-Pinkerton. Cal’s father hired him
to keep Cal out of trouble… to make sure he always got back to the hotel
with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable
parts of town…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Kinda like we’re doin’ right now– uh oh!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: After you, m’lady.</p>
<p><strong>116 int. boiler room five and six</strong>: Jack and Rose
come down the escape ladder and look around in amazement. It is like a
vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and black figures
moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room,
dodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of
coal.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Carry on! Don’t mind us!</p>
<p><strong>117 int. first class smoking room</strong>: Amid unparalled
luxury, Cal sits at a card game, sipping brandy.</p>
<p><strong>colonel gracie</strong>: We’re going like hell I tel you. I
have fifty dollars that says we make it into New York Tuesday night!</p>
<p><strong>119 int. boiler room six</strong>: The furnaces roar,
silhouetting the glistening stokers. Jack kisses Rose’s face, tasting
the sweat trickling down from her forehead. They kiss passionately in
the steamy, pounding darkness.</p>
<p><strong>120 int. hold #2</strong>: Jack and Rose enter and run
laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. She hugs herself against the
cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where to, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: To the stars.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Au contraire, mon cher.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Put your hands on me Jack.</p>
<p><strong>121 int. wireless room</strong>: A BRILLIANT ARC OF
ELECTRICITY fills frame– the sparks gap of the Marconi instrument as
SENIOR WIRELESS OPERATOR JACK PHILLIPS rapidly keys out a message.
Junior Operator Bride looks through the huge stack of outgoing messages
swamping them.</p>
<p><strong>bride</strong>: Look at this one, he wants his private train
to meet him. La dee da. We’ll be up all bloody night on this lot.</p>
<p><strong>phillips</strong>: Christ! It’s that idiot on the
Californian.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. / ext. wireless shak / freighter
californian</strong>: Wireless Operater CYRIL EVANS pulls his earphone
off his ear as the Titanic’s spark deafens him. he translates the
message for THIRD OFFICER</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Stupid bastard. I try to warn him about the
ice, and he says “Keep out. Shut up. I’m working Cape Race.”</p>
<p><strong>groves</strong>: Now what’s he sending?</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: “No seasickness. Poker business good. Al”.
Well that’s it for me. I’m shutting down.</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. ocean / titanic</strong>: ON TITANIC, steaming
hellbent through the darkness, hurling up white water at the bows. The
bow comes straight at us, until the bow wave WIPES THE</p>
<p><strong>124 int. hold #2</strong>: PUSHING IN on the rear window of
the Renault, which is completely fogged up. Rose’s hand comes up and
slams against the glass for a moment, making a handprint in the veil of
condensation.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re trembling.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s okay. I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can feel your heart beating.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: Well, I wasn’t the first teenage girl to
get seduced in the backseat of a car, and certainly not the last, by
several million. He had such fine hands, artists’ hands, but strong too…
roughened by work. I remember their touch even now.</p>
<p><strong>125 ext. atlantic / titanic - night</strong>: The bow sweeps
under us, and the CAMERA CLIMBS toward the foremast and the tiny
half-cylinder of the crow’s nest, which grows as we push in on lookouts
Fleet and Lee. They are stamping their feet and swinging their arms,
trying to keep warm in the 22 knot freezing wind, which whips capor of
their breath away behind.</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: You can smell ice, you know, when it’s
near.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Bollocks.</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Well I can.</p>
<p><strong>126 int. boiler room six</strong>: Without hearing hte words
over the roar of the furnaces, we see stokers telling TWO STEWARDS which
way Rose and Jack went. The stewards move off toward the forward
holds.</p>
<p><strong>127 int. cal and rose’s suite</strong>: Cal stands at the
open safe. He stares at the drawing of Rose and his face clenches with
fury. He reads the not again: “DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US</p>
<p><strong>both locked in your safe, rose”.</strong>: Lovejoy, standing
behind him, looks over his shoulder at the drawing. Cal crumples Rose’s
not, then takes the drawing in both hands as if to rip it in half. He
tenses to do it, then stops himself.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I have a better idea.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. hold #2 - night</strong>: The two stewards enter.
They have electric torches and play the beams around the hold. They spot
the Renault with its fogged up rear window and approach it slowly.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Got yer!</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: the back seat is empty.</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. forward well deck and crow’s nest - night</strong>:
Rose and Jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto the deck.
They can barely stand, they are laughing so hard.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: When this ship docks, I’m getting off with
you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I know. It doesn’t make any sense. That’s why
I trust it.</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Cor… look at that, would ya.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: They’re a bloody sight warmer than we are.</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Well if that’s what it takes for us two to
get warm, I’d rather not, if it’s all the same.</p>
<p><strong>fleet’s pov</strong>: a massive iceberg right in their path,
500 yards out.</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Bugger me!!</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Pick up, ya bastard.</p>
<p><strong>131 int. / ext. bridge</strong>: Inside the enclosed
wheelhous, SIXTH OFFICER MOODY walks unhurriedly to the telephone,
picking it up.</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Is someone there?</p>
<p><strong>moody</strong>: Yes. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Iceberg right ahead!</p>
<p><strong>moody</strong>: Thankyou. Iceberg right ahead!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Hard a’ starboard.</p>
<p><strong>moody</strong>: Hard’a starboard. The helm is hard over,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>crash sequence / series of cuts:</strong>: 132 CHIEF ENGINEER
BELL is just checking the soup he has warming on a steam manifold when
the engine telegraph clangs, then goes… incredibly… to FULL SPEED
ASTERN. He and the other ENGINEERS just stare at it a second,
unbelieving. Then Bell reacts.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Full astern! FULL ASTERN!!</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: Shut all dampers! Shut ’em!!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Hard a ’port!</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: Go Lads! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Hey, can I get some ice here, please?</p>
<p><strong>148 omitted</strong>: 149 IN THE CROW’S NEST Fleet turns to
his Lee…</p>
<p><strong>fleet</strong>: Oy, mate… that was a close shave.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Smell ice, can you? Bleedin’ Christ!</p>
<p><strong>150 int. / ext. bridge</strong>: CLOSE ON MURDOCH. The alarm
bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming to reflect his inner state. He
is in shock, unable to get a grip on what just happened. He just ran the
biggest ship in history into an iceberg on its maiden voyage.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Note the time. Enter it in the log.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: What was that, Mr. Murdoch?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a’
starboard and run the engines full astern, but it was too close. I tried
to port around it, but she hi… and</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Close the emergency doors.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: The doors are closed.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Find the Carpenter and get him to sound the
ship.</p>
<p><strong>151 int. g-deck forward</strong>: In steerage, Fabrizio comes
out into the hall to see what’s going on. He sees dozens of rats running
toward him in the corridor, fleeing the flooding bow. Fabrizio jumps
aside as the rats run by.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Ma– che cazzo!</p>
<p><strong>tommmy</strong>: Cor!! What in hell–?!</p>
<p><strong>153 int. first class corridor / a-deck</strong>: A couple of
people have come out into the corridor in robes and slippers. A STeWARD
hurries along, reassuring them.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Why have the engines stopped? I felt a
shudder?</p>
<p><strong>steward #1</strong>: I shouldn’t worry, m’am. We’ve likely
thrown a propeller blade, that’s the shudder you felt. May I bring you
anything?</p>
<p><strong>154 ext. forward well deck</strong>: Jack and Rose are
leaning over the starboard rail, looking at the hull of the ship.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Looks okay. I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Could it have damaged the ship?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It didn’t seem like much of a bump. I’m sure
we’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>155 int. steerage forward</strong>: Fabrizio and Tommy are in
a crowd of steerage men clogging the corridors, heading aft away from
the flooding. Many of them have grabbed suitcases and duffel bags, some
of which are soaked.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: If this is the direction the rats were
runnin’, it’s good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. corridor on b deck</strong>: Bruce Ismay, dressed in
pajamas under the topcoat, hurries down the corridor, headed for the
bridge. An officious steward named BARNES comes along the other
direction, getting the few concerned passengers back into their
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>steward barnes</strong>: There’s no cause for alarm. Please,
go back to your rooms.</p>
<p><strong>steward barnes</strong>: Please, sir. There’s no
emergency–</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Yes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the
Master at Arms. Now you moron!</p>
<p><strong>157 int. bridge / chartroom</strong>: C.U. CAPTAIN SMITH
studying the commutator.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: A five degree list in less than ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hutchinson</strong>: She’s making water fast… in the forepeak
tank and the forward holds, in boiler room six.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: Why have we stopped?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: We’ve struck ice.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: Well, do you think the ship is seriously
damaged?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>158 int. boiler room 6</strong>: Strokers and firemen are
struggling to draw the fires. They are working in waist deep water
churning around as it flows into the boiler room, ice cold and swirling
with grease from the machinery. Chief Engineer Bell comes partway down
the ladder and shouts.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: That’s it, lads. Get the hell up!</p>
<p><strong>159 ext. b-deck forward / well deck</strong>: The gentlemen,
now joined by another man, leans on the forward rail watching the
steerage men playing soccer with chunks of ice.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: I guess it’s nothing too serious. I’m
going back to my cabin to read.</p>
<p><strong>yaley</strong>: Say, did I miss the fun?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Can you shore up?</p>
<p><strong>hutchinson</strong>: Not unless the pumps get ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We have to tell Mother and Cal.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now it’s worse.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump…
Right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>160 int. b-deck foyer / corridor</strong>: Jack and Rose
cross the foyer, entering the corridor. Lovejoy is waiting for them in

<p><strong>161 int. rose and cal’s suite</strong>: Cal and Ruth wait in
the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms and two stewards .
Silence as Rose and Jack enter. Ruth closes her robe at her throat when
she sees Jack.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Something serious has happened.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: That’s right. Two things dear to me have
disappeared this evening. Now that one is back… … I have a pretty good
idea where to fine the other. Search him.</p>
<p><strong>master at arms</strong>: Coat off, mate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is horseshit.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cal, you can’t be serious! We’re in the middle
of an emergency and you–</p>
<p><strong>steward barnes</strong>: Is this it?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>master at arms</strong>: Right then. Now don’t make a
fuss.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t you believe it, Rose. Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: He couldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Of course he could. Easy enough for a
professional. He memorized the combination when you opend the safe.</p>
<p><strong>flashback</strong>: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror
and meeting Jack’s eyes as he stands behind her, watching.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: But I was with him the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Maybe he did it while you were putting your
clothes back on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They put it in my pocket!</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: It’s not even your pocket, son. “Property
of A. L. Ryerson”.</p>
<p><strong>master at arms</strong>: That was reported stolen today.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was going to return it! Rose–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rose, don’t listen to them… I didn’t do this!
You know I didn’t! You know it!</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Why do women believe men?</p>
<p><strong>162 int. mail sorting room / hold</strong>: Smith and Andrews
come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds the clerks
scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiously hauling wet
sacks of mail up from the hold below.</p>
<p><strong>163 int. bride / chartroom</strong>: Andrews unrolls a big
drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. It is a side elevation,
showing all the watertight bulkheads. His hands are shaking. Murdoch and
Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: When can we get underway, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Water 14 feet above the keel in ten
minutes… in the forepeak… in all three holds… and in boiler room
six.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Five compartments. She can stay afloat with
the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she
goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the
bulkheads… at E Deck… from one to the next… back and back. There’s no
stopping it.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: The pumps–</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The pumps buy you time… but minutes only.
From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: But this ship can’t sink!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she
can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: How much time?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: An hour, two at most.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Two thousand two hundred souls aboard,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. Ismay.</p>
<p><strong>164 ext. boat deck</strong>: Andrews is striding along the
boat deck, as seamen and officers scurry to uncover the boats. Steam is
venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, and the din is horrendous.
Speech is difficult adding to the crew’s level of disorganization.
Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one of the Wellin
davits and yells to them over the roar of steam.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Turn to the right! Pull the falls taut
before you unchock. Have you never had a boat drill?</p>
<p><strong>seaman</strong>: No sir! Not with these new davits, sir.</p>
<p><strong>165 int. rose and cal’s suite</strong>: From inside the
sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: I had better go dress.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: It is a little slut, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Look at me, you little–</p>
<p><strong>steward barnes</strong>: Sir, I’ve been told to ask you to
please put on your lifebelt, and come up to the boat deck.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Get out. We’re busy.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: I’m sorry about the inconvenience,
Mr. Hockley, but it’s Captain’s orders. Please dress warmly, it’s quite
cold tonight. Not to worry, miss, I’m sure it’s just a precaution.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>166 int. steerage berthing aft</strong>: BLACKNESS. Then
BANG! The door is thrown open and the lights snapped on by a steward.
The Cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep.</p>
<p><strong>steward #2</strong>: Everybody up. Let’s go. Put your
lifebelts on.</p>
<p><strong>steward #2</strong>: Lifebelts on. Lifebelts on. Everybody
up, come on. Lifebelts on…</p>
<p><strong>167 int. wireless room</strong>: ON PHILLIPS, looking
shocked.</p>
<p><strong>phillips</strong>: CQD, sir?</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: That’s right. The distress call. CQD. Tell
whoever responds that we are going down by the head and need immediate
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>phillips</strong>: Blimey.</p>
<p><strong>bride</strong>: Maybe you ought to try that new distress
call… S.O.S. It may be our only chance to use it.</p>
<p><strong>168 ext. boat deck</strong>: Thomas Andrews looks around in
amazement. The deck is empty except for the crew fumbling with the
davits. He yells over the roar of the steam to First Officer
Murdoch.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Where are all the passengers?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: They’ve all gone back inside. Too damn cold
and noisy for them.</p>
<p><strong>169 int. a-deck foyer</strong>: A large number of First Class
passengers have gathered near the staircase. They are getting indignant
about the confusion. Molly Brown snags a passing</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What’s doing, sonny? You’ve got us all
trussed up and now we’re cooling our heels.</p>
<p><strong>young steward</strong>: Sorry, mum. Let me go and find
out.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: It’s just the God damned English doing
everything by the book.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: There’s no need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go
back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won’t be too cold when we
get back.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it
in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The ship will sink.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re certain?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Yes. In an hour or so… all this… will be at
the bottom of the Atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Please tell only who you must, I don’t want
to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don’t wait.
You remember what I told you about the boats?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes, I understand. Thankyou.</p>
<p><strong>170 int. master at arms office</strong>: Lovejoy and the
Master at Arms are handcuffing Jack to a 4” WATER PIPE as a crewman
rushes in anxiously and almost blurts to the Master at Arms–</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: You’re wanted by the Purser, sir.
Urgently.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: Go on. I’ll keep an eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>171 int. bridge</strong>: Junior Wireless Operator Bride is
relaying a message to Captain Smith from the CUNARD LINER CARPATHIA.</p>
<p><strong>bride</strong>: Carpathia says they’re making 17 knots, full
steam for them, sir.</p>

<p><strong>bride</strong>: The only one close, sir. She says they can be
here in four hours.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Four hours!</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Thank you, Bride.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>172 ext. boat deck - night</strong>: Lightoller has his boats
swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all
states of dress and undress. One first class woman is barefoot. Others
are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and
overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are in bathrobes
and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns, then topping
it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, even small
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Hadn’t we better get the women and
children into the boats, sir?</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Right! Start the loading. Women and
children!</p>
<p><strong>hartley</strong>: Number 26. Ready and–</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Ladies, please. Step into the boat.</p>
<p><strong>woman in crowd</strong>: You watch. They’ll put us off in
these silly little boats to freeze, and we’ll all be back on board by
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: My brooch, I left my brooch. I must have
it!</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Stay here, Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>173 int. steerage berthing aft / corridors and
stairwell</strong>: It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through
narrow corridors clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags,
children. Some have lifebelts on, others don’t.</p>
<p><strong>steward #2</strong>: I told the stupid sods no luggage. Aw,
bloody hell!</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Stay calm, please. It’s not time to go up
to the boats yet.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: What are we doing, mummy?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We’re just waiting, dear. When they fiish
putting First Class people in the boats, they’ll be startin’ with us,
and we’ll want to be all ready, won’t we?</p>
<p><strong>174 ext. starboard side</strong>: Boat 7 is less than half
full, with 28 aboard a boat made for 65.</p>

<p><strong>176 ext. boat deck / starboard side, forward</strong>: At the
stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer Boxhall and
Quartermaster Rowe light the first distress rocket. It shoots into the

starbursts which light up the entire deck as they fall.</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: There is no time to waste! Lower away! Lower
away! Lower away!</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Get out of the way, you fool!</p>
<p><strong>ismay</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: You’re a passenger. And I’m a ship’s bloody
officer. Now do what you’re told!</p>

<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You’re afraid, darling. Scared to death.
That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Come on, you heard the man. Get in the boat,
sister.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Will the lifeboats be seated according to
class? I hope they’re not too crowded–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh, Mother shut up! Don’t you understand? The
water is freezing and there aren’t enough boats… not enough by half.
Half the people on this ship are going to die.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Not the better half.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You unimaginable bastard.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. These are the
first class seats right up here. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Come on, Rose. You’re next, darlin’.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Rose, get in the boat!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Goodbye, mother.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be
a whore to that gutter rat?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’d rather be his whore than your wife.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Lower away!!</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Rose! ROSE!!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth. She’ll be
along.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That man tried to take advantage of me in the
crowd!</p>
<p><strong>178 int. boat deck foyer / staircase / a-deck foyer</strong>:
Cal runs in, and down to the landing, pushing past the gentlemen and
ladies who are filling up the stairs. He scans the A-deck foyer. Rose is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>179 ext. ocean / titanic / boat 6</strong>: The hull of
Titanic looms over Boat 6 like a cliff. Its enormous mass is suddenly
threatening to those in the tiny boat. Quartermaster Hitchins, at the
tiller, wants nothing but to get away from the ship. Unfortunately his
two seamen can’t row. They flail like a duck with a broken wing.</p>
<p><strong>hitchins</strong>: Keep pulling… away from the ship.
Pull.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Ain’t you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme
those oars. I’ll show ya how it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>180 int. master at arms office / corridor</strong>: Jack
pulls on the pipe with all his strength. It’s not budging. He hears
gurgling sound. Water pours under the door, spreading rapidly across the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?! This
could be bad.</p>
<p><strong>182 int. first class corridor</strong>: Thomas Andrews is
opening stateroom doors, checking that people are out.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Anyone in here?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master
at Arms take someone under arrest?!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What? You have to get to a boat right
away!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No! I’ll do this with or without your help,
sir. But without will take longer.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Take the elevator to the very bottom, go
left, down the crewman’s passage, then make a right.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Bottom, left, right. I have it.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Hurry, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>183 int. foyer / elevators</strong>: Rose runs up as the last
Elecator Operator is closing up his lift to leave.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sorry, miss, lifts are closed–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m through with being polite, goddamnit!! I
may never be polite the rest of my life! Now take me down!!</p>
<p><strong>184 ext. ocean / boat 6</strong>: Molly and the two seamen
are rowing, and they’ve made it a hundret feet or so. Enough to see that
the ship is angled down into the water, with the bow rail less than ten
feet above the surface.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Come on girls, join in, it’ll keep ya warm.
Let’s go Ruth. Grab an oar!</p>
<p><strong>185 int. first class elevator / corridors</strong>: Through
the wrought iron door of the elevator car Rose can see the decks going
past. The lift slows. Suddenly ICE WATER is swirling around her legs.
She SCREAMS in surprise. So does the operator.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Left, crew passage.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Right, right… right.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack? Jaaacckk??</p>
<p><strong>186 int. master at arms office / corridor</strong>: Jack is
hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until he turns red. He
collapses back on the bench. realizing he’s screwed. Then he hears her
through the door.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ROSE!! In here!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack, Jack, Jack… I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: See if you can find a key for these. Try those
drawers. It’s a little brass one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So… how did you find out I didn’t do it?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I didn’t. I just realized I already knew.</p>
<p><strong>188 ext. titanic / boat one</strong>: While the seamen detach
the falls, Boat One rocks next to the hull. Lucile and Sir Cosmo
Duff-Gordon sit with ten others in a boat made for four times that
many.</p>
<p><strong>lucile</strong>: I despise small boats. I just know I’m going
to be seasick. I always get seasick in small boats. Good Heavens,
there’s a man down there.</p>
<p><strong>189 int. master at arms office</strong>: Rose stops trashing
the room, and stands there, breathing hard.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: There’s no key in here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You have to go for help.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll wait here.</p>
<p><strong>190 int. stairwell and corridors</strong>: Rose splashes down
the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck. She climbs the
stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail. The weight of
it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons and shimmies
quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in her stockings and
knee-length slip, to find herself in–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Hello? Somebody?!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Help me! We need help!</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Come on, then, let’s get you topside, miss,
that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Wait. Wait! I need your help! There’s–</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: No need for panic, miss. Come along!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No, let me go! You’re going the wrong way!</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: To Hell with you!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: See you there, buster!</p>
<p><strong>193 int. master at arms office</strong>: Jack has climbed up
on the bench, and is hugging the waterpipe. Rose wades in, holding the
axe above her head.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Will this work?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Try a couple practice swings.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now try to hit the same mark again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, that’s enough practice.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard as you
can, I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is
cold! Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Too deep. We gotta find another way out.</p>
<p><strong>194 ext. boat 6 and titanic</strong>: TIGHT ON THE LETTERS
TITANIC painted two feet high on the bow of the doomed steamer. Once 50
feet above the waterline, they now quietly slip below the surface. We
see them, gold on black, rippling and dimming to a pale green as they go
deeper.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Now there’s somethin’ you don’t see every
day.</p>
<p><strong>196 int. scotland road / e-deck</strong>: The widest
passageway in the ship, it is used by crew and steerage alike, and runs
almost the length of the ship. Right now steerage passengers move along
it like refugees, heading aft.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Here you! You’ll have to pay for that, you
know. That’s White Star Line property–</p>
<p><strong>jack and rose</strong>: Shutup!</p>
<p><strong>irishwoman</strong>: Here, lass, cover yerself.</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: This’ll take the chill off.</p>
<p><strong>197 ext. boat deck</strong>: ON THE BOAT DECK, the action has
moved to the aft group of boats, numbers 9, 11, 13 and 15 on the
starboard side, and 10, 12, 14 and 16 on the port side. The pace of work
is more frantic. You see crew and officers running now to work the
davits, their previous complacency gone.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Will you hold the boat a moment? I have to
run back to my room for something–</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Why are the boats being launched half
full?!</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Not now, Mr. Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: There, look… twenty or so in a boat built
for sixty five. And I saw one boat with only twelve. Twelve!</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Well… we were not sure of the
weight–</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast with
the weight of 70 men. Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God’s
sake, man!</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: She’s not on the starboard side either.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: We’re running out of time. And this strutting
martinet… …isn’t letting any men in at all.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: The one on the other side is letting men
in.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Then that’s our play. But we’re still going to
need some insurance. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>isador</strong>: Please, Ida, get into the boat.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: No. We’ve been together for forty years, and
where</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: you go, I go. Don’t argue with me, Isador, you
know it does no good.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Lower away!!</p>
<p><strong>198 ext. bridge / forward well deck / foc’sle</strong>: AT
THE BOW… the place where Jack and Rose first kissed… the bow railing
goes under water water. Water swirls around the captsans and windlasses
on the foc’sle deck.</p>
<p><strong>201 int. e-deck corridors and stairwell</strong>: Fabrizio,
standing with Helga Dahl and her family, hears Jack’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fabrizio! Fabri!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: The boats are all going.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We gotta get up there or we’re gonna be
gargling saltwater. Where’s Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>steward #2</strong>: Women only. No men. No men!!</p>
<p><strong>steward #2</strong>: Get back! Get back you lot! Lock
it!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: For the love of God, man, there are children
down here! Let us up, so we can have a chance!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s hopeless that way.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, whatever we’re goin’ to do, we better do
it fast.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Everyone… all of you… come with me now. We
go to the boats. We go to the boats. Capito? Come now!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Helga… per favore… please… come with me, I
am lucky. Is my destiny to go to America.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: I will never forget you.</p>
<p><strong>204 int. cal and rose’s suite</strong>: CLUNK! Cal opens his
safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pulls out two stacks of
bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out “Heart of the
Ocean”, putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks the
safe.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I make my own luck.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>205 int. steerage, aft</strong>: Jack, Rose, Fabrizio and
Tommy are lost, searching for a way out. They push past confused
passengers… past a mother changing her baby’s diaper on top of an
upturned steamer trunk… past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in
Serbo-Croatian, a wailing child next to them… past a man kneeling to
console a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing… and past
another man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out what
the signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Go to the main stairwell, with everyone
else. It’ll all get sorted out there.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Move aside! Quickly, move aside!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: If you have any intention of keeping your
pathetic job</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: with the White Star Line, I suggest you escort
these good people to the boat deck… now.</p>
<p><strong>206 ext. boat 6 / titanic - night</strong>: Ruth rows with
Molly Brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors. She rests on
her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: Come back! Come back to the ship!</p>
<p><strong>hitchins</strong>: The suction will pull us right down if we
don’t keep going.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: We got room for lots more. I say we go
back.</p>
<p><strong>hitchins</strong>: No! It’s our lives now, not theirs. And
I’m in charge of this boat! Now row!!</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: The fools.</p>
<p><strong>210 int. a-deck foyer</strong>: As Cal and Lovejoy cross the
foyer encounter Benjamin Guggenheim and his valet, coth dressed in white
tie, tail-coats and top hats.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Ben, what’s the occasion?</p>
<p><strong>guggenheim</strong>: We have dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down like gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: That’s admirable, Ben. I’ll sure and tell your
wife… when I get to New York.</p>
<p><strong>211 int. first class smoking room</strong>: There are still
two cardgames in progress. The room is quiet and civilized. A silver
serving cart, holding a large humidor, begins to roll slowly across the
room. One of the cardplayers takes a cigar from it as it rolls by.</p>
<p><strong>cardplayer</strong>: It seems we’ve been dealt a bad hand
this time.</p>
<p><strong>212 ext. / int. a-deck promenade</strong>: Cal and Lovejoy
are walking aft with a purposeful stride. They pass CHIEF BAKER JOHGHIN,
who is working up a sweat tossing deck chairs over the rail. After they
go by, Joughin takes a break and pulls a bottle of scotch from a pocket,
opening it. He drains it, and tosses it over the side too, then stands
there a little unteadily.</p>
<p><strong>213 ext. boat deck and a-deck, aft</strong>: PANIC IS SETTING
IN around the remaining boats aft. The crowd here is now a mix of all
three classes. Officers repeatedly warn men back from the boats. The
crowd presses in closer.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Get back! Keep order!</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Lower away left and right!</p>
<p><strong>214 ext. boat deck, starboard side, aft</strong>: Cal and
Lovejoy arrive in time to see Murdoch lowering his last boat.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: We’re too late.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: There are still some boats forward. Stay
with this one… Murdoch. He seems to be quite… practical.</p>
<p><strong>216 ext. boat deck / a-deck, port, aft</strong>: Fifth
Officer Lowe, in Boat 14 is firing his gun as a warning to a bunch of
men threatening to jump into the boat as it passes the open promenade on
A-Deck.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Stay back you lot!</p>
<p><strong>217 ext. boat deck, starboard, aft</strong>: The shots echo
away.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: It’s starting to fall apart. We don’t have much
time.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Mr. Murdoch, I’m a businessman, as you know,
and I have a business proposition for you.</p>
<p><strong>219 ext. boat deck, port</strong>: Jack, Rose et al burst out
onto the boat deck from the crew stairs just aft of the third funnel.
They look at the empty davits.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: The boats are gone!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Colonel! Are there any boats left?</p>
<p><strong>gracie</strong>: Yes, miss… there are still a couple of boats
all the way forward. This way, I’ll lead you!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Music to drown by. Now I know I’m in First
Class.</p>
<p><strong>220 ext. boat deck, starboard, forward</strong>: Water pours
like a spillway over the forward railing on B-Deck. CAMERA SWEEPS UP
past A-Deck to the Boat Deck where Murdoch and his team are loading
Collapsible Car the forward-most davits.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: There are four so-called collapsibles, or
Engelhardts boats, including two which are stored on the roof of the
officer’s quarters. The crowd is sparse, with most people still aft. Cal
slips his hand out of hte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist
pocket of Murdoch’s greatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: So we have an understanding then?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: As you’ve said.</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: I’ve found her. She’s just over on the port
side. With him.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Women and children? Any more women and
children? Any one else, then?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: God damn it to hell! Come on.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Take them down.</p>
<p><strong>221 ext. boat deck / port side - night</strong>: ON THE PORT
SIDE Lightoller is getting people into Boat 2. He keeps his pistol in
his hand at this point. Twenty feet below them the sea is pouring into
the doors and windows of B deck staterooms. They can hear the roar of
water cascading into the ship.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Women and children, please. Women and
children only. Step back, sir.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Goodbye for a little while… only for a
little while. Go with mummy.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Hold mummy’s hand and be a good girl.
That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Please get this to my wife in DeMoines,
Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You better check out the other side.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m not going without you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get in the boat, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Yes. Get in the boat, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: My God, look at you. Here, put this on.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Quickly, ladies. Step into the boat.
Hurry, please!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go on. I’ll get the next one.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. Not without you!</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: There are boats on the other side that are
allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going…
we got our own boat to catch.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Get in… hurry up, it’s almost full.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Lower away!</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: You’re a good liar.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Almost as good as you.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I always win, Jack. One way or another. Pity I
didn’t keep that drawing. It’s going to be worth a lot more by
morning.</p>
<p><strong>222 rose’s perception… in slow motion</strong>: The ropes
going through the pulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going
away… Lightoller giving orders, his lips moving… but Rose hears only the
blood pounding in her ears… this cannot be happening… a rocket bursts
above in slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light… Rose’s hair
blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him…
she sees his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and
cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling… Rose is still staring
up, tears pouring down her face.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No Rose! NOOOO!!</p>
<p><strong>223 int. grand staircase</strong>: TRACKING WITH JACK as he
bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints down the stairs. He
sees her coming into A-deck foyer, running toward him, Cal’s long coat
flying out behind her as she runs.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rose, Rose, you’re so stupid, you’re such an
idiot–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You jump, I jump, right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>224 int. d-deck reception room</strong>: The bottom of the
grand staircase is flooded several feet deep. Jack and Rose come down
the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water, fording across
the room to where the floor slopes up, until they reach dry footing at
the entrance to the dining saloon.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Enjoy your time together!!</p>
<p><strong>lovejoy</strong>: What could possible be funny?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put
my coat… on her.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: I give it to you… if you can get it.</p>
<p><strong>225 int. dining saloon</strong>: Lovejoy moves among the
tables and ornate columns, searching… listening… his eyes tracking
rapidly. It is a sea of tables, and they could be anywhere. A silver
serving tolley rolls downhill, bumping into tables and pillars.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>226 int. galley / stairwell</strong>: They run throught the
galley and Rose spots the stairs. She starts up and Jack grabs her hand.
He leads her DOWN.</p>
<p><strong>227 int. e-deck corridors</strong>: The corridor is awash,
about a foot deep. Standing against the wall, about 50 feet away, is a
little BOY, aobut 3. The water swirls around his legs and he is
wailing.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We can’t leave him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Back! Go back!!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No! Not that way! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>229 int. stairwell</strong>: Jack and Rose pound up the steps
as white water swirls up behind them. PULL BACK to reveal that a steel
gate blocks the top of the stairs. Jack SLAMS against the fate, gripping
the bars.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Help us! Please!</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Fucking ’ell!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>230 ext. boat deck, starboard side</strong>: Cal comes
reeling out of the first class entrance, looking wild-eyed. The lurches
down the deck toward the bridge. Waltz music wafts over the ship.
Somewhere the band is still playing.</p>
<p><strong>cal’s pov</strong>: A little girl, maybe two years old, is
crying along in the alcove. She looks up at Cal beseechingly. Cal moves
on without a glance back… reaching a large crowd clustered around
COLLAPSIBLE A just aft of the bridge. He sees Murdoch and a number of
crewmen struggling to drag the boat to the davits, with no luck. Cal
pushes forward, trying to signal Murdoch, but the officer ignores him.
Nearby Tommy and Fabrizio are being pushed forward by the crowd behind.
PURSER MCELROY pushes them back, getting a couple of seamen to help him.
He brandishes his gun, waving it in the air, yelling for the crowd to
stay back.</p>
<p><strong>231 ext. boat deck, port side / roof of officers’
quarters</strong>: Lightoller, with a group of crew and passengers, is
trying to get Collapsible B down from the roof. They slide it down a
pair of oars leaned against the deck house.</p>
<p><strong>lightoller</strong>: Hold it! Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>233 int. stairwell</strong>: Jack and Rose run up seemingly
endless stairs as the ship groans and torgues around them.</p>
<p><strong>234 ext. boat deck, starboard side</strong>: Murdoch, at
Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd is threatening to rush
the boat. They push and jostle, yelling and shouting at the officers.
The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy falls off the
edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Give us a chance to live, you limey
bastards!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: I’ll shoot any man who tries to get past
me.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: We had a deal, damn you.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>purser mcelroy</strong>: Any more women or children?!</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Here’s a child! I’ve got a child!</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Please… I’m all she has in the world.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: There, there.</p>
<p><strong>235 int. first class smoke room</strong>: Thomas Andrews
stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the large painting above
the mantle. The fire is still going in the fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Won’t you even make a try for it,
Mr. Andrews?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’m sorry that I didn’t build you a
stronger ship, young Rose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s going fast… we’ve got to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Good luck to you, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And to you, Mr. Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>236 ext. boat deck and various locations</strong>: The band
finishes the waltz. Wallace Hartley looks at the orchestra members.</p>
<p><strong>hartley</strong>: Right, that’s it then.</p>
<p><strong>the hymn plays over the following sequence:</strong>: 237 A
seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as he
walks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through
him. Without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the
enclosed WHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the
gleaming brass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boat deck / bridge</strong>: 242 IN A WIDE SHOT we see a
wave travel up the boat deck as the bridge house sinks into the
water.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Get back! You’ll swamp us!</p>
<p><strong>hartley</strong>: Gentlemen, it has been a previlege playing
with you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>248 ext. a-deck aft, port side</strong>: Jack and Rose run
out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. Jack pushes his way to the
rail and looks at the state of the ship. The bridge is under water and
tehre is chaos on deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on. People
stream around them, shouting and pushing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay… we keep moving aft. We have to stay on
the ship as long as possible.</p>
<p><strong>249 ext. forward funnel</strong>: Collapsible A is whirled
like a leaf in the currents around the sining ship. It slams against the
side of the forward funnel.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Row! Row you bastards!!</p>
<p><strong>250 nearby</strong>: Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating
of a STOKEHOLD VENT as water pours through it. The force of tons of
water roaring down the ship traps him against it, and he is dragged down
under the surface as the ship sinks. He struggles to free himself but
cannot. Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as
a furnace explodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator,
ejecting Fabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming.</p>
<p><strong>251 ext. a-deck / b-deck / well deck, aft</strong>: Jack and
Rose clamber over the A-Deck aft rail. Then, using all his strength, he
lowers her toward the deck below, holding on with one hand. She dangles,
then falls. Jack jumps down behind her.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wanna walk a little faster through that
valley, fella?</p>
<p><strong>252 ext. forward funnel</strong>: The stay cables along the
top of the funnel snap, and they lash like steel whips down into the
water. Cal watches as the funnel topples from its mounts. Falling like a
temple pillar twenty eight feet across it whomps into the water with a
tremendous splash. People swimming underneath it disappear in an
instant.</p>
<p><strong>253 int. boat deck foyer / grand staircase</strong>: Water
raors through the doors and windows, cascading down the stairs like a
rapids. John Jacob Astor is swept down the marble steps to A-Deck, which
is already flooded… a roiling vortex. He grabs the headless cherub at
the bottom of the staircase and wraps his arms around it.</p>
<p><strong>255 int. belowdecks</strong>: The flooding is horrific. Walls
and doors are splintered like kindling. Water roars down corridors with
pile-driver force.</p>
<p><strong>256 ext. stern</strong>: Rose and Jack struggle to climb the
well deck stairs as the ship tilts. Drunk Baker Joughin puts a hand
squarely on Rose’s butt and shoves her up onto the deck.</p>
<p><strong>joughin</strong>: Sorry, miss!</p>
<p><strong>260 ext. stern</strong>: ON THE POOP DECK Jack and Rose
struggle aft as the angle increases. Hundreds of passengers, clinging to
every fixed object on deck, huddle on their knees around FATHER BYLES,
who has his voice raised in prayer. They are praying, sobbing, or just
staring at nothing, their minds blank with dread.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on, Rose. We can’t expect God to do all
the work for us.</p>
<p><strong>father byles</strong>: …and I saw new heavens and a new
earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away and the
sea was no longer.</p>
<p><strong>father byles</strong>: I also saw a new Jerusalem, the holy
city coming down out of heaven from God, beautiful as a bride prepared
to meet her husband. I heard a loud voice from the throne ring out this
is God’s dwelling among men. He shall dwell with them and they shall be
his people and He shall be their God who is alway with them.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Shhh. Don’t cry. It’ll be over soon,
darling. It’ll all be over soon.</p>
<p><strong>father byles</strong>: He shall wipe every tear from their
eyes. And there shall be no more death or mourning, crying out or pain,
for the former world has passed away.</p>
<p><strong>int. ship– various</strong>: As the ship tilts further
everything not bolted down inside shifts.</p>
<p><strong>ext. titanic / boat 6</strong>: 268 TRACKING SLOWLY IN on
Ruth as the sounds of the dying ship and the screaming people come
across the water.</p>
<p><strong>269 reverse / her pov</strong>: IN A WIDE SHOT we see the
spectacle of the Titanic, her lights blazing, reflecting in the still
water. Its stern is high in the air, angles up over forty five degrees.
The propellers are 150 feet out of the water. Over a thousand passengers
cling to the decks, looking from a distance like a swarm of bees. The
image is shocking, unbelieveable, unthinkable. Ruth stares at the
spectacle, unable to frame it or put it into any proportion.</p>
<p><strong>molly brown</strong>: God Almighty.</p>
<p><strong>270 int. engine room</strong>: In darkness Chief Engineer
Bell hangs onto a pipe at the master braker panel. Around him men climb
through tilted cyclopean mahcines with electric hand-torches. It is a
black hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, and groaning machinery
threatening to tear right out of its bedplates.</p>
<p><strong>271 ext. titanic</strong>: WIDE SHOT. The lights go out all
over the ship. Titanic becomes a vast black silhouette against the
stars.</p>
<p><strong>in collapsible c</strong>: BRUCE ISMAY has his back to the
ship, unable to watch the great steamer die. He is catatonic with
remorse, his mind overloaded. He can avert his eyes, but he can’t block
out the sounds of dying people and machinery. A loud CRACKING REPORT
comes across the water.</p>
<p><strong>272 ext. boat deck</strong>: Near the third funnel a man
clutches the ship’s rail. He stares down as the DECK SPLITS right
between his feet. A yawning chasm opens with a THUNDER of breaking
steel</p>
<p><strong>273 int. engine room</strong>: It is a thundering black hell.
Men scream as monstrous machinery comes apart around them, steel frames
twisting like taffy. Their torches illuminate the roaring, foaming demon
of water as it races at the through the manchines. Trying to climb they
are overtaken in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>274 ext. titanic - night</strong>: The STERN ALF of the ship,
almost four hundred feet long, falls back toward the water. On the poop
deck everyone screams as they feel themselves plummeting. The sound goes
up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium when a run is scored.</p>
<p><strong>several people</strong>: We’re saved!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We have to move!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on! I’ve got you!</p>
<p><strong>joughin</strong>: Helluva night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Take a deep breath and hold it right before we
go into the water. The ship will suck us down. Kick for the surface and
keep kicking. Don’t let go of my hand. We’re gonna make it Rose. Trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>279 ext. ocean / underwater and surface</strong>: Bodies are
whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling spasmodically,
as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them.</p>
<p><strong>281 at the surface</strong>: a roiling chaos of screaming,
thrashing people. Over a thousand people are now floating where the ship
went down. Some are stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying,
praying, moaning, shouting… screaming. Jack and Rose surface among them.
They barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them.
People driven insane by the water, 4 degrees below freezing, a cold so
intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Swim, Rose! SWIM!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can
do it.</p>
<p><strong>283 ext. ocean</strong>: Jack strokes rhythmically, the
effort keeping him from freezing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look for something floating. Some debris…
wood… anything.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s so cold.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know. I know. Help me, here. Look
around.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s just enough for this lady… you’ll push it
under.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Let me try at least, or I’ll die soon.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ll die quicker if you come any closer.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes, I see. Good luck to you then. God
bless.</p>
<p><strong>284 ext. collapsible a / ocean</strong>: The boat is
overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the sides in the water.
Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standing in
the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Stay back! Keep off!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: You don’t… understand… I have… to get… to
America.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: It’s that way!</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio’s pov</strong>: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and
wielding the oar. A demon in a tuxedo. The image fades to black.</p>
<p><strong>285 ext. ocean</strong>: JACK AND ROSE still float amid a
chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship’s officer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER
WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously, knowing the sound will carry
over the water for miles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on
just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now
they’ll be coming back.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Thank God for you Jack.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Come back! Please! We know you can hear us.
For God’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Please… help us. Save one life! SAVE ON
LIFE!</p>
<p><strong>286 ext. lifeboats / ocean</strong>: IN BOAT 6: Ruth has her
ears covered against the wailing in the darkness. The first class women
in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds of hundreds
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>hitchins</strong>: They’ll pull us right down I tell ya!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Aw knock it off, yer scarin’ me. Come on
girls, grab your oars. Let’s go. Well come on!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I don’t understand a one of you. What’s the
matter with you? It’s your men back there! We got plenty a’ room for
more.</p>
<p><strong>hitchins</strong>: If you don’t shut that hole in yer face,
there’ll be one less in this boat!</p>
<p><strong>287 in boat one</strong>: Sir Cosmo and Lucile Duff-Gordon
sit with ten other people in a boat that is two thirds empty. They are
two hundred yards from the screaming in the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>fireman hendrickson</strong>: We should do something.</p>
<p><strong>sir cosmo</strong>: It’s out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>288 ext. ocean</strong>: Jack and Rose drift under the
blazing stars. The water is glassy, with only the faintest undulating
swell. Rose can actually see the stars reflecting on the black mirror of
the sea.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s getting quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just a few more minutes. It’ll take them a
while to get the boats organized…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know about you, but I intend to write
a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I love you Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… don’t say your good-byes, Rose. Don’t you
give up. Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m so cold.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re going to get out of this… you’re going
to go on and you’re going to make babies and watch them grow and you’re
going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do
you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I can’t feel my body.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that
ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It brought me to you. And I’m thankful, Rose.
I’m thankful.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You must do me this honor… promise me you will
survive… that you will never give up… no matter what happens… no matter
how hopeless… promise me now, and never let go of that promise.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Never let go.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I’ll
never let go.</p>
<p><strong>289 ext. lifeboats / ocean - night</strong>: Fifth Officer
Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten Boats 10, 12 and
Collapsible D together with his own Boat 14. A demon of energy, he’s had
everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from 14
into the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Right, man the oars.</p>
<p><strong>290 ext. ocean / boat 14</strong>: The beam of an electric
torch plays across the water like a searchlight as boat 14 comes toward
us.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: We waited too long.</p>
<p><strong>291 ext. ocean</strong>: IN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE we see Jack
and Rose floating in the black water. The stars reflect in the mill pond
surface, and the two of them seem to be floating in interstellar space.
They are absolutely still. Their hands are locked together. Rose is
staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling above her. The music is
transparent, floating… as the long sleep steals over Rose, and she feels
peace.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: “Come Josephine in my flying machine…”</p>
<p><strong>rose’s pov</strong>: The stars. Like you’ve never seen them.
The Milky Way a glorious band from horizon to horizon. A SHOOTING STAR
flares… a line of light across the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>rose’s pov… slow motion</strong>: The silhouetter of a boat
crossing the stars. She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift
out of the syrupy water, leaving weightless pearls floating in the air.
The VOICES of the men sound slow and DISTORTED. Then the lookout flashes
his torch toward her and the light flares across the water, silouetting
the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past her motionless form and
moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past her. The men look
away.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I won’t let go. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Row back! That way! Pull!</p>
<p><strong>295 int. imaging shack / keldysh</strong>: EXTREME CLOSEUP of
Rose’s ancient, wrinkled face. Present day.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: Fifteen hundred people went into the sea
when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby
and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself
included. Six out of fifteen hundred.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: Afterward, the seven hundred people in the
boats had nothing to do but waith… wait to die, wait to live, wait for
an absolution which would never come.</p>
<p><strong>296 ext. lifeboats / open sea - pre-dawn</strong>: MATCHING
MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: ANOTHER BOAT, and then ANOTHER, seeing
faces we know among the survivors: Ismay in a trance, just staring and
trembling… Cal, sipping from a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced
stoker… Ruth hugging herself, rocking gently.</p>
<p><strong>in boat 14</strong>: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her
face is visile, white as the moon. The man next to her jumps up,
pointing and yelling. Soon everyone is looking and shouting excitedly.
In Rose’s POV it is all silent,</p>
<p><strong>slow motion.</strong>: IN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE we see Lowe
light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts and cheers. Rose
doesn’t react. She floats beyond all human emotion.</p>
<p><strong>298 ext. lifeboats / open sea - dawn</strong>: Golden lgiht
washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm sea reflecting the
rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships, are
icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits nearby, as boats row toward her.</p>
<p><strong>299 ext. lifeboats / ocean / carpathia montage -
day</strong>: IMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship’s hull looming,
with the letters CARPATHIA visible on the bow… Rose watching, rocked by
the sea, her face blank… seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to
the Carpathia’s gangway doors… two women crying and hugging each other
inside the ship… ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, so
gentle and sad, part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost
forever.</p>
<p><strong>300 ext. deck / carpathia - day</strong>: It is the afternoon
of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck,
looking for Rose. The deck of Carpathia is crammed with huddled people,
and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatch cover sits an
enormous pile of lifebelts.</p>
<p><strong>carpathia steward</strong>: You won’t find any of your people
back here, sir. It’s all steerage.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Rose… your mother and I have been looking for
you–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Please don’t. Don’t talk. Just listen. We will
make a deal, since that is something you understand. From this moment
you do not exist for me, nor I for you. You shall not see me again. And
you will not attempt to find me. In return I will keep my silence. Your
actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep
the honor you have carefully purchased.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Is this in any way unclear?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: What do I tell your mother?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Tell her that her daughter died with the
Titanic.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: You’re precious to me, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: That was the last time I ever saw him. He
married, of course, and inherited his millions. The crash of 28 hit his
interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. His children
fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Dawson. Rose Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: Can you exchange one life for another? A
caterpillar turns into a butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why
couldn’t I? Was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the
Titanic?</p>
<p><strong>303 int. imaging shack / keldysh</strong>: Old Rose sits with
the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by the blue glow of the screens. She
holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her gnarled
hands.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: We never found anything on Jack. There’s no
record of him at all.</p>
<p><strong>old rose</strong>: No, there wouldn’t be, would there? And
I’ve never spoken of him until now, not to anyone. Not even your
grandfather. A woman’s heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you all
know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me, in every
way that a person can be saved. I don’t even have a picture of him. He
exists now only in my memory.</p>
<p><strong>305 ext. ocean floor / titanic wreck</strong>: The Mir
submersibles make their last pass over the ship. We hear Yuri the pilot
on the UQC:</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Mir One returning to surface.</p>
<p><strong>306 ext. keldysh deck</strong>: A desultory wrap party for
the expedition is in progress. There is music and some of the Russian
crew are dancing. Bodine is getting drunk in the aggressive style of
Baker Joughin.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: We were pissin’ in the wind the whole
time.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>307 ext. keldysh stern deck</strong>: Rose walks through the
shadows of the deck machinery. Her nightgown blows in the wind. Her feet
are bare. Her hands are clutched at her chest, almost as if she is
praying.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Grandma, wait!! Don’t–</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Don’t come any closer.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: You had it the entire time?!</p>
<p><strong>flash cut to</strong>: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking
away from Pier 54. The photographers’ flashes go off like a battle
behind her. She has her hands in her pockets. She stops, feeling
something, and pulls out the necklace. She stares at it in amazement.
BACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock’s incomprehension.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: The hardest part about being so poor, was
being so rich. But every time I though of selling it, I though of Cal.
And somehow I always got by without his help.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Don’t drop it Rose.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Rush her.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It’s hers, you schmuck. Look, Rose, I… I
don’t know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when
it’s not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is… we’re not dealing
with logic here, I know that… but please… think about this a second.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I have. I came all the way here so this could
go back where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose.
Please. Just once.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You look for treasures in the wrong place,
Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless, and making each day count.</p>
<p><strong>bodine</strong>: Aww!! That really sucks, lady!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Would you like to dance?</p>
<p><strong>309 int. rose’s cabin / keldysh</strong>: A GRACEFUL PAN
across Rose’s shelf of carefully arranged pictures:</p>
<p><strong>blackness</strong>: 310 THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a
ghost out of the dark. It is lit by a kind of moonlight, a light of the
mind. We pass over the endless forecastle deck to the superstructure,
moving faster than subs can move… almost like we are flying.</p>
