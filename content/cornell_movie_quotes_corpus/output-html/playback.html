<p><strong>canadian official</strong>: Good afternoon. You name,
please.</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: George Olson.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Better stop while it’s still perfect.</p>
<p><strong>canadian official</strong>: And where were you born,
Mr. Olson?</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Waukegan, Illinois.</p>
<p><strong>unknown woman</strong>: Is there something I can do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: There are a lot of things you could do for
me.</p>
<p><strong>immigration inspector</strong>: And this is your wife,
Mr. Olson?</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Yes. She was born in Waukegan, too. Same
as Jack Benny, you know.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Jack Benny?</p>
<p><strong>unknown woman</strong>: Well, there is something you could do
for me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’d be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>unknown woman</strong>: You can move to one side. So my
husband can get in.</p>
<p><strong>customs official</strong>: Any firearms? Dutiable articles of
any kind, Mr. Olson?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Would you care to see the Seattle
paper?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No thanks, I’ve seen Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: My name’s Larry Mitchell. I live in
Vancouver.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Same as an hour ago. Remember? I’m the
steady type.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do about it,
Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You could tell me your name. And where
you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How far does this train go?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Vancouver, B.C.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: O.K. Be rugged.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You’re next for the Immigration and
Customs. I trust your papers are all in order.</p>
<p><strong>canadian immigration official</strong>: I hope you will enjoy
your stay in Canada, Mr. Olson.</p>
<p><strong>olson’s voice</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>canadian immigration official</strong>: Your name,
please.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Betty.. Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Betty Mayfield. Miss or Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Miss Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: And where were you born, Miss
Mayfield?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: New York, City.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: I see you are wearing a wedding ring.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ve been married. My Husband..</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Then I take it Mayfield was not your
married name?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ve wired ahead to–</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Inspector Gillette, Isn’t it? I’m Larry
Mitchell. We’ve met before, several times.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I cross the border so often I carry an
identification card.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Yes, I remember you, Mr. Mitchell. You
know this lady?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Very well. Since 1940, at least. I met
her–let me see–it was New York City, wasn’t it Betty?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: How long do you expect to be in Canada,
Miss Mayfield?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh.. a month.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Thank you. I hope you have a pleasant
trip.</p>
<p><strong>customs inspector</strong>: Any firearms? Dutiable articles
of any kind?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>customs official</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: My suitcases are open in the next
room.</p>
<p><strong>customs inspector</strong>: Anything dutiable,
Mr. Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>customs inspector</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Better get rid of the wedding ring. That’s
what threw him.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Trouble?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Or Reno? They always throw them off the
bridge there, I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Perhaps I don’t take it so lightly.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal.
It’s pretty crowded you know.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver
Royal. Should I have a reservation?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ll make one for you. I live there.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well..</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: A very small service. It doesn’t even ask
for thanks. How long for?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I really don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Indefinitely?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>hotel clerk</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Mitchell. Have a
mice trip? Glad to see you back.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Fine, thanks. This is Miss Betty Mayfield.
You have a reservation for her.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Miss Mayfield. Yes, indeed. A balcony room on
the top floor, Magnificent view. Nothing above it but the penthouse.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I’m getting positively haggard. In a couple
of years people will be describing me as well preserved.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with
us again.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I couldn’t care less.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: And with a very beautiful girl, if my
eyes don’t deceive me at this distance.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I don’t think I want any tea.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Mr. Larry Mitchell, please No, never
mind.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m afraid you’re not very glad to see me,
Margo.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: With your charm? How could I help it? Have a
nice trip?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: So-so.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Who’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Her name’s Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: She’s just a girl I met on the train. You
don’t mind do you?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Why should I mind?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You shouldn’t. You washed me up very
thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: As thoroughly as I could. It wasn’t easy. But
you are helping me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Margo, darling. You washed me up.
Remember? We’re just friends. You wanted it that way.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: She’s very beautiful. She’s much younger than
I am. And she’s rich, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Rich? I haven’t the faintest idea.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You ought to know why.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I don’t. My hunch is she’s just torn up an
unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Splendid. Now she can return the
compliment.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: She can give you enough money to cover these…
and the other bad checks you’ve given me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I hoped to get enough to cover them before
they cleared. I wasn’t lucky.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You know what would happen to you if I turned
these over to the police?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I have a rough idea.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You’d go to jail. For a long term.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Correct. I couldn’t even afford to pay a
lawyer to defend me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What’ll we do about it, Margo?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: She is much younger than I am. That’s
something I’m going to have to get used to. Isn’t it, Larry? They’ll all
be much younger than I am. Here. Tear them up.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I guess I’m still in love with you, Larry.
What an idiot!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ve always been a heel. I guess I always
will be.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You don’t have to make a pose of it.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s the only pose I have left. I’m sunk.
Broke. I don’t even have my hotel bill.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I seem to recognize this routine. First the
kiss then the touch. Oh, what’s the use. You’re you.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I only have a couple of hundred.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I seem to remember that you like to help
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s not very kind.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Kind or not kind. What’s the difference? It
always ends up the same way.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What does it look like?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How long have you had it?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Years, why?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s against the law to cross the border
with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You already have the checks, darling.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I didn’t mean it that way I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon’s throwing a
party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: How about your new friend?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I told you she’s just..</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my
bringing it up again. Be back in an hour. Right?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: In an hour, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: A little something on account perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Rather more than a little something,
Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m afraid this is all for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I think we’d better discuss this in my
office, Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will
shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Oh, I forgot. I have a dinner engagement.
Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely
view too.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Very nice Mitchell turns.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No thanks?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Suppose I hadn’t known that immigration
inspector? Hadn’t put in a good word for you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m supposing.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I think you’re a nice girl. I like you.
But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner
more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector. A sort of
tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I have a darned good idea you’re name
isn’t Betty Mayfield at all.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How about taking to Uncle Larry into the
old firm? He’s a useful guy to have on your side.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, Betty. I’m not
suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Dine and dance tonight? I’ve got fifty
bucks to throw away.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m not in the mood for dining and
dancing.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: We have some nice places around
Vancouver.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sure you have.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Well, how about a breeze up to the
penthouse about six o’clock? A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail
party up there.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I haven’t been invited.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon’s
parties. They just go.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Perhaps I’d better get you straightened out,
Mr. Mitchell. You’ve been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And
I’m grateful. But I don’t think this entitles you to put me on a
leash.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Nobody I’d rather have on a leash.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m awfully sorry, but I’d like to take a
bath and get freshened up.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The brush-off, huh?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m trying very hard to be polite about
it.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Don’t I even get my face slapped?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Okay. You win.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: If you change your mind about the cocktail
party, or anything else, give me a buzz.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If I change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You can have the table yourself, if you’d
rather. I’m only killing time.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, please.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Sit down then. We often have a double up
here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Oh waiter.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’d like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian
law.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Beer? Well, all right.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Beer or ale, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ale. I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Right, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Your liquor laws..</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Disgusting, aren’t they? If you really want
a Martini, I know where you can get one.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse
here. He’s holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It might be worth a Martini to you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t need it that badly. I don’t enjoy
crashing other people’s parties.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s open-house. No crashing involved.
Anybody in the hotel’s welcome.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What did you say his name was?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my
age. Lot of money… that he didn’t make. Former American. Now naturalized
in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect.
Scotch superb.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You don’t sound as if you liked him very
much.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No.. not very well. And I like his friends
even less. But.. If you really want a good dry Martini..</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: As I said before…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Sure. But I’d hate like the Dickens to be
held to everything I’ve said before, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re not paying for this. It’s quite enough
that you let me sit at your table.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I never pay for anything. They just keep me
here to amuse the guests.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And do you amuse the guests?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No. Are you really going to drink that
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re drinking it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I can be talked out of it. As a matter of
fact, I’d like a dry Martini myself.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Would it make you anymore amusing?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know you and you don’t know me. I
made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I’m sure you’d rather be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I hate to be alone. But I’ve heard all the
approaches there are… even yours.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Neatly said…but to the wrong man. The
trouble with pretty girls is that they can’t imagine anyone thinking of
anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you think I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Thanks for the fresh air. That felt
good.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re sure Mr. Brandon won’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He doesn’t even know half the people who
come up to drink his liquor.</p>
<p><strong>camera pans brandon and betty over towards the bar,</strong>:
DISCOVERING Mitchell leaning against it, staring morosely into a drink.
He drains the last of it.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Another.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This lady would like a dry Martini. So
would I.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Well well. Baby wouldn’t come with me.
Where did you pick her up?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The liquors lovely. The rest of the party
you can have.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What’s the matter, baby. Don’t you like me
anymore?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Lay off, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Lay off what? This is my new girl friend.
Met her on the train. She’s very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn’t
it, baby?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: And I’d begun to think this was my lucky
day.</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: You’re wanted on the telephone,
Mr. Brandon. Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Thanks. If you are a friend of Larry
Mitchell’s I’m sure I leave you in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hello Margo. Aren’t you coming up?
Mitchell? Oh yes, he’s here. He came up alone, but it seems he has a new
girl friend with him now. Don’t be theatrical, Margo. What do you care
about Mitchell? Come on up and have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I haven’t any intensions of being theatrical.
Of course I’ll come up. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>elevator boy</strong>: Did you have a nice day,
Mrs. West?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I had a rotten day, if its any of your
business.</p>
<p><strong>elevator boy</strong>: I’m terribly sorry, Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Don’t let it break you up.</p>
<p><strong>elevator boy</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m terribly sorry, Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Oh, the Coldstream Guards. Don’t you take
your hat off in elevators?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I never wear a hat. Oh, so I am. I forgot.
I guess I’m terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>elevator boy</strong>: Penthouse floor, please.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: May you what?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Oh nothing.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Are you always this witty?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come
together?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: In the same elevator. It is a public
conveyance.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Let me introduce you. Mr. Killaine,
Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Fascinated.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’ll you have, Margo?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Martini.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You, Killaine?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Scotch and plain water, I think.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Warm water, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: A private joke.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: It goes with this… cold houses and warm
drinks…the effete Englishman.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re not English.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m sorry. I forgot about calling for
you.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: It’s quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After
all, you got what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Be nasty.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I have no intension of being nasty,
Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: In that case, there’s someone here I’d
like to introduce to you. Over there.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: She is beautiful. And young. No thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I say YES!</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You’re not the type to be masterful, darling.
It takes character.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Of course, darling. Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That’s what I like about cocktail parties.
Everyone is so perfectly natural.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How’s life treating you?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: The usual grind.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Round of golf Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: If I can get off.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to
meet you. Miss Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You’re very attractive, my dear. And you look
very unsophisticated.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Unsophisticated? If I knew about this
babe…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I think I’d like to dance.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Why certainly, baby.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Please be a little more careful how you talk,
Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How careful should I be?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t like being referred to as babe, or
addressed as baby. I don’t like your possessive attitude, nor your hints
of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don’t
think I like you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Maybe you’re going to have to like me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You’ve shed the ring, haven’t you? Took my
advice. That’s the girl. Keep right on taking my advice and we’ll get
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I think you’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Just drunk enough.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What’s the matter, baby? Don’t you like
being kissed?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell…
..don’t. I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a
nice secluded park bench.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Did I do something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I wouldn’t know. Just do it somewhere else.
There is such a thing as good manners.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How would you know, Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Want to walk out… or get thrown out?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You don’t throw guests out, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Don’t bet on it. I’m eccentric.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: It takes two to clinch. Clark. Nice to have
seen you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Dance?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: Where I come from, Mr. Brandon, the host
tries to protect his guests from insult.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I stopped him.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: And if he fails, he at least has the good
manners to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t exactly regard Larry Mitchell’s
pick-ups…</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: We haven’t been introduced. But if you’ll
overlook that, I’m sure that between us we can contrive a graceful
exit.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Would it have helped if I’d knocked him
down?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Hardly. Who’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I
don’t even know her name.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: She doesn’t look like a girl who would let
herself be picked up on a train.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s what I thought, at first. Maybe
somebody else ought to have thrown this party. With my liquor of
course.</p>
<p><strong>int. county courthouse - greenwater north carolina
–</strong>: NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Everybody stand up! His Honor, Judge
Hopkinson! Court now in session!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Bailiff, please make room for Mr. Henry
Kinsolving, outside the bar of the court.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Before the Jury renders its verdict, the
Court wishes to warn those present that there is to be no demonstrations
of any kind. No person is to leave the courtroom until the Court rises.
I repeat… no one is to leave the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You may proceed, Mr. Clerk.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The Defendant will rise and face the
Jury.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Gentlemen of the Jury, have you reached a
verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We have.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: And what is your verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We the Jury, find the Defendant, Elizabeth
Kinsolving, guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>
<p><strong>leamington</strong>: Motion to pool the Jury, if it please
the Court.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: So ordered.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Speak a little louder please.</p>
<p><strong>juror no. 7</strong>: Guilty of murder in the first
degree.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Order in the Court!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The Court now has a statement to make.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please sit down, Mrs. Kinsolving.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This court, like most courts, has
occasionally been guilty of judicial error. Prior to the commencement of
this trail, Mr. Leamington, as attorney for the Defendant, made a motion
for a change of venue on the ground that a fair trial could not be had
by this Defendant in this jurisdiction. Most of you know why this motion
was made. The Defendant was alleged to have been tried and convicted in
the columns of the daily newspaper owned by her father-in-law, Mr. Henry
Kinsolving, and as a result public opinion was said to have been
prejudiced to the extent that it was doubtful twelve Jurors could be
found with open minds. This Court regretfully denied the motion. It did
not believe that a Jury with open minds could not be found. The members
of this Jury declared on oath that their minds were open. The Court had
no reason at that time to disbelieve them.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Elizabeth Kinsolving has been tried and found
guilty of murder of her husband, Lee Kinsolving. Lee Kinsolving was the
only son of our most prominent citizen. Mr. Kinsolving controls, or is
said to control, our leading bank, many of our business enterprises and
our only daily newspaper. He affords employment to a large number of our
citizens. His influence on our affairs is very great. Perhaps to
great.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Your Honor, I protest that
statement!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sit down, Mr. Prosecutor. Your are out of
order.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: We all new Lee Kinsolving well, We watched
him grow up. We observed that he was proud and hot tempered, and had a
strain of arrogance, not unlike others of his family.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: From this town Lee Kinsolving went to fight
for his country. And to this town, before he went overseas, he brought
the wife he had married up North. To us he returned a war hero badly
wounded, condemned for the rest of his life to wear a heavy brace around
his neck. Competent medical testimony has shown that without that brace
a very slight movement might have been enough to snap his spinal cord.
This injury humiliated and embittered Lee Kinsolving, made him morose
and violent, and perhaps caused him to drink to excess. The Defendant
has admitted that there were bitter quarrels between herself and her
husband. Such a quarrel took place on the night of his death, Upon the
manner of that death this entire proceeding rests.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: In my summing up to the Jury I emphasized
that the case for the prosecution was, as so many murder cases are,
purely circumstantial. It was alleged that while Lee Kinsolving slept,
perhaps in a drunken stupor and perhaps not, the Defendant removed the
neck brace from his neck and jerked his head sufficiently to rupture the
spinal cord and cause death. It is admitted that the Defendant was found
holding the neck brace in her hand, and bending over her husband’s body,
which was lying on the bed. Not in the bed, mind you, but sprawled
across it. The Defendant has testified that lee Kinsolving himself
removed the neck brace to torment her, as it were, with the great danger
in which this placed him. Then he started to walk towards her, holding
the brace in his hands, and that being unsteady on his feet, he stumbled
and fell backwards across the bed. And this fall broke his neck,
although at the time she did not know it. She has testified that she
picked the brace up from the floor and was about to attempt to replace
it on his neck when her father-in-law entered the room and found her in
that position. By its verdict the Jury declared that Elizabeth
Kinsolving’s account of the death of her husband to be impossible of
belief.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: In all murder trails, a motion by the Defense
for a directed verdict of acquittal before the case goes to the Jury is
more or less automatic. It is usually perfunctory, and for that reason
immediately denied. The laws of this state, and a few other
jurisdictions, confer upon a Court a right to reserve its ruling upon
such a motion until after the Jury has rendered its verdict. In this
proceeding, I, as presiding Judge, availed myself of this power. I most
honestly hoped that the Jury in this case might act as impartially as it
declared itself to be.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Let me remind you that a Jury is the sole
Judge of fact, and further let me remind you that the Jury must judge
all the facts. It may not select nor create nor change facts. It may
only interpret them. It may not declare something impossible which in
fact is merely extremely difficult to believe. Impossible is a very big
word. If we believe Elizabeth Kinsolving’s sworn testimony, we must also
believe that Lee Kinsolving performed an act which was almost certain to
cause his death. It is difficult… very difficult to believe. But is it
impossible? Are we sure that he knew it would cause his death? Or that
in his then state of mind, he even considered the consequences at all?
Many people have attempted suicide as a result of domestic quarrels. Not
all have succeeded, nor meant to succeed. And surely not all those who
did succeed… fully intended to. Not all knew what they were doing and
those who did know, there were surely a few whose desire to hurt others
overcame their fear of hurting themselves. We cannot know what was in
Lee Kinsolving’s Mind. Therefore, some element of doubt must infallibly
remain. It was not necessary for this Jury to declare its belief in the
Defendant’s innocence, nor to declare its that Lee Kinsolving by
accident or his own intent. It was necessary for the Jury to admit to
themselves, as reasonable men, the possibility…. however slight… that
Elizabeth Kinsolving’s story was true. This possibility the Jury has
refused to admit. It therefore becomes my duty to declare that such a
possibility does in fact exist… and the Jury’s refusal to recognize it
was a failure to exercise it proper function.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The Court therefore rules that the motion of
the Attorney for the Defense for a directed verdict of not guilty be now
granted. The verdict of guilty brought by this Jury is herby set aside,
and a verdict of not guilty is to be entered on the record. And the
Defendant, Elizabeth Kinsolving, is here with discharged from custody of
the Sheriff of this county.</p>
<p><strong>kinsloving</strong>: For four years I endured your presence
in my house, although I well knew you were no fit wife for my son.. That
he had married in haste, and that he would repent it bitterly if he
survived the war. I had no thought that he would die under his own roof,
nor that the reward of my patience would be to stand beside his grave. I
have done my best to avenge him. So far I have failed. But I have not
finished. You are free to go where you will, but there will be another
day of reckoning, somewhere, sometime. And when that day comes, I will
be there. And that time you will not escape.</p>
<p><strong>int. royal hotel - porter’s desk/corridor/main floor
–</strong>: NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Good evening, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: I’m afraid there’s nothing more tonight,
Miss. Unless you charter a plane.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How long would that take?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Well… they have to service the plane… and
get a pilot down to the field, unless there’s one hanging around there
still… and then they have to get the immigration officer…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Immigration Officer?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Crossing the border this time of night
they’re a bit particular. You’d have to prove your identity, you know…
unless you’ve got a passport. They might even want to know why you’re in
such a hurry. Otherwise they might think…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: They might think I was running away from
something.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Possibly, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Leaving us so soon, Miss Mayfield?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t blame you.. For running away.</p>
<p><strong>elevator boy</strong>: Good night, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>elevator boy</strong>: This isn’t the penthouse floor,
Mr. Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Miss Mayfield…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I know it’s a littler late for an
apology.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Much too late.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Don’t take it so big… it isn’t a
tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You said it wasn’t a tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s funny about that? If you pick up
people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas
about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s one less tonight.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Out on the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Through the heart, apparently. Very little
blood. What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There isn’t one.. That anyone would believe.
I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean…alone… I came up and
went to bed. I didn’t sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm.
And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That’s the
first time I saw him out there.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He got in here how?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I
don’t know how he got in. I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Ever see this before?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No. And I’ve never fired a gun in my life,
Aren’t you supposed not to touch it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Sure… but somebody always does..</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Lovely eyes… honest eyes..</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: They’ll know whether he killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How did you meet him?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: On a train. He said he lived here, and he
offered to make a reservation for me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nice of him.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He knew the immigration officer. He eased
himself in.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He was a great boy for that. What else?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s all there is.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: They’re still honest eyes… but there’s
something behind them.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Go ahead…if you want to. It doesn’t
matter.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’d rather wait until it does matter.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You tried to run away.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There wasn’t any plane.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s always a mistake to run away.
Always.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Want a spike in it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You make friends quickly, don’t you,
Clark?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: And without much discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Leave that one lay.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: They still hang women in Canada, I’ve
heard.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: So much less refined than frizzling them
in the chair.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Oh, shut up! You haven’t even got your spats
on.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Think I’ll have trouble staying awake?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I’m sorry. This thing has just knocked me
silly. How long do we have to wait for this police character?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Until he comes. He’s a nice guy. You’ve met
him.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: That comedian?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Don’t let the eyeglass fool you. That’s
what it’s for.</p>
<p><strong>handley</strong>: You Mr. Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>handley</strong>: Inspector Killaine’s compliments. He’ll be
up in another ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: You in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: So it seems Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but
once in a while…for moral purposes…you might address me as “Inspector”.
In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me “sir”.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor
chap.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: They tell me he’ll be a great loss to the
liquor trade. This Mayfield girl…</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: … I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ve met her.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: It’s her room. She only got to the Hotel this
afternoon,. With him. I guess he took too much for granted. Here’s the
gun.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh? No, it’s
a Belgian gun… 6.6 mm.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Correct, Inspector. A woman’s gun. U.S. 125
caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Nobody’s been questioned yet. You noticed the
wound entry?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Much too low for a suicide. Not conclusive, of
course. But a woman of ordinary height, standing rather close to a tall
man, such as he was… …would be apt to shoot him about where he got
shot.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Then there’s the shell.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: This make of gun throws a shell backwards,
high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: So the shell ought to have gone over?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Unless the gun was slanted up.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: So the wound and the shell give you the
same answer.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Right. A clean deduction from observed facts.
They’ve got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ve always looked forward to it. All
right, let’s get him out of here and tidy up.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: I’d take a look in her clothes closet if I
were you, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m sorry to have kept you waiting,
Mrs. West, Mr. Clarendon.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Miss Mayfield. There’s not much I can do
tonight. But there is one thing.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this
before?</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: I’m sorry, Inspector, I don’t know much
about..</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Recently, then.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: No, Not recently. I’m sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Mr. West?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I never saw it before.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Positive?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Yes, I’ve seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: On Miss Mayfield’s balcony.. beside the
chaise, I picked it up. Don’t ask me why. I ought to know better.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Quite sure you had no motive?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I rather thought so. And before that, had
you ever seen the gun?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: It was lying where on the balcony?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Near his right hand. About a foot away.
Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn’t use a tape measure.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: We do, when we get the chance.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I needn’t keep you any longer,
Mr. Clarendon.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: Thank you. It is rather late… and I’m not
young anymore. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Not quiet yet.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn’t you,
Mrs. West?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I was in love with him… which shows you the
quality of my brains. Why don’t you ask her about the gun?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell,
would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low
enough. I’ve felt it myself.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Then why not give Miss Mayfield the
benefit of the doubt?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I’d be delighted to… anytime you can show me
the doubt. I’ll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on
it for her.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Thank you very much, Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How about a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: No thanks. I had some. How would you like
to take a walk for, say, half and hour?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t know her.. or particularly want
to.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You probably know the type. You find them
in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and
money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and
enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those
little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their
incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like
Larry Mitchell. Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I was born in New York City. I grew up. And
here I am.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ll have to know a little more than
that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry, that’s all there is.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation
escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was
murdered. Privately, I’m quite sure of it now. It happened in your room,
and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel
reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved
nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a
threat. A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be
too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a
little suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Please answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You didn’t ask a question. You made a
speech.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That’s an evasion and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: I don’t think you locked your door.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield
left her door unlocked. Or if she didn’t, there’s a passkey on every
floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain
has a passkey. The hotel’s full of passkeys.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Passkey?</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: Or–since one is a well-known and
respected guest–one could go to the desk in the lobby and say “Miss
Mayfield seems to have lost her room key–have you another”? They always
have another.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Don’t be a fool. I loved him. He wasn’t worth
it, but I loved him.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: And now that he’s safe from all other
women, you can go on loving him.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You nasty, sardonic–</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust
nasty. You lied about the gun.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: I’m a very observant man. You had
something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold
it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you
put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw
him again.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: That’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: I saw your face this evening when the
detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: He saw my face too.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: So he did–but he hasn’t told you what he
saw. I have.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: They’ll arrest that girl. Everything points
to her.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: Convenient, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: One of these days, you’re going to wake up in
the middle of the night and find that you’ve cut your throat.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: How clumsy. I’d never forgive myself.
Good night my dear.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You could have got in that room, just as you
got in here. How do I know you didn’t kill Larry?</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: With what motive?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Nastiness. You’re nasty with words. Why
wouldn’t you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him–and I
know why.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: He was very easy to hate. If you’ll look
in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you’ll know why.</p>
<p><strong>clarendon</strong>: Very silly of me, isn’t it? I’m not as
well-off as I was once- and I’m used to my little comforts.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That star up there is Alphard. “The
lonely”, they call him. I wonder why he’s lonely? Perhaps he’s a
policeman–a celestial policeman?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Well, that’s not getting us anywhere. You
won’t tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won’t
even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy
marriage?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Who told you I was married?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: There’s the clear mark of a wedding ring
on your finger.</p>
<p><strong>betty.</strong>: I want a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: The room’s full of cigarettes. But of
course one would have to be handed to you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Stop saying you’re sorry. I want
information, not regrets.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Would you be satisfied if I said I shot
him?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: What this?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Where’s you get it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: A graduation present.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That’s a rather inferior grade humor. But
since you’re being so frank, would you mind telling me why all the
labels have been removed from your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: An unhappy marriage hardly seems a
sufficient reason for that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why don’t you arrest me and be done with
it.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I probably shall–after I’ve tortured you a
little more.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How are you two getting along?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield
says something, I know less than I did before. Well, I may as well knock
off for tonight. Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your
cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s one thing I may as well tell you.
You’ll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away–when I found him out
there on the balcony. There wasn’t any plane.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You didn’t have to tell him that.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Especially as I already knew it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Bad?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bad enough.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He could hardly help suspecting you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s putting it mildly.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Quarter after one. Why?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s a lot of night left to live
through.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: So there is. You don’t want to go to bed. I
don’t want to go to bed. Let’s go somewhere and hear some music–have
something to drink– something to eat–even dance.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dance? Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Let’s not pretend Mitchell meant anything
to either of us.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Certainly not to me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Just who are you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You, too? My name is Betty Mayfield. I was
born, and I am here. Message ends. That’s what I told him. He didn’t
like it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m different. I like it fine.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Nice writing–but no information I didn’t
expect any.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Miss Mayfield would like a little fresh
air. Any objections?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: In case you want to have us followed.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Well–good night.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Cold?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Is this the best you can do?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: At this time of night. It’s not as bad as
it looks.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: Nice to see you, Mr. Brandon–and the lady.
What’ll you take?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Scotch?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Scotch. The kind you buy, Magruder, not the
kind you make.</p>
<p><strong>magdruder</strong>: Only the best for you, Mr. Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>blowsy girl</strong>: What you need is a drink, big boy.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Aw, go blow your nose.</p>
<p><strong>brandon and betty</strong>: She is staring horrified at
this.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why did you bring me to such a place?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: There isn’t anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Want to dance?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dance? Here?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: They know you here–know your name.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I know everybody. I don’t look at half of
life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All right, then, let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That man over there. He was in the hotel
lobby.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I didn’t notice him.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We walked right passed him. He’s following
us.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Killaine’s not that sort of guy. He said
no–he meant no.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Then he’s got to be a detective.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Then he’s–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Take me out of here, please. Right away. If
you don’t I’ll go alone.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Quite sure you saw him in the hotel
lobby?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Absolutely sure.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: We’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You go out and get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: The light’s bad in here, but I seem to
remember the face. What was the name?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: All right, let’s see the buzzer.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s a buzzer?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: So you’re not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Me a cop? What made you think that,
Mr. Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who told you my name?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ve got good ears.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How are your teeth getting along?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave
me all kinds of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s this in favor of?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t like to be tailed. The lady I’m
with doesn’t like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of
nutshells, I don’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You wanna get tough, Mr. Brandon, you gotta
know the technique. Next time, turn a little sideways, get your hip in
the way. See what I mean? Good night.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He’s a fellow with a very hard knee, and he
knows how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You don’t know who he is?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He’s not a cop. A cop wouldn’t have kneed
me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He was following us–but he’s not a
policeman.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Us?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All right–following me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No matter. There’s nothing I can do about
it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Anything I can do about it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Take me home–and forget you ever saw me.
That’s a silly remark isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Try not talking.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It still doesn’t matter if I kiss you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Nothing matters.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No use waiting, then.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s the second round I’ve lost tonight.
That fellow hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: So have I.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: From you, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Good morning. Can I do something for
you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as
a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bank?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It’s
usual for the guests who come here for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m carrying quite a large sum in Travelers
checks. How much of a deposit would you like?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I wouldn’t dream if questioning your
credit. Purely a matter of routine, for the hotel records. Just the name
of your bank–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The Hotel records, Mr. Campbell?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I’m afraid I’ve been clumsy. Please
overlook it, Miss Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I’m sorry I can’t
give you the name of my bank–because I have no bank at the moment. That
was a crude trick.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: They’re all crude, when they don’t work.
Had breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful
morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Deep blue? I’d call it grey-blue.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You must come from pretty far South.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: FLorida?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ve never been to Florida.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Morning. Any calls?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Reed would like you to call him.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: All right. Get him.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: And there’s a Mr. Goble to see you. Says
his business is personal.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who’s Goble?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m Goble.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: I’d like a few words with you, in
private.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m not interested in blind dates.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Reed, please, for Mr. Brandon. Very
well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now. Mr. Reed stepped
out, Mr. Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: All right. Talk it up.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: “Martin Goble. Insurance Adjuster.”</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nice friendly approach you’ve got. Goble. I
could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: You asked for it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m still asking. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: I’m not sure I want anything from you. You
might want something from me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Name it.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Information–protection–you might even want to
hire me to go home and listen to the radio. That’s the funny part of my
business– once in a while, I get hired not to work. Nice girl you were
with last night. Known her long?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Private eye?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: You guessed it. The card’s phony. I got
plenty of ’em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San
Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What are your rates?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty
high on a case like this. I’m a long way from home. I don’t have a B.C.
Licence. I’d need about $500 for a retainer.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What have you got on Miss Mayfield?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last
night. You haven’t hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s a nice hard knee you’ve got, Goble.
How’d you like to trade it for a broken neck?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I’m
neurotic.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know whether to knock your teeth
down your throat–or call the police–or just give you twenty bucks to go
out and buy yourself a clean nose.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the
price to be a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: If I call the police, your price will go
down to a minus sign.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Bluff. You’ve waited too long.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: For five hundred, what do I get?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: I go home and paint the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: For two hundred?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: I stick around and wait for the five
hundred.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You mentioned information.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can
hire me not to use it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: A thousand.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Got it on you?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Got the information on you?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Get it in half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: There’s two hundred. I’ll meet you in an
hour–where we met last night</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Why not here?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t like your perfume in my office.
Make it somewhere else if you don’t like Charlie’s.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Charlie’s suits me fine. I don’t scare.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: You pay the check, you pick the joint. See
you.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Down below’s Stanley Park. On the other
side of the trees, there’s a beach. You can see it. Steveston’s over
there. Coast Guard station. There’s the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the
docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there’s Grouse Mountain.
It’s about 4000 feet high. There’s a restaurant on top of it. Very nice
restaurant. I’m sorry we couldn’t have met in pleasanter circumstances,
Miss Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We wouldn’t have met at all.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: True. I was a bit irritable last night. I
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You were a galahad, compared to some cops
I’ve known.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You’ve had dealings with the police
before?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Who hasn’t–one way or another?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: But not in the investigation of a major
crime, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Is it a crime?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: We’re 98 per cent certain Mitchell was
murdered. There are a lot of reasons. Was he very drunk when you last
saw him?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You were there when I last saw him.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’d like to believe that. It’s not too
easy.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ve been talking to the Immigration
Inspector who passed you across the border. He was a little suspicious
of you. Mayfield isn’t really your name, is it?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ll find out, you know. Perhaps not
today–perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The police always do, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You’ve has an experience that you don’t
want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I wouldn’t make you talk about it. My job
is the death of Marry Mitchell. Why can’t you give me your
confidence?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You–or the Vancouver Police Department?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: We try to be decent.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re a police officer. A very nice one–but
you have a job to do. I’m a girl who’s in a jam, and it’s your job to
keep me there. Don’t go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You won’t tell me who you are? You won’t
even give me a chance to help you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Nobody can help me. You, least of all.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: If I understand what you meant by
that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You understand perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Then there isn’t much I can do, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There isn’t anything you can do.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: I came here to see Mr. Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>man with mop</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Brandon. I was to meet him here.</p>
<p><strong>man with mop</strong>: Okay. Ask the boss.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: I’m looking for Mr. Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: The joint’s not open, Mac. Who’s
Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: I have an appointment with him, right here,
right now.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: Go live in a tent.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: It’ll be a tough dollar when guys like you
learn the alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: Talk English. How do I know you’re
you?</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: Mr. Brandon couldn’t be here. He might
have left something for you. What would it look like?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: One of those nice long manila
envelopes–sealed. Not too fat- not too thin.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: What do I get for it?</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: You get it’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: Sounds like a fair swap. Let’s take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: I need a receipt. Sign your name across
the flap.</p>
<p><strong>goble</strong>: Open it and count it.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: When you sign for it, you count it. It’s
your dough.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: Eight hundred bucks. Ice cream for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: You had it coming, didn’t you, baby? Come
on. You’re not that sick.</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: Don’t tell me you had a glass head, baby.
Oh no–not in your business. How could you live so long?</p>
<p><strong>int. vancouver police headquarters - killaine’s office

<p><strong>gore</strong>: Sit down, Mrs. West. Inspector Killaine will
be along in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Killaine here. I want a radio contact to
work with Handley. A motorcycle officer will do.</p>
<p><strong>voice from dictagraph</strong>: Right away, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Remember that time, didn’t I? Good morning
Mrs. West. Does your visit here mean you’ve changed your mind?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: How did you know? Clarendon. You cops never
tell anybody anything, do you.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Other people always know so much more than
we know–so much more than they’re willing to tell us.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: It was Clarendon. He knew I had the gun in my
bag.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You couldn’t possible have traced it this
soon–not possibly.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Of course not. Thanks for telling me. I
haven’t seen Mr. Clarendon.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I am a fool.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That depends upon your motive. You were in
love with Mitchell, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Yes–and he’s already becoming vague to me.
Funny! Last night I was furiously jealous. Jealous of what? I out that
gun in my bag deliberately. Who was I going to kill with it? A girl I
didn’t even know? A man I knew to be a thief and a forger? A half-man? A
gigolo? It’s already ludicrous. Love! What a comedy!</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You didn’t play it for laughs last
night.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Did you ever have a serious operation?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Mortar shells are not funny, either.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: At first, it doesn’t hurt at all. That’s
shock. Then it hurts terribly–you wouldn’t believe such pain could
exist–and six months later you can’t remember what pain felt like. It
hasn’t taken six months this time. It hasn’t even taken twenty- four
hours. Is that a beastly thing to say?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Not if it clears the air.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: It does. May I go now?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ll investigate Mr. Clarendon’s financial
position–</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all
his problems.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Now, you’re being beastly.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Sure. You didn’t come here in person just
to tell me about the gun. You wanted me to be looking across the desk at
you while you talked about Mitchell. If I believe you, it would be
psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: And if you didn’t believe me?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You would still have planted information
that Clarendon knew about the gun–and not as an accusation, but in the
process of defending yourself by making a confession. Very neat. Good
morning, Mrs. West.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Killaine here.</p>
<p><strong>supt. mckechnie’s voice</strong>: Come into my office,
please, Killaine.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Right away, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. vancouver police headquarters - mckechnie’s office
–</strong>: DAY</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.
Young Mitchell’s father. He just flew in from Toronto.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: How do you do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: I’ve explained the situation to
Mr. Mitchell up to a point. Now about this Mayfield girl?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: She’s a suspect, naturally. But not the
only one.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: She’s the only one who had a dead man in
her room. The only one who won’t give an account of herself. The only
one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I’ve been told, who
went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the
labels from her clothes. What more do you want?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell, sr.</strong>: She should have been arrested last
night.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: That’s as may be. We’ve ample grounds to
detain her for questioning. You can’t deny that, surely.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: I hear she’s a very pretty girl.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Which forces me to arrest her against my
better judgment.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: Aye. You have a point there.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell, sr.</strong>: If so, I must say that it escapes my
attention. It is my son who has been murdered. He was not always a good
son–but he was my son. I want his murderer punished. The girl’s
obviously a criminal of some sort. Otherwise, she’d give an account of
herself. Arrest her, and you’ll find out soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: I think he’s right.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Am I to interpret that as an order to
arrest Miss Mayfield?</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: When I give an order, you’ll not need it
interpreted. You have an hour to make your mind up. Well, are ye
satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell, sr.</strong>: I’ll be satisfied when my son’s
murderer is convicted and hanged. You’ve given this young man a very
difficult choice.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: Aye. That was the point you said you
didn’t get. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: May I have a moment, Inspector?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: The Harbor police have just picked up a
dead man out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Floater?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Not a floater. Only just dead.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You’re the waterfront specialist. Find out
about it. I’ve got a murder to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: You have two murders to investigate. This
man’s head was beaten in. And there’s nothing in his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Drunk-rolling job. They hit him too
hard.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: I’ve been on the waterfront detail for
twelve years. This man hadn’t been dead an hour. He wasn’t killed last
night. He was killed today. In broad daylight. That’s no drunk- rolling
job.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Let me know when you’ve identified him</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: And don’t get too logical, Driscoll. In
police business it doesn’t work. I wish it did. But it doesn’t</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: I’m an Irishman, sir. An Irishman is
always logical.</p>

<p><strong>voice of command</strong>: Right TURN!</p>
<p><strong>a sound of feet, a stamp, a slapping of hands against
rifle</strong>: SLINGS as guard brings its arms to order. Betty turns
her head to look at Killaine.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I expected nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I might be able to save you. If I knew
enough.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You wouldn’t even try There must be some
copper in you, or you wouldn’t be an inspector.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: There must be– but when I’m with you I
can’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>voice of command</strong>: Guard, Present ARMS!</p>
<p><strong>appropriate sounds are heard, then a roll starts on
the</strong>: TAP DRUMS.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Everybody loves a guard mount– except the
guard. My boss gave me an hour to make up my mind. The time’s almost
up.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m about to be very silly. A man passes a
girl on the street–a very lovely girl–his eyes meet her eyes, and
something reaches out and takes hold of his heart– and then she goes on
and is lost in the crowd–and he says to himself, “There goes my lost
love”– and it’s true–if he never sees her again, it’s still true. Of
course, after a while, he forgets– or almost forgets–because after a
while we forget almost everything. But this man is a copper. He gets
orders–routine orders–to go to a place and investigate a murder– and
everything points to a certain girl.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Points very straight to her.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: He looks at the girl, looks into her
eyes–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What does he see?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Palm trees against a sunset–waves breaking
on a coral reef–the Taj Mahal by moonlight–roses in an English garden,
just after a shower– Clich�s, one and all–but good ones, with a lot of
mileage left in them–there’s one thing he does not see–murder–and murder
was what he was sent to find. Pretty ridiculous, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Very ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That’s my hard luck–I’m man enough to tell
you about it–and not be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What do your friends call you?– The ones that
know you well?–and like you very much?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: They call me Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over
with?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Not quiet yet. We know who the gun
belonged to. Margo West. She told us this morning. It doesn’t mean much.
Mitchell took it away from her. He had a habit of going through her
bag.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Looking for peanuts, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards,
Brandon picked it up. There’s no indication you handled it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I always wear gloves when I shoot people. A
bad joke–but better than tears.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Time’s up. I’m off the case.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: They’ll only find someone else– who won’t be
so kind.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That’s something I can’t spare you. But I
won’t do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Because you think your in love with me?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m enough of a copper to do my duty. My
boss made it tough for me. If I don’t arrest you, I’ve gone soft. If I
do, it’s to save my face. I don’t play those rules.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You’ve got a couple of hours, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I can’t answer that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What will they do to you?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That’s they’re business. Can I drop you
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re still a police officer, Jeff. I saw
you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What are you going to do–toss your job into
Puget Sound? Because I make you think of magnolias? I thought policeman
was something like a soldier. That his duty came first. However much he
might happen hate it.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ve been a soldier too. There is a
difference. A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself
on proper grounds.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What proper grounds? You can’t be in love
with me. You hardly know me. I’m not in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But even if you were in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: There’s an empty taxi across the street.
If you’re so anxious, take it. He’ll know the way to the police
headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You do things the hard way, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not sometimes. Always. Just because it is the
hard way. You’re that kind of man, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Goodbye, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Where to, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Downtown somewhere–anywhere.</p>

nincompoop?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: A little of both, sir, and perhaps not
quiet enough of either.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: It won’t look pretty good on your record,
Killaine. Where’s the girl now?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: Well, find out. Who’s covering her?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Nobody’s covering her, I detached the
officer assigned to that duty.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: This girl is a murderess, Killaine.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I disagree, sir. As Inspector in charge of
the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on
it.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: Ye have, have ye?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: We lifted seven fairly good prints from
Miss Mayfield’s toilet articles. Washington ought to teletype us within
a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: And in the meantime this girl goes where
she pleases, does what she pleases?</p>

<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: You’re a young man. You’re romantic. You

<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Not too far, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>mckechnie</strong>: This badge is not an old newspaper you
can cast down on the desk. It is not a thing you can give up as of no
value. It may be taken from you–and you may die defending it. But you’ll
not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with. It’s a naked steel of
the sword of Justice. Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to
it–and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.</p>

Plume. Jess Holmes, the fool killer. Boy, you look wonderful in a
tank–with the turret closed.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Got a moment, Inspector?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ve got a year. Or a second. I’m not sure
which.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: You told me when we’d identified this
fellow–</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: We’ve done that. He’s a San Francisco
private eye. Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E. Had initials in his hat
and for once he lived where he bought it. Goble and Greer is the firm
name.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Swimming with his hat on? That’s
original.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: If you’d seen the blood on his head–and
some body had to carry him out to sea–</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I understand. Pity to mess up a nice clean
boat.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: I got through to Greer, his partner in the
detective business. Greer won’t give out.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’d suggest a telegram. Something like
this: Chief of Police, San Francisco. A licensed private detective named
named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within
our jurisdiction. His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses
to give us any information. Correction. Refuses information necessary to
our investigation. Can you assist? Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll,
Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Send that?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Would you?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: If you’re asking my opinion, no. I’d read
it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it’s
important.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: How important would it have to be? It’s
only murder, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: The Super’s just given me the sweetest
dressing down I’ve ever had. I’m still reeling from it. And believe me,
I had it coming. I apologize. What you think is important–I think is
important.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders
about this wire to San Francisco?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Men like you don’t need orders.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Time for a little chat?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: If it doesn’t take too long. Drink?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Thanks. I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Thanks. Lovely view you have, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I never notice the view after the first
week.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I would. Fancy waking up every morning
with that in your lap. Wonderful thing, money is. Remember what Somerset
Maugham said about it ?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: “Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives
meaning to all the others.” Very appealing, especially to a poor
man.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Could we discuss that some other time?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Sure. Let’s discuss Betty Mayfield. How
long since you saw her?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: A couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I have a warrant for her arrest.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That must hurt.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ve always thought you were a pretty nice
guy, Brandon. I’d like to go on thinking so. If you tried to help her
get away–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Would that make me a heel?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You’d be breaking the law.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Doesn’t answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: The only answer I have for you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You passed up a dozen chances to arrest
her. What toughened you up?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Information.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Don’t kid me. You don’t think she murdered
Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: It could have been an accident.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That COULD BE TOLD.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Not if she knew she wouldn’t be
believed.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Your concentrating too hard, Killaine. What
about Margo West? She had a motive. I guess you know by this time whose
gun it was?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: And old man Clarendon? He had a motive,
too. Margo and her money.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Mitchell was killed down here. How could
Clarendon get in to do it? Or Margo for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How could Mitchell? After that act he put
on up here, is it likely she’d let him in?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: She didn’t have to. He could have climbed
down from here.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mitchell was too drunk.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Or just drunk enough. He was with her when
she registered. He knew where her room was. You were out most of the
evening. There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going,
the door standing open. Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for
himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty’s
balcony was just below yours.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale,
Killaine.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You don’t buy it. Okay. So I still want
Betty Mayfield. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No idea.</p>

you enough trouble. I– I think I know what to do–if they’ll let me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It sounds like a fair location. Could you
be a little more exact?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m in the Hudson Bay Company’s store. That
man last night–the one that followed me–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t think that’s on the market anymore.
I’d like something much closer to the water.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Cant be too close for me. Right across the
street from it suits me. Anything else listed?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s another man–right outside the booth
here. I never saw him Before.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re probably mistaken about that. Let’s
get together sand talk it over. There’s always a solution to these
problems. But it must be near the water. Quite near– Yes, if you don’t
mind waiting.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Close to the water. Like last night. I’ll
try. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry I kept you waiting.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t give it a thought, Miss. Matter of fact,
waiting is my trade.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Pardon me, Madam. Is that your
handkerchief?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: No more for me, thanks. Remember what I
said. I can’t interfere with the law.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Where would she go, anyway. Don’t tell me
you haven’t got her covered.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mitchell was a heel. We both know that. Why
take it for granted that somebody in the hotel knocked him off?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You forgetting the gag line, Killaine. The
police don’t take anything for granted.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m afraid they do. Far too often. So
long.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You do a lot of real estate trading,
Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of
it.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I tried it once. I lost my shirt.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I buy my shirts by the dozen.
Fortunately.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Where did it all come from? Or is that a
permissible question?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I had a father who knew how to steal.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You asked me where it all came from.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Oh. That was just one of those idle
questions. One doesn’t expect an answer.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I think I’d like to take another look at
Mr. Mitchell’s room.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I don’t know why. As a matter of fact, I
don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: It’s about time you did–know
something.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I agree with you perfectly. But when did
time ever help a fool?</p>
<p><strong>handley</strong>: Nothing. She hasn’t shown.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Check the boat?</p>
<p><strong>handley</strong>: Gore’s out doing it now.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Must be almost tea-time I’ll be in
Mitchell’s room.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hop in.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I hated to go to that place. I almost went to
the police station instead.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No percentage in that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: They’re going to arrest me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I know. Killaine has a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I have my own warrant. Stop a minute,
please.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: “Dear Inspector Killaine: This is goodbye.
You were right, I had a secret. You were right, I changed my name. I
tried to hide from the past and I walked into almost the same situation
that I had run away from. I didn’t kill Larry Mitchell, but I can’t
prove it. I couldn’t prove it the other time, either. Where I am going,
nothing has to be proved. There’s a lot of water between Vancouver and
the U.S.A. In that, and in you. Vancouver has been kind to me. I think
you will understand. Betty Mayfield.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: If you meant it, you wouldn’t show it to
me, Betty. Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector
Killaine?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson
Bay Store. With somebody’s Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.
Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps I didn’t mean it. All I know is that I’m
licked.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: There’s a lot of water between Vancouver
and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note. After you’re gone where
would they look for you? Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open
water, and a fast cabin cruiser. And I have a pocket full of money. And
if I helped you, I’d be committing a crime, or so they tell me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That wasn’t why I called you. Why did I
hope–when I hadn’t any right to hope?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How bad is it? Bad enough for–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes. I’ve never been very far from it, for a
long time. Will you do something for me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Take me where I haven’t the courage to take
myself.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How bad is the other thing? The secret?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I was tried for murdering my husband. Guilty.
The judge set the verdict aside. There was one man on the jury– –but he
was afraid. They were all afraid–of my father-in-law. That man followed
me last night– he came from him of course. My father-in-law will never
give up. Never. He promised me that. So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far
away as I can get from North Carolina. And it happens all over again.
Almost the same thing. Almost the same way. Do you wonder about
this–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This is the ace, Betty. But not of spades.
They’ll find out about the other. They might know already. And when they
get this– What would they look for? Where? Out there somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: They’ll look for you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I run over to Victoria. Play some golf with
some people I know. Do it all the time. That’s why I have a cabin
cruiser. Custom- built.Forty knots. Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman
of almost complete leisure. Member of six golf clubs. Broke 70 once on
the Shaughnessy Heights Course. You have to be good to do that, And if
you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a
few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon’s boat, the Valkyrie.
Came alone? Sure. He always comes alone. Mr Brandon’s a rather lonely
man.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And Betty Mayfield–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Blonde, beautiful, and sad–and nowhere. Of
course she might have run away–if she knew how. And where to go. She
might have dyed her hair. Bleached it before probably. And changed her
name again. But look at this note. And look at her room in the hotel.
Her stuff is all there. Hasn’t a rag except what she stood up in. You
don’t run away like that. Not if you are young and beautiful. No
chance.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But that’s what I’m doing. Couldn’t they
think of that?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: If they had any reason to. Why make it
tough for themselves? Why go to all that trouble? Here’s an open book.
Close it. No reason to keep it open. She was a nice girl, anyway. And
perhaps she didn’t kill him on purpose. Perhaps she didn’t kill the
other one. You never know. Give her the benefit of the doubt. Leave her
stay where she is. Close the book. Finis.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Killaine…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: The best interference runner we’ve got. He
thinks he’s in love with you–and he’s a gentleman. Come here, baby.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m not. Or I wouldn’t be doing this right
now. Even if I didn’t like you, I’d have to do it. Like the guy that was
dealt thirteen spades in a bridge hand. Or filled an ace- high flush.
You couldn’t get him out of that game to give him the Pulitzer
Prize.</p>

raid him before he opens, so he won’t lose any business.</p>
<p><strong>sight in the opposite direction, then pans back to pick
up</strong>: THE POLICE CAR IN FRONT OF MAGRUDER’S.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: I want a man from the I-Bureau down here
as soon as possible. There’s some stuff in the waste basket I’m afraid
to handle.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: What always throws me about people like
you is that you’re so stupid. Don’t you know these things have numbers
on them? And that they have to be registered if they’re owned legally?
And that if we find a man dead with his pocket’s empty–and identify him
and find out he’s a private detective from San Francisco–</p>
<p><strong>magruder</strong>: It needs music.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: All we have to do is call the San
Francisco Police and get numbers for his guns. For the love of the
Saints, Magruder, if you’re going into the murder business, why don’t
you learn a few rules? You must have been pretty desperate to move him
out of here in broad daylight.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Don’t you know we have people down in the
district working for us? They might look like tramps to you, and some of
them are. But they have eyes.</p>
<p><strong>magdruder</strong>: The guy pulled a gun on me. I thought it
was a stick-up. I hit him with a sap. Why wouldn’t I? Maybe I hit him
too hard, and it scared me. I wanted to get him away from here. A guy
like me don’t always get believed by guys like you.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: You had over sixteen hundred dollars in
your pocket, a thousand of them in twenty-dollar bills. With a kind of
new look about them at that. Would you be interested in what I think
about this, Magruder?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Hold him. He’s trying to sag on us.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: This man Goble rented the car, gave a
false name. He had no licence, no identification. But he put up a
sufficient deposit. He was a suspicious man. He was on a dubious errand.
He had a gun in his pocket and I’m thinking one of these manila
envelopes– Contained those sheets of blank paper which he was going to
sell for money. And get out before anybody looked at what he’d sold. You
had the money, Magruder. But you didn’t give it to him. You killed him
instead.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Perhaps you didn’t mean to kill him. But
here he was dead, and his car was outside in the street. So you brought
it around to the alley and you carried the man down to it, and you drove
him away. And what happened to him after that, nobody knows until he was
picked out of the water of the Sound, dead. But not long dead. Where did
you leave the car, Magruder? Who helped you? What boat did you have? All
right. Take him in. Set him down. Give him what he wants to make him
comfortable. And get a stenographer. And warn him. And don’t rough him.
He’s a nice little man. All he wants is to collect his thoughts. And
then he’ll tell us the whole story in his own words. Won’t you,
Magruder, darling?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: He’ll be giving the priest a bad time,
this one. Maybe You’d better call an ambulance. He might have a wonky
ticker.</p>

<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’ll be safe here. I won’t be long. Help
yourself to anything you want. The galley’s through there. You can make
coffee if you like.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This must have cost a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It did, but it never paid off– until now. I
ought to be back within an hour. We can’t leave until near dark
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you have to leave the note?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s the frame on the picture. But not if
you say so.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’d still go through–even if I ended up in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You wouldn’t like it. I’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: My father died in jail, and he was twice
the man I am.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You leave it.</p>

this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: She didn’t seem the type to lam out–even if
she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night. Anything
special you’re looking for, Inspector?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ll know when I find it.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: I guess I’m just ballast around here.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: You get those from rich women–if you are the
kind of guy Mitchell was.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: “G.G. Market one-eight-four-two.”</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Gigi, huh? Sounds French–one of those fancy
ladies. Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in
gold.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Market… It seems to me that’s a San
Francisco exchange.</p>
<p><strong>close on the packet of travelers checks to show the</strong>:
DENOMINATIONS OF $500 EACH AND THAT THE PACKET IS QUITE A THICK WAD</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Killaine’s wise. We can’t wait any longer.
Here, put this on. But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor. I’ll
tell you when.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Killaine’s wise to what?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I’m getting a little tired of this,
Sergeant. Mr. Brandon’s a valued guest in this hotel. We’ve known him
for a long time. I don’t like this prowling into people’s rooms.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: How many people in your hotel know a man was
murdered here, Mr.Campbell? Apart from you and the people
questioned?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: None, as far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: And you don’t like our methods, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: That’s all. Thanks, Mr. Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I insist–</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: That’s all. Thanks, Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m coming up.</p>
<p><strong>angle up showing killaine dangling by one hand from
terrace</strong>: ABOVE</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>reverse shot angle down looking down from the terrace
to</strong>: THE VIEW BELOW</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: That’s pretty risky business, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Somebody did it twice last night– in the
dark.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Once to put that in the position where it
is now. And the second time to move it where we found it.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Not too hard, is it?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Maybe we’ve been pretty dumb–</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: There wasn’t any motive…let’s try out the
act.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I have a gun. It’s not loaded. Pretend it
is. I’m drunk. I took the gun away from Margo West. Now I’ve said
something to you that you don’t like. I don’t like the look in your
eyes, either. I’ve pulled the gun. Take it away from me. And while
you’re taking it away from me, it goes off. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Was that about the right angle?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Where’s the shell?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Should be over there.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Pick it up. Put it in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: The same with the gun.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You’ve got a dead man on your hands. You
killed jim–even if it wasn’t murder. What are you going to do about
it?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: If I’ve got any sense I’m going to call
headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: They’ll probably believe you. But they’ll
want to know what you were fighting about. Why Mitchell had a gun.
You’ll tell them a simple story. They’ll pretend it sounds all right to
them. Now you’re headquarters. How does it sound to you?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Before I took the story and closed the case,
I’d want to know a lot more about these people. I’d want to know just
about everything about them.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Exactly. Now I’m the killer. And there’s
something I don’t want you to know. Something that would destroy my
comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Assume there is something to hid. I go to
a lot of trouble. What do I do? What would you do?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Do I know who lives down there?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You can find out.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Do I know that she’s out of the room? Likely
to be out of it for some time?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You can find out the first part. The
second part you have to take a chance on.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Pretty big chance, huh?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: You’ve got a dead man on your hands. Like
this.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Right–</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Let go.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Next?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: This is the shell. What about the gun?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Well. What about it?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: I’ve handled it. Mitchell’s handed it. If I
wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide. If I
leave it here….no suicide.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: I’ve got to find a way to handle it, openly.
Like Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: How did he know he’d get the chance? He
couldn’t have arranged it.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: He could have tried. If he was up there in
the dark, listening, he’d know when she came home, know when she found
Mitchell dead, know what she did about it. If she telephoned, he’d
probably hear that.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: And she did give him the chance, the way it
worked out.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: If she didn’t–if luck was against him–he
wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there–drops it on the chaise.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: No suicide.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Did we ever really think it was
suicide?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: You win, Inspector. You win all along the
line. Why didn’t we think of Brandon before–or did we– some of us. Yeah.
Of course you did. When a suspect thinks he’s safe, you go on letting
him think he’s safe. Wait for a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: And a motive–which we haven’t got. So this
could all be a dream.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Market one-eight-four-two.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San
Francisco. Just like you thought…Two murders in two days. Different
places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but
a telephone number.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: A think wire—but very, very strong. Let’s
get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: See anything?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I can still see the shoreline. The moon is
rising.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: There would be a moon tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Cold?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Frozen.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Go down into the cabin and get yourself a
drink. Careful how you go, we’re hitting the swell now.</p>
<p><strong>close on the inside of the jacket pocket and the
exposed</strong>: CORNER OF THE ENVELOPE. BETTY’S HAND ENTERS THE
SHOT</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I decided I didn’t want a drink…I’m beginning
to wonder.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Wonder what?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you’re doing all this just for me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That, and the fun of it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I thought you had to be back to the hotel. To
leave my–my note.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: See anything up there?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Funny, I never thought of you that way. You
were so close too. We were all pretty stupid about you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Including Killaine.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Including Killaine…I still can’t think of you
that way.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I told you my father died in jail. He stole
a fortune. Most of it pretty dirty money. I don’t care to have that
known.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Larry Mitchell found out. So you killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: In a way.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If it was an accident, you could have told
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: So could you. But our records were a little
against us.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What your father did doesn’t condemn you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nobody believed I wasn’t in on it. I was
just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father. I thought it was a
legitimate business. He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.
I never saw the pies. They had names. For the record. Innocent names.
You know where that kind of money comes from, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.
Let’s you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal. Lets you
own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please. You big,
open-handed, generous guy. That’s the kind of money it takes, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It buys things, just like any other
kind.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That man that was following us last night–he
didn’t come back this morning. I’m beginning to wonder about him, too.
Was he really following me–or you?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No. I paid him off.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He’ll come back…They always come back when
you give them money.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Not this one. And not Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You-killed-him?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Magruder obliged me. No use my saying it
wasn’t planned that way. I had to clean up. I’m not a dumb- smart
college boy anymore. Nobody in the world would believe I didn’t plan the
whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I guess I’m a little screwy. Maybe I could
believe it. Should I try?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Don’t go soft on me, baby. I’ve got your
note in my pocket. You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use
it. It has to be found in exactly the right place.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: So that I will never be found.</p>
<p><strong>int. police headquarters - i-bureau - projection room
–</strong>: NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Got anything on the Goble case yet?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Yes, I think so. Here are two glazed
manila envelopes. One is the bag type. The other one had the money in
it. Don’t ask me how I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’m interested in who handled it.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Four different people, Inspector. Three
men and a women. I’ve made slides for two. They handled both
envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Goble. Second finger on left hand. On
the left, the morgue print. On the right, print lifted from the
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: No doubt about that one.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: How about Magruder?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: He checks too.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: That leaves two strangers.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Try Betty Mayfield. The Mitchell case.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Mayfield? She fit into this?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: She might.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: You’ll have to take my word for it. We
don’t make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I’ll take your word.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Not a chance. Whorl and plain arch.
Different as salt and sand.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Try this one for the second stranger.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Gun permit, huh? Another Whorl–man
size.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: This gun permit was issued to Clark
Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: The card says so, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Brandon handled the money envelope.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: What’s the face for, Driscoll?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Magruder’s conked out. Adrenaline
injections, oxygen tent. He may come out of it and he may not. As a
source of quick information, we can’t forget him.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: We don’t need him.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Go on in. See what they’ve got. All I need
now is a warrant and a pair of wings.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Inspector Killaine. Vancouver City Police.
Commander Goodwin’s expecting me.</p>
<p><strong>senty</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>radio operator</strong>: C.G.L. at all cutters and patrol
planes on station. Vancouver Police Department bulletin. Wanted for
murder. Clarke Brandon. A naturalized Canadian citizen. Age 34-35.
Height six feet, one inch. Weight 190 pounds. Muscular build. Dark hair.
American accent. Now probably at sea in cabin cruiser Valkyrie. Will
probably attempt to cross International line under cover of
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Get down in the cabin, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why? To love ten minutes longer? And in the
meantime, protect you? Why don’t you shoot me now and get it over
with–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you think you have the time.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Always some fog out here.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: There better be.</p>
<p><strong>shot through the plexiglas head and shoulders of the

<p><strong>betty</strong>: You hoped I’d jumped overboard, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But I wouldn’t make it that easy for you.</p>
<p><strong>talker</strong>: Bearing one-three-five. Bearing
one-three-five, sir.</p>
<p><strong>coast guard officer</strong>: Get it?</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: One-three-five, sir.</p>
<p><strong>coast guard officer</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>what they see - long shot across open empty water - a
flare</strong>: HANGING IN THE SKY AND FALLING</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Fog!</p>
<p><strong>coast guard officer</strong>: We got a lot of it out
here.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: Brandon will have counted on that.</p>
<p><strong>coast guard officer</strong>: No doubt. We have something he
may not have counted on.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’ll never make it. You’ve out- smarted
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw
you get on board, nobody seen you since.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You didn’t leave the note.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It wasn’t the time or place. Don’t worry
about the note, baby. I’m playing for my neck now.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And I’m begging for my life–and yours.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mine?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes. Yours. You haven’t murdered anybody. You
killed Mitchell. Wasn’t that an accident? It must have been. If you kill
a blackmailer, you kill him dead–so that he can’t talk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mitchell was dead enough.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And that nasty man that followed us last
night. You didn’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who’d believe it but you? I took him out to
sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him
with me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Magruder does.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You think Magruder wants to hang beside
me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But the next one is murder. First the little
step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.
You could tell about Mitchell. You could tell about Magruder–and the
detective. It would hurt, but you could do it. You could never tell
about me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Would I want to?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Every day of your life you’ll want me. You’ll
never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Shut up! Cut it out! Even if I have to kill
both of us–</p>
<p><strong>coast guard officer</strong>: Nothing yet?</p>
<p><strong>talker</strong>: Just a minute, sir. I believe–</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Change course about five degrees south</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Your dead on now. Hold it there.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Radar.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This is it, Betty. They’ll find us again,
fog or no fog.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If it has to be–do you mind if I do it
myself? Oh, I don’t mean with the gun. This is no trick. When I wrote
that note you have in your pocket– that was no trick either. It’s not so
hard for me as you think. I’m not crying about it, I’ve been skating
close to it for quite some time. The water is cold down there– But so is
everything else. And there’s you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes. You. You’re not really a murderer
yet.</p>
<p><strong>talker</strong>: Bearing one-eight-one. One-eight-one, sir.
Changed course due South.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: One-eight-one..</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: One-eight-one, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m not a murderer yet, you said. Come
here. Come closer. Let me look at you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I think you mean that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you think I was faking?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: If I did-I don’t-now.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: The kiss of death. With a new twist.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: “Dear Inspector Killaine. This is goodbye.
You were right. I had a secret.”</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: A secret, Betty—as who hasn’t</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Stand up! Let them take a good look at you.
Be sure they see you. That fellow back there has night glasses. Then
jump—well out to the side. Just as far as you can.</p>
<p><strong>following shot as betty hits the water and the
cruiser</strong>: PULLS AWAY RAPIDLY</p>
<p><strong>coast guard officer</strong>: Full speed astern.</p>
<p><strong>talker</strong>: Full speed astern.</p>
<p><strong>coast guard officer</strong>: Better get those wet clothes
off in a hurry, Miss. My cabin’s at your disposal.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He could have killed me a dozen times. You’d
never have known.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: We know everything.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, Jeff. You don’t. He’s not a murderer, I
tell you. He;s not a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I hope he can prove it. Come on. You don’t
want to get pneumonia.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But I tell you—if you’d only understand.</p>
<p><strong>killaine</strong>: I understand, Betty. I understand
perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>first passenger</strong>: You always have this kind of
weather up here?</p>
<p><strong>second passenger</strong>: Certain times of the year. Always
a lot of fog. But they never hit anything, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: An old packing case, I guess.</p>
