<p><strong>troy</strong>: Are we shooting people, or what?</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: Are we shooting?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: That’s what I’m asking you.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: What’s the answer?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t know the answer. That’s what I’m
trying to find out.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #3</strong>: It looks like a grain of sand, but I
don’t know how I’m gonna get it out–</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: If they surrender, don’t shoot,
if they don’t surrender, then shoot.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #3</strong>: That guy just shot a towel head.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #4</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Congratulations, you got yourself a rag head,
my man.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Dag.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: “Gettin’ bugged drivin’ up and down the same
old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip, I get around
–”</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: I didn’t think I’d see anyone get shot
over here.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: It looked like the guy’s head blew three feet
into the air –</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: Bullshit, that’s not what happened.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I said it looked like that happened, but then
we got here and he was still breathing.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #2</strong>: Oh, my God, it’s just like ‘Predator,’
where the guy, the black guy –</p>
<p><strong>soldier #3</strong>: Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot
off.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on
firing.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Take my picture.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Do you still want to sell pictures?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: For twenty.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Twenty dollars, man, what’s the meaning
of life?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You’re lucky you got to see anybody shot in
this war.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: War’s been over five days, Jim, ain’t gonna be
much more of this.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Bobby, take my picture.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #4</strong>: If he shot the guy, it’s up to him.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: It’s not like he shot a fucking deer.
It’s the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Troy’s enemy, yours for twenty.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Accept no substitute, this is the real thing,
oh, Jesus –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I got a really bad headache all of a
sudden–</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: No free pictures, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Spirits are high and the music is
boisterous as these young troops celebrate – Shit. Let me try that
again.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Spirits are high and the music is
fucking motherfucking sand in my eye –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Is that what you got from this
experience? A goddamn watch?</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: Ees a great fucking watch.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: There’s 700 million in gold out there
and you’re fucking around with a watch?</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: Bon dieu de merde, that’s a lot of gold,
man.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: One bunker of gold and we retire from
this horseshit, Hashy–</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Gates.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Just a second. The problem, Hash, is
how do you find it?</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: Like one sowsan bunker out sair –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair,
Hash, how do you find Saddam’s bullion?</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Could I have some help over here, for
Chrissakes?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: My goodness, Bill, what seems to be
the problem?</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: I’m trying to do a story here and the
fucking sand is blowing in my face –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You want me to stop the sand? I can’t
do anything about that.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: No, you’re too busy talking about the
fucking gold, which by the way makes a great story if you’d get me a
goddamn lead on it –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I think the Saddam story goes more for
the jugular, journalistically speaking, I mean, he’s still here beating
the shit out of his country.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Would you just be my guide and not my
fucking producer? You’re my guide.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: OK, go do your celebration story,
Bill.</p>
<p><strong>smash to</strong>: Rowdy soldiers mug for Smithson’s
camera.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: We’re number one.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #6</strong>: Waaaa-hooooo–</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: You’re heroes.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #6</strong>: We’re heroes.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #7</strong>: Give war a chance.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: You’ve exorcised the ghosts of
Vietnam with a clear moral imperative –</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Is that what we did?</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Where the hell are you going?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: I don’t want you helping other
reporters, goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: We kicked ass.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #6</strong>: We didn’t get rid of fucking Saddam
–</p>
<p><strong>soldier #8</strong>: Which totally sucks a big dick.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #6</strong>: Those people are getting reemed –</p>
<p><strong>soldier #7</strong>: Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Who’s getting reemed? The
Shiites?</p>
<p><strong>soldier #8</strong>: I don’t know who they are, man –</p>
<p><strong>soldier #6</strong>: We got big firepower but we ain’t saving
them –</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: Weehaaaaaaa.</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: ‘If tomorrow all the things were gone that
I worked for all my life and I had to start again with just my children
and my wife–’</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: ’I’d thank my lucky stars to –</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilots</strong>: ‘–be livin’ here today because the
flag still stands for freedom and they can’t take that awayyyyy –’</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: And I’m proud I to be an American, where at
least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died, who gave
that right to me. And I’d gladly stand up; next to you and defend her
still today. Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land, God bless the
U S A –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Rahhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: Goddamn it, where the fuck did
this beer come from we gotta take more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: Hasnala shi aluno quibaan –</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: We will not hurt you. Lay down
your weapons, get on the ground –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s cool, no one’s gonna hurt you –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait,
Abdul?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You’re making them all hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Take your fucking rags off, take this off. No
comprende English, motherfucker?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What is your fucking problem, Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I’m trying to git him to obey the spirit of
things but he won’t take his rags off.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Sir? We need you to disrobe like all the other
towel heads, OK?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Whoa, it’s a freaky thing, Troy.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: There’s a document in that guy’s ass,
Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: That’s the freaky thing.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you think he ate it?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It wouldn’t come out perfect like that if he
ate it.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Go get it, Private.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi officer</strong>: Hasa man timal!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Open it up.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You only gave me one glove.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m sorry I don’t have another, but you gotta
open it up. That’s how the chain of command works.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Important enough to squeeze your cheeks
for.</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: You are a trained warrior, trained
warrior, trained warrior, Jesus Christ, Colonel!</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: What’s Bill got?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Just the celebration story.</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That’s it –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: How about you? Did you find
anything?</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: It could be another bullshit lead but
I need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold
–</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Who’s the guy?</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Barlow.</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: Got a map out of a prisoner’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Out of a prisoner’s head?</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: Or his ear, or his ass, or his dick,
and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of Saddam’s bunkers
–</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Out of a guy’s dick?</p>
<p><strong>general pye</strong>: This is not the way we service the
media, Major. Stop her –</p>
<p><strong>mp</strong>: You are in violation of code 37D, grinding Major
Gates.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You guys have no manners whatsoever
–</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: I told you he was with her –</p>
<p><strong>general pye</strong>: We’re handling this, OK?</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: I wanted help with the gold story,
and he took off on me–</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That’s a lot of bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>general pye</strong>: I give you a prestige job in the media
war of the century and the guy feels neglected.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I’m helping him plenty with his big
celebration feature – Where did you get this fucking star?</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: They made me a general, pal.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: For what? I don’t even know what we
did over here, but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, Powell
gets to be fucking president–</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Are you high? This is a huge win for
us.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Running the press pool’s a real big
win for me.</p>
<p><strong>general pye</strong>: You want us to kill more Americans to
occupy Iraq?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I’m just saying it’s ironic, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: What the fuck is ironic?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We got the biggest army in the world
here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that’s how the
world works I guess.</p>
<p><strong>general pye</strong>: Just take care of Smithson and maybe
he’ll hook you up to consult on movies.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: It’s either that or be a security
guard when you retire.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Fuck you, Ron.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: I’m a general now, you can’t say fuck
you to me.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: OK, sir, but there’s another thing I’d
like to say, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Go right ahead, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You’ve washed your hands like a thousand
times, Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a
dune koon.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why do you let this cracker follow you
around?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s a good kid.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’s a wall-eyed cracker.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s got no high school, man, he’s from a
group home in Jackson –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I don’t give a shit if he’s from Johannesburg.
I don’t want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Captain uses those terms.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: The point is, Conrad, ‘towel head’ and ‘camel
jockey’ are perfectly good substitutes.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I’m sorry, man, it’s a little confusing is
all.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What can I do for your headache?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Got any Vicadan?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: All gone. How about Caffergot?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Excellent. Let’s translate my Iraqi ass
map.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Van Meter’s at the big pow wow?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’re cool for at least three hours, but keep
Walter on the door.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Would you take those fucking things off?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I never got to use night vision.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: They don’t work during the day and stand
outside the tent.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: These are definitely Saddam’s bunkers near
Karbala.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What’s inside?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: According to Intelligence – Picasso, Armani,
Rolex, Mercedes, Sony you name it – Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and
Saddam sacked it.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten
BOS speakers –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Silver Lexus convertible.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Lexus doesn’t make a convertible.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yes, they do.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Infiniti has one coming.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You can’t get a car home from here anyway.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: If I get enough Rolexes I could buy one when I
got home.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: One gold Rolex, I get a very fine split level
outside Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: My one problem, see, is the risk here –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What risk? We already did the risk. I signed up
last year to bank some computer training–</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Next thing I know I’m sitting here waiting to
get hit by a Scud. I put my life on the line for what purpose I’m not
sure, and now the good Lord puts this map in my path –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He could put a land mine in your path if we
try to find this place –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You’re safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Cuz you have a galactic plutonium
forcefield.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I don’t talk about it. But I do have a ring of
Jesus fire.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You have a ring of Jesus fire.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I was fire baptized.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I was baptized in water.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m fire baptized.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t even know what water baptism
means.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: For those who understand, no explanation is
necessary; for those who don’t, no explanation will suffice. You can
benefit from my Jesus ring if you do right by me, you got that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This tent is restricted –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Get the fuck out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: May day, may day –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Would this be the proctology tent?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yes, sir, I mean, no, sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Then maybe it’s the urology tent.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Captain’s at a staff meeting.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That’s OK, I’m not looking for a
proctologist or a urologist I’m looking for Sargeant Barlow.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You’re on the path to truth when you
smell shit, isn’t that what they say?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I don’t recognize you, sir. Are you in this
division?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’s not in this division. He’s Special
Forces.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’s the guy taking Bill Smithson around.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: And you would be the Three Wise Men,
right, Mappy, Slappy, and Pappy –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That leaves Cappy outside.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Damn. Freeze. Do not pass. Hold it, freeze.
Stop. Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: His name is Walter.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Did you good soldiers present this map
to Captain Van Meter?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Then I’ll take it to him.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We’ll take it to him. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It won’t do either of us any good
then, will it?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s our commander, sir. We’d have to tell him
you took it.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It could be nothing but a sandy love
letter from one Eye-raqi to another –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s a series of bunkers near Karbala.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the
map.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: May I look at the goddamn map?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Dag.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That’s what makes Rangers badass, we
get the best flashlights.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Still looks like a series of three
bunkers in three villages. A bit farther to the west.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Seventy-five klicks north.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: More like 65.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Much closer to Karbala.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a
big deal. Of course –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: – there could be nothing inside but
starving Arabs and stolen watches, but I think it’s worth checking out,
even if I have to do it with clueless reservists like you.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I mean, I could take the map, but you
could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we’ll do
the gold together.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What gold?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You don’t even know what’s inside
these bunkers, do you?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Rolexes.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Rolexes are swell, but I’m talking
about Kuwaiti bullion.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You mean the little cubes you put in hot water
for soup?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No. Not the little cubes you put in
hot water for soup.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Gold bricks.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: 5 kilos each, $50,000 in today’s
market.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: For one gold brick?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I’m sure Mr. Hussein has divided his
bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place
should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our
day jobs. Unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I don’t really have a day job.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What about the risk of taking a Humvee and all
that –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We do this shit all the time.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What else did you do, sir?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: In Panama we went sailing in Noriega’s
boats.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: In Vietnam, we got a big gold Buddha,
which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What about Iraqi soldiers?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Let’s see. They had the shit bombed
out them for two months, they’re deserting all over the place, and
they’ve completely surrendered to us. That’s a beaten army in every
sense of the word.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You are now under my command, salute
–</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What’s the guy’s name outside?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Cappy.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You will take Bill Smithson on a
special mission to find the gold story, but it will be a meaningless
ride that lasts all morning and takes him nowhere near Karbala, is that
clear?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How am I gonna get out of the company?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Your captain will be detained by a
friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be
Special Forces?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No, but if you talk to anybody about
this, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: How about if I lean on it, like
this?</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: Very dashing.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: Does it look too posed?</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: Would you ever stand like that?</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: I think I might, Jesus, this
feels stupid.</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: You’ll get used to it. First question:
did you dream as a boy you’d be commanding an infantry company in a
desert war?</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: As a boy, I wanted to be either a
veterinarian or a CIA sharpshooter –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Pull.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Pull.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Pull.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I gave you a better arc, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I threw the ball in a higher arc that was
easier for you to hit.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Blacks make better receivers than
quarterbacks.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Stop speaking right now, Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Warren Moon is an excellent quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: The Oilers have gone nowhere behind Warren
Moon.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Randall Cunningham.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Don’t get down in the mud with him, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: The Eagles will never get to the Superbowl with
him.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Doug Williams took the Redskins to the
Superbowl and won, OK?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We can all agree there are many excellent
black quarterbacks.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: This gun’s too heavy to shoot one-handed like a
movie star –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: When we pull up to the bunker, the
approach is something called violence of action, which is standard in
special operations. It means your movement is so fast and decisive that
the guards are frozen and we haven’t fired a single shot.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We dropped a lot of bombs out here and
we buried some guys alive –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Bradleys with big plows cut through
the berms and covered the trenches –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: They had the option to surrender, but
they chose to die for their country.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Let’s rehearse.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’ll say the cow is the primary guard
outside the bunker. We pull up fast, and stop short.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: And – Go.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Who’s hurt?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s all cow, I think.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Yeah, it’s all cow.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: They said this was swept for mines.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Mines are forever, Doc. They never get
all of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: ‘If you could, help me Rhonda, help help me
Rhonda –’</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Did you guys see any action at
all?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Only night bombing on CNN, except for Troy’s
supercool shooting that guy in the neck–</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Is sepsis cool?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What’s sepsis?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Infection of the blood.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: As in septic tank, because that’s what
happens when a bullet hits you. The lead tears in there –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Makes a cavity of dead tissue that
closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all gunshot wounds. The
cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and you’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: But other than a wound that blinds,
paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound I’ve ever seen is something
called tension pneumo thorax –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I heard something about that –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Tension pneumo what?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: A bullet, or a blade doesn’t kill you,
but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little
air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon.
And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your
lung, your liver, your heart. Your own breathing kills you, one breath
at a time – kinda like a job you can’t stand or a bad lie you once
told.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s not fatal, they can stop it.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: If you know how to make another little
hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an
overinflated tire.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The goddamn Beach Boys.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys. It
calms me down. Better than Mozart.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Bach.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Where’s the bunker?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It should be right –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No – there.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: We are the Army of the United States of
America. We are here to protect you. Remain calm.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Orders from President Bush, step
aside.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi mother</strong>: No milk. Baby milk.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Do not panic. Step outside –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: We are here for your protection and safety.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Ya’ll be cool now, this is the U.S. Marines in
charge here.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>friendly iraqi</strong>: I am love United States of Freedom.
I am hate Saddam.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Ya – ya – ha –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>friendly iraqi</strong>: No problem, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>friendly iraqi</strong>: You look for the chemical
weapon?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No. We look for the gold.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Where’s the gold?</p>
<p><strong>friendly iraqi</strong>: They move the gold.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Kill him now.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>friendly iraqi</strong>: This bunker. I’ll take you.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Ma-Maa.</p>
<p><strong>armed iraqi soldier</strong>: Ganan azwar!</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Move. Out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>shiite woman</strong>: Hos-pital.</p>
<p><strong>shiite man</strong>: America help.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Give them MRE’s.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: This is boring, I already did this
damn story, goddamn it, where the hell is the gold?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How about rare pelican migration out by the
marshes?</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: These brave pelicans are migrating in spite
of massive pollution –</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Fuck that. Stop the bike.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m all right, I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What is the art of war, because it is
not for killing people, it’s a stratagem to give life to many by killing
the evil perpetrated by a few – I am burning up in this goddamn suit
–</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Discriminating use of violence as a
last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that’s what I
learned, that’s what I’m good at. But now they underestimate all this,
bomb the same towns for six weeks and still leave the scumbag dictator
to starve and butcher his own people.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t even know what happened back there.
Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were
shooting the civilians and ignoring us –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: They already surrendered to us. Now they’re
after Shiites.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What exactly is a Shiite?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: They make up the ethnic majority but
they don’t have any power. When Bush pulled us out, he told them to
start a civil war to bring Saddam down, and now they’re getting
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: The civil war? How could it be the civil
war?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s a war inside the same country, Conrad.
That’s a civil war.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Put these on, we are now U.S.
Marines.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I can’t do this, OK? Because I’ve got a family
and if I shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz I got shot after the
war’s already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What is the most important thing in
life?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Did you hear anything I said.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Respect is the most important.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Too dependent on other people.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Comes and goes, man.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What is this bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What’s the most important thing?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Necessity. That’s what dictates what
will happen at any given time in life. Necessity says we don’t spend
American lives taking out Saddam, which leaves Saddam the necessity of
taking out the Shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take
the gold.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We could’ve been shot.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Did you notice they didn’t touch us?
We decimated their entire country. They’re scared shitless of us.
There’s time to try another bunker. I say we go.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: OK. And I’ll be wearing fashionable kevlar. As
a necessity.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: I’m at some goddamn marsh, all we’ve
seen are Russian cranes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Pelicans.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: I think the Saddam story goes more
for the jugular, journalistically speaking, Al. Let’s grow some balls
and do the Shiite uprising, for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: We’re going north to do the
Shiites.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I thought the gold was the hot spot.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Karbala’s the new hotspot, and I’m
driving.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Military regulations, you cannot drive.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Get off the vehicle, sir.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t make me shoot you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: The M-16 is the basic weapon of
the infantry. During Vietnam, it was fully automatic.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Doug?</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: Yes, General.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: Well, I’m giving an interview
to</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Do you have authorization?</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Who gave you this?</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: Major Gates.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Archie Gates gave you this? Jesus
Christ, Doug, come with me.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: I don’t get to do the
interview?</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: No, you don’t get to do the
interview.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Faster.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: United States Marine Corps. Put your
weapons down.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Drop your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Don’t make me smoke your ass, Abdul.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: By order of the cease-fire signed in
Safwan, March 3, the United States Marines hereby confiscate all
material stolen by Iraq from the Emirate of Kuwait –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Down.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi rifle-loader</strong>: Isnam panan fatwa aznir –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Never hit anyone with your pistol,
Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi captain</strong>: For wife.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I’ve been divorced three times.</p>
<p><strong>rifle iraqi #2</strong>: Newest and best.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No, newest and best has better noise
reduction.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Less distortion. Get down on the floor,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: This is bad music, understand? It’s bad for
you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hey –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Where’s the gold, Captain? Tell us so
we don’t have to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: There’s another room over here.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi sargeant</strong>: I am just do my job, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: These Shiite. Iraq problem. United
States is out now.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: We take them outside, so it don’t
bother you, OK, sir? Kata fanam.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Take us to the basement.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Don’t start this shit again.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I know ya’ll Shiite gettin’ yer asses whipped –
Hey, what the hell is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Git on the fucking ground, Arab.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi sargeant</strong>: Prisoner stay. Gabar matan.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>iraqi sargeant</strong>: Kinam vanir! Vanir!</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Goddamn it everybody calm down.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi captain</strong>: It’s my ass, donkey dick, Saddam will
shoot me dead.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Saddam worries more about the Shiite
than the gold.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: This is the United States Military.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi captain</strong>: It’s Saddam’s gold.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Shut up, he signed the treaty.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Listen to me: we leave you alone to
kill your Shiites, but everything you took from Kuwait, that belongs to
us now, understand?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Put it back.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Stick to the plan. The plan is for
gold.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Is this five kilos?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Yeah, that’s five kilos.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Five, six, seven, eight, there’s sixty bricks
in this suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Times 50K each –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Three million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each.
That’s thirty million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m gonna get a fleet of Lexus convertibles in
different colors.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I told you Lexus doesn’t make a
convertible.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’ll bet you a Lexus they do.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: OK, you’re on for a Lexus, but it won’t be a
convertible.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: They didn’t get it here in these
bags.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The tensilary strength goes to 200 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Tensilary strength, it’s what the suitcase can
hold.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Why would you know that?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He works at an airport.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: 60 bars, 13 pounds each is like – 800 pounds.
The smaller Vuittons handle 65.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You got any more luggage here?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It’s crazy to take it all, we’re not
prepared for it. It’s crazy not to take it all, how can we leave it?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What’s the shipping plan?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I told you that’s handled.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: How is it handled? You have to tell us
now.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah, tell us now.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I’ve got a friend, he’s in French
Special Forces. He’s gonna put it in barrels filled with oil and bury
it. In a few weeks, he’ll drive it to Yanbu –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Where’s Yanbu?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It’s a port in Saudi.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Where another friend will ship it on a
Turkish boat up the Red Sea to Perpignan, where a French boat will take
it to Baltimore –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t know about getting them to Baltimore,
but these hat boxes ain’t gonna fit in the Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We need a trailer.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: OK, I’ll call U-Haul in Karbala to see what
they have on the lot today.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: See what you can get, Barlow.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Conrad, we need a trailer –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Did you get it? Troy, did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah, we got it.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Is it a lot?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah, it’s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: ‘Little deuce coupe with a fiat head mill,
she’ll walk a Thunderbird like it’s standin’ still –’</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: ‘She’ll do a hundred and forty with the top
end floored –’</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: ‘She’s my little deuce coupe –’</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We take the Kuwaiti gold. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: Saddam cannot keep.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No, Saddam cannot keep.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: Saddam have too many problem today.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: He certainly does.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: You need help to load?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We can do it ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: Hazal jarat finan.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: These man help you.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: You go away fast from this
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier’s knuckles and
wrists.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Let’s load up and get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Lay that one flat; OK, sideways –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: This isn’t gonna work.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Sure it is –</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: You need a truck.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’ll rig two carts.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Let’s take the truck.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re not taking their truck.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: We cooperate with peace accord. Please
take truck.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Let’s take the truck.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: Nazaran yafit haisul.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: This has to stop.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: You get your ass kick in a war, it
feel good to be strong again.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: You go now, please.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I don’t think so. I’m sure you know
about the Geneva Convention, right?</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Geneva convention? You bomb my house,
man.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: That Shiite man is leader of uprising.
He kill my man.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Archie, let’s stick to the plan, sir. The plan
is for gold, right?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We can help them first, then be on our way.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No, we can’t. It’s not what we’re here
for.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: How much gold do you want to let these
people come with us?</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Cannot do.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What do you mean, cannot do? I’m
offering you a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: Cannot let Shiite go –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Saddam kill us.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: Saddam kill to me if we let them go,
OK? Now you go.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Cover me.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Jesus Christ, we can’t save everybody.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Are you listening? I said cover
me.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is that
clear?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Because we know what bullets do to
vital organs, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Make infected pockets filled with bile,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That’s right, that’s what they do.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi major</strong>: U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No shooting.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Accident. Stay cool.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>slightly slow motion</strong>: WHIP PAN from Iraqi rifle to
Archie.</p>
<p><strong>slightly slow motion</strong>: Troy fires his pistol. NO
SOUND except for the SLOW MOTION SOUND of the BULLET EXPLODING.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: The bullet tears through Iraqi 6’s
chest.</p>
<p><strong>regular speed</strong>: Vig swings the mounted machine gun
from one Iraqi to another, but still doesn’t shoot. He looks terrified
as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.</p>
<p><strong>slightly slow motion</strong>: a bullet tears into Troy’s
chest with a DULL SNAP. He winces in pain.</p>
<p><strong>slightly slow motion</strong>: Vig swings the mounted machine
gun and</p>
<p><strong>fires. no sound but the slow cracks of the red tracer
bullets</strong>: EXPLODING from the gun.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: tracer bullets slice across the face of
Iraqi 5 and Iraqi 2 in the rear, NO SOUND BUT THE BULLETS BREAKING</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Archie jams his pistol under the
Major’s chin and FIRES – the ONLY SOUND IS THE. SLOW EXPLOSION OF THE
GUN, and the slow tearing of tissue, ending with a sharp SNAP as the
tissue, bone, and the bullet CRACK out the top of the Iraqi Major’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Cover these three.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Down.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi soldier</strong>: Kazal stan hamir in fatar.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Put the Shiites in the Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: There’s no room.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Make room.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What the fuck happened to necessity?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It just changed.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Obey the fucking order, Barlow.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: This is fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What if that was you?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What if this was you not wearing Kevlar?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Great, a fucking tank. That should send us on
our way.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Grenade launcher, sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s about fucking time.</p>
<p><strong>tank iraqi</strong>: Hazal mafan.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We were home free, you stupid son of a
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What’s the tank doing?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Lining us up –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Incoming.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Stay on the road.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I don’t wanna get hit.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Doc looks straight up with the
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line
of smoke across the sky.</p>
<p><strong>rear of humvee, slow motion</strong>: half the Shiites hunch
down, bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their necks,

<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We have to wait until it clears.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You made the choice and we lost Troy –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You had a choice.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I had no fucking choice.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I can’t walk away from a crime like
that and take the gold and live my life like nothing happened, and if
you can, then I hope you die right now.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What about Troy? What choice does he have
now?</p>
<p><strong>iraqi soldier</strong>: Can we shoot him?</p>
<p><strong>iraqi soldier #2</strong>: We’re not even supposed to have
American prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: He’s proof they broke the cease-

miss you.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I miss you, too.</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: The wall just exploded.</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: I thought the war was over, honey.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It is and it isn’t, babe. Can you do me a
favor and call the C.O. on base?</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: You want me to call the C.O.?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Tell him I’m stuck in a bunker near 223 north
outside Karbala –</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: What do you mean ‘stuck’? I thought the war
was over.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m gonna be fine, honey, I don’t want you to
worry, I tried to do something for the family, and I want you to know

<p><strong>darlene</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: That I love you.</p>

<p><strong>troy</strong>: Gotta go, gooney-bird, I love you–</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: Troy?</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Spirits are high and the music is
soaring as these young troops celebrate –</p>

troops in the gritty city of Karbala, where Shiite –</p>
<p><strong>paco</strong>: You said gritty city again.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: OK, we’ll go again.</p>

<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Let’s lay a few of these down first.
In three, two, and, I’m being held captive in a gritty suburb of
Karbala, where Shiite fundamentalists are rising up –</p>

reporter see you doing this.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi sargeant</strong>: Hey, that’s the CNN guy.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi captain</strong>: Wow. He’s much shorter in person.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi captain</strong>: Get them out of here now.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: At least let me keep the tape.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Could I have my helmet, please?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Helmet. On my head.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Who’s missing?</p>

<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: How about Barlow?</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Check all the radio transmissions.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: I run a tight company, Ron. Don’t

bro, you got no respect for the children. That’s why you bomb them over

<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Michael Jackson is Pop King of sick
fahking country.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Bullshit wrong, dude. A black man make
the skin white and the hair straight. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Your sick fahking country make the
black man hate hisself, just like you hate the Arab and the children you

<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t hate children.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Do they care, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Does who care?</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Do your army care about the Shiite
children? Do they come to help?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No, they’re not coming.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: That seemed like too much volts. You

<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Just figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Are they coming to help the
Shiite?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No.</p>

Troy, I don’t want nothing to happen to him, he’s my friend. Doc? Come
on, man, I know you was comin’ to help me –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Maybe we got kicked out of the ring of Jesus
fire, on account of stealing.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s not how it works.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I take care of what Jesus puts in front of me.
That’s what we did with the gold.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What about now?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m gonna see.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: How you doing, Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I’m good to go, chief.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Let’s check the suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’re missing 28.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That leaves 92 suitcases, five bars
each –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: 23 million dollars. Not bad for a
disaster, provided we can find Barlow, get back before dark and not get
busted.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It was my choice today. So you can
head back if you want. I’ll find Barlow myself.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What about the gold?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Take what you can carry. Try to find a
vehicle. Bury what you have outside camp. Be careful about it.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I want to find Troy.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: OK, where does that leave us? We don’t
have any water, we’re dehydrated. You got a radio here?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How – is – your – little girl?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Broken – arms. Girl.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: She’s traumatized, what the fuck do
you expect?</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: I went to b-school at Bowling
Green.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What’s b-school? Is that like terrorist
training?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Business school, Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: I came back to open a couple of
hotels near Karbala. I’m almost in the black when Saddam starts this
stupid fucking war and you guys bomb the shit out of my cafes. Now we
try to get rid of Saddam, Bush leaves us twisting in the wind, Un-
be-fucking-lievable man.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You got a radio?</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: No radio. No water.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Where’s Barlow?</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: They got him, I saw it happen. And
they won’t take him back to the same place.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Where would they take him?</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: Oasis Bunker. It’s full of Saddam’s
hard core guys.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: Like 17 - 18 klicks from here.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Take us there.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: We got no wheels.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’ll walk until we find some.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: Why don’t you call in the
Marines?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: With what? We don’t have a radio.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: OK, we’ll find a vehicle. You drive
back to get the choppers, they fly in to get your man.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: Why not? You got a huge army
here.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re not supposed to be involved with
Shiites. We killed Iraqi soldiers. We broke the peace- accord.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: Tell them it happened when you
reclaimed the gold. Don’t tell them it was about us.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: They’d find out, we’d go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: You know what I think? I think maybe
you’re boosting the gold. That’s what I think.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: They got half a million men in the
desert, they send four guys to pick up all this bullion? I don’t think
so.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We need to find our man. How much do
you want to take us there?</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: Fifteen suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That’s too much.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Give it to him. We’ve got a lot.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re gonna need it to buy our way
back today, so we better spend it wisely. I’ll give you eight.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: You need some guns, right? You lost
your gear.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Yeah, we need some guns.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: You need some fighters, too. I mean,
you can try to take Oasis on your own, but look at these grunts –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Yeah, OK, we need some fighters.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: So that’s worth more than eight
suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: That’s four million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>man in glasses</strong>: I think we need it more than you,
John Doe, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Archie Gates.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Imam Katar. I’ll give you back five suitcases
to get us over the Iranian border.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: We gotta get to a refugee camp or we’re dead.
The camps are in Iran.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We can’t go to the Iranian border.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Then we don’t have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Give me a fucking break, man.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: And we saved yours.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We lost a man for you.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: What good is it if you leave us to get wasted?
The big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich
Kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator.
You saw what happened to my wife. Look at my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Who’s going?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Everyone but the priests. That’s 55.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Fuck it. We’ll find this place on our own.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: It’s not on a map. You can look.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Somebody else will take us.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Who will take us to Oasis bunker?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Jarat yalam fantam uraz.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: This is a human life we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: I only join Saddam Hussein army to
make good living for family, good car, good house, and now my son is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I signed up for the extra cash, too.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: We got a lot in common, dude. I got
training and guns from America.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Not from America.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to
Iraq, train us when we fight Iran.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What did they train you in?</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Weapons, sabotage. Interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: So what we get from this dirty Iraq
war you and me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: You don’t fahking know, right?! We all
scahmbag soldier who get fahked, right?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: So why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: It’s my job, man, for Saddam, just
like your job when you bomb my house.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s not just a job, it still matters what you
do.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Bullshit. It’s all a job.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It still matters what you do, what you’re
doing right now matters.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: The art of war is not for killing people, it’s
a stratagem to give life to many with minimum violence, minimum –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Then why you bomb my fahking house and
kill my son? Can you think how it feels inside your heart if I bomb your
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Worse than death –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: It feels like this –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Everyday, inside my heart –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Like this, like this, like this –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Did we save anything from the
Humvee?</p>

<p><strong>vig</strong>: Whatever. They’re both attractive names.</p>
<p><strong>high wide shot</strong>: A lone Iraqi military truck, mint
condition.’</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: This is the United States Army. Come
out of the truck with your weapons in the air.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Shit. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: They used a lot of decoys to throw off
our bombers.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where are we gonna get a vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: I know a place that’s full of deserters. Maybe
they got something.</p>
<p><strong>high wide shot</strong>: They walk in a single file line in
the desert. Archie in front, carries a Vuitton bag.</p>
<p><strong>shiite</strong>: America!</p>
<p><strong>shiite #2</strong>: America! Friend!</p>
<p><strong>shiite</strong>: Freedom! Thank you to America!</p>

<p><strong>vig</strong>: Judas Priest will pump you, Doc –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I already had it with the Beach Boys today.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: One song.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We get our man, we come back to pick
up the gold –</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: And my people.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: My gold isn’t here, and I mean all of
it, your people will not survive.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: OK. Let’s load and go.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Wait a second, I want to talk about this plan
some more –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re going to drive in and get Troy,
exactly like we discussed.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I have a bad feeling like we’re gonna get
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You’re scared. It’s good to be scared
when there’s guns around.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m cool. I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Your son wouldn’t be dead if Saddam didn’t
invade Kuwait.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I heard about some bad shit that happened
there.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Who’s got the sick country?</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right? And
then you are crazy to bomb all of Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Too much bombing is crazy, but not saving
Kuwait.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: You come here to save Kuwait
people?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Really? Jahaza fan.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Lots of people in trouble around this
world, my man. You don’t fight no fahking war for them.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You invaded another country. You can’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Why not, dude?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It makes the world crazy. You got to keep it
stable.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: For what? Your pick up truck?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No, for stability. Stabilize the region.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: This is your fahking stability, my
main man.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Splinter.</p>
<p><strong>shiite</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Go straight, go straight –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Are you feeling stable enough for
more?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Stop shooting, what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Jesus God, I don’t wanna get hit, please Jesus,
watch over me –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: It’s OK, buddy, we are just talking
now –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You gotta be my disguise, Mr. Shiite, cuz they
need my help over there –</p>
<p><strong>tough iraqi</strong>: Let’s go back and get them.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi #2</strong>: Fuck a donkey, no way.</p>
<p><strong>tough iraqi</strong>: There’s a chopper, we can do it.</p>
<p><strong>tough iraqi</strong>: They killed your families, you fucking
cowards.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re gonna get out of here alive,
just do what I say, do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Step, throw, one-two – I’m gonna give
it a five second fuse. That gives you two steps out the door.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Wait –</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: God help me.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: OK. Shorter fuse this time.</p>
<p><strong>chopper</strong>: Archie, Doc, Troy, three abreast,
mid-stride.</p>
<p><strong>slightly slow motion</strong>: The chopper comes crashing to
the ground in a heap of metal. The rotary spins off, whips over Archie,
Troy, and Doc’s heads and smashes into the bunker.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re not done. Check every Iraqi
here.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Where’s Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Don’t let your guard down.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Stay there, don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Jakar yizam ut naral –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: How are we getting back?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We got the Rolls.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You got a Rolls?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It’s been a busy day.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hey. That’s a convertible.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Keep your fucking guard up.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Is that leather interior?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I think he’s in shock.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s a fucking Infiniti convertible, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: OK. So I owe you a car. I’m not in shock.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We can talk about cars later, OK?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Freeze –</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: He’s with us.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You’re the guy with the little girl.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: He helped us find you.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: All right. You’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: How’s your girl?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: She’s safe. For the moment.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: All right. Excellent. How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Calm down, man.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m calm. Don’t I look calm?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: We had a deal to get us to the border, but we
need more vehicles for these people.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We’re gonna work it out. We can do it. We have
to work it out.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m not sure how. This is a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: OK, you choose who we take. You tell the
others it’s not convenient, they’ll have to die.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Take it easy, man.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You think I don’t know what I’m saying. I know
what I’m saying. We’re gonna do more than steal, that’s what I’m saying.
We’re gonna help these people out.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: This guy was worth saving.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: He’s a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Yes. Yes. All right.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You made it.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: I thought that was you. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Cover him.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Lock it down. Shoot anything that
moves.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Haza janav yasat.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You made it, man –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Help him.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: What happened to the Jesus fire, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s around you right now, man, it works on
this side or the other side.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: You never told me that part. I guess I could go
to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We made the right choice today, Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: We did good, right?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We made the right choice.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Dear Lord watch over this man, help him if you
can. Our father who art in heaven –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Help.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: – hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy
will be done –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Take my picture.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: Do you still want to sell pictures?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: For twenty.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Twenty bucks?</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: War’s been over five days, ain’t gonna be any
more of this, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Twenty dollars, man, what’s the meaning
of life?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You’re lucky you got to see anybody shot in
this war.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: Bobby, take my picture.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #4</strong>: If he shot the guy, it’s up to him.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #5</strong>: It’s not like he shot a fucking deer.
It’s the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>vig</strong>: It’s Troy’s enemy, yours for twenty.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I’ve been waiting 18 years to get that
right.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s got no family.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re his family now.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He wanted to go to one of those shrines.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Good. Take him.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Air pressure will build up about every
fifteen minutes. Release the valve, close it up again.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: How long can I keep doing this?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Maybe four hours, if you’re not
bleeding too bad inside.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m really thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: There’s no water anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: I got you hooked up if you want to call your
man.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do you
read me?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’re gonna be court-martialed.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No, we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are you
reading this?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This is Tar Baby, come in.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: About two clicks outside camp.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’re about ready for the briar patch,
over.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You got me, Tar Baby?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think so – who handles the briar
patch?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You do.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to the briar
patch if everything’s OK, right?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: No, the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Shit, I’m sorry, sir, I don’t remember how
the code goes –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wow. That’s a tall order for a secret
operation, sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Talk to my friend Hash. Each driver
will get 100K.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you say 100K?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North. Add
one medavac pack to the order, and dump the reporter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Roger. Give me two hours.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: There’s so many transmissions
–</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Narrow it down to what sounds like
Archie Gates and a Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: I want a direction, we’re not gonna
comb the whole goddamn desert –</p>
<p><strong>private</strong>: This is from Barlow’s C.O. at Fort Bragg,
something with his wife.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Fort Bragg? I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: Where the hell is he going now?</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: I say we keep watching the
General.</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got yourself
shot.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Those better be words of sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Watcha doing out here, Troy?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Protecting the free peoples of the world,
Walter, you know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We better get you fixed up to go home to the
land of the brave.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Give me that penicillin, baby.</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: Where ees bullion at, my man?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Bullion ees buried. I’ll show you
after we get these people to the border.</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: Iranian border?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Part of the deal.</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: C’est super, Archie, you got yourself a
pain in the ass mission of mercy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sorry I fucked up the code, sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: It means we gotta move. They might be
coming for us.</p>
<p><strong>havichon</strong>: What are you seenking?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: I see an opening we can walk through.
But it’s not wide enough for a truck.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We’ll walk them to the border. The
Iranians will take them. We’ll walk back to the trucks and get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Make a close group.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Jihad yamat – yamat.</p>
<p><strong>faces</strong>: CLOSE DOLLY - SHIITE Children, Women, Men, as
they fearfully walk toward the border. The five U.S. Drivers flank the
Shiites on either side, rifles ready.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Let the air out.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s not the air, I don’t know what it is
–</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Stay back.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m all right. I’m just dizzy or something
–</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Double time.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Let them get over the border.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Let them get over, wait –</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I have to reach this –</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Put his cuffs in front.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Look what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: Not our mission, Barlow.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Cut my cuffs –</p>
<p><strong>captain van meter</strong>: You fucked me and you’re fucked
now, so shut your goddamn mouth.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’s gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical
attention, don’t let him die –</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: We are not involved in the Shiite
problem, do you understand me? You are AWOL, you are a fugitive, you are
under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Cut his cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We got the gold.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: We got the Kuwaiti bullion.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: Pull that barrel.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Pull it.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: How much do you have?</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: 4 tons.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Where’s it at?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Get them over first.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: They helped us get it, Ron. I made a
deal, and that’s soldier’s honor. You can’t fuck them now.</p>
<p><strong>archie gates</strong>: You can return this gold, be a big
hero, get another star maybe.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Let’s go, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Who’s in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: We have to talk about this
situation.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: In a morbid tableau these men have
recovered some of the gold bullion stolen from Kuwait –</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: –in violation of American policy,
saved over a hundred Shiite refugees while recovering stolen Kuwaiti
gold –</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Turn that damn camera off.</p>
<p><strong>bill smithson</strong>: That’s a 75 thousand dollar camera
–</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: What the fuck are they doing here?</p>
<p><strong>sargeant</strong>: I thought they were authorized –</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: They are not fucking authorized, for
Christ’s sake –</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: Haven’t I taken care of you,
dammit?</p>
<p><strong>cathy daitch</strong>: I’m gonna get that tape back.</p>
<p><strong>general horn</strong>: You are under arrest. You are going to
be court-martialed. And you will show us where the bullion is right
now.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #10</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>music continues</strong>: Doc Elgin takes Vuitton bags
curbside at Kennedy airport and is given a ten dollar tip.</p>
<p><strong>music continues</strong>: Archie on a film set, wearing
sunglasses, shows an action star how to push away the barrel of a bad
guy’s rifle.</p>
