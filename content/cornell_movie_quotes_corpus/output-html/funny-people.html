<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, it’s George Simmons, I’m coming in.</p>
<p><strong>college student</strong>: Hey George, can I get a picture
with you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure buddy. Let’s do it. One of the college
students put his arm around George while the other takes the
picture.</p>
<p><strong>college student #2</strong>: Can I get one?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah bud. They take the picture.</p>
<p><strong>college student</strong>: You’re the man. We love all your
movies, even the last one.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks. Tell your friends.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I like those lunestas. They really put me to
sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover I get from the
restorils.</p>
<p>****: I try not to take them too often. Just when I know I have to
get up early.</p>
<p><strong>doctor stevens</strong>: George there are some irregularities
in your blood work… George’s face turns white. He knows what this means.
The doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out– it is
now all a jumble of words.</p>
<p><strong>angle on george’s pov</strong>: We see photos of the doctor’s
family, his graduation certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor’s
office art, a picture of him skiing with his family. He keeps talking,
but now we hear nothing. MUSIC UP - “MY SHIT’s FUCKED UP” BY WARREN
ZEVON</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh my God. Can you take a picture with me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, sure. She puts her arm around him. Her
little brother jumps in too.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thanks. You are the funniest.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks, pal.</p>
<p><strong>!nt. car - day</strong>: George drives home. We hear the
voice of his doctor in his head.</p>
<p><strong>doctor stevens</strong>: It’s a rare blood disorder. In the
family of Hodgkins disease. We really don’t have a treatment for it.
There are things we can try. They’re all very experimental in
nature.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t understand what this means.</p>
<p><strong>doctor stevens</strong>: I think you need to hope for the
best and prepare for the worst. Is there someone who can help you get
your affairs in order?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Is the turkey organic?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well what does organic mean?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It means there’s no additives or preservatives
and it’s hormone free.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Are there additives or preservatives in the
food they feed the turkey?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I heard that because turkeys are fatty birds,
mercury gets stuck in their fat. My daughter-in-law, she ate turkey and
then she had a miscarriage.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I haven’t heard about that. But I may not be
informed enough to comment.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, you’re not a doctor, so you shouldn’t
comment.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You are correct, I am not a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You should come see me do stand-up tonight at
the Comedy and Magic Club.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I can’t go through that again, man, that was
painful.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That was five months ago. I’ve gotten a lot
better.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: They pay you yet?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Nah, not there. I just hang out and hope
somebody doesn’t show.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Wow, is there anyway for you to.be lower in
show business? I don’t know if you could even say you’re in show
business. Why don’t you just fucking settle down and enjoy this gig?
This is a sweet situation. The money’s good, you’ve got health
insurance.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Dude, I know you like it here but if I have to
work here another year I would kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Really? In that case, when we bury you does
it have to be in some kind of Jew cemetery? Next to Al Jolson or some
shit?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Just come. I need the support.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: No way. I’m funnier than you. And I’m not
even that funny. I would go if I was paying to see me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’ll pay your cover charge.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Okay, well you better be good, because I’m
bringing a date.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Laughter’s the ultimate lubricant.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was thinking about doing something about how
I’m not good looking and I’m not bad looking. I’m just good looking
enough that if I had a good personality, it could put me over the top.
If that was the case.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Yeah, something about how the uglier you are,
the better the personality you need. And the hotter you are, the
stupider you can be.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I had a joke once about how you never see
incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women. Because someone will always take
care of that kind of woman. That woman could be the dumbest person on
earth and she will survive in this world.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Maybe something like… you can be hot and stupid
and survive in the world. And you can be smart and ugly and survive in
the world. The people who have trouble are the stupid, ugly people.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That could work.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Let me keep that one, because I thought of most
of it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s not cool. I came up with the concept!
What do you got? Let’s work on what you have.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I’ve got nothing in the notebook. I got drunk
last night. But I need material, because I just got spots at the Improv.
Budd saw me and approved me. I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How could they make you a regular? I got turned
down twice.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Sorry, man. They’re only going to let in one
chubby, caustic Jew, so I think you’re fucked. Their other roommate,
MARK, walks in, waves a check at them.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hey, dudes. You see this check that I got from
my TV show for 25,000 an episode? There was another one of these on the
kitchen counter. Did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No we didn’t see it. Just don’t leave those
things laying around.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I wouldn’t leave it around if they didn’t give
me so many. They give it to me every episode.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Don’t throw it in our face that you’re on a
shitty show.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I wouldn’t, if it was a shitty show and not
what Time magazine called “insightful and delightful.”</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I thought you were moving out.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I decided I like it here. Living with you guys
keeps me grounded. I don’t want to be the guy living in the house on the
hill. Even though I could afford it. Hey, I saw that girl comic you like
who lives upstairs. I invited her in. She’s here.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: She’s in our apartment? I’ve never even talked
to her. I just gave her quarters at the washing machine.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You were right, she is pretty mousy and sexy.
You gotta talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I need time. I have a three-month plan.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’ll give you ten days for your three-month
plan, then I am going to fuck her. You can’t just leave that laying
around. Starting right now.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: The thing about working on a sitcom is it’s 22
weeks a year, so I can do stand-up the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: But now people want to see me because they see
me on a TV show, so I am kind of a draw. Have you seen the show?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: I don’t own a TV.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Well I think you can download it to an iPod.
Ira walks in.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hey Ira, this is Daisy.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Nice to meet you. I think I gave you quarters
once. Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup. He
pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup falls over and
spills all over the counter. Mark looks horrified.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll just lick it off the counter.
Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag.</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Schneider didn’t show up so, you can do ten
minutes after Leo.</p>
<p><strong>magician</strong>: Don’t go long because I have to load
pigeons into my suit. I have to let them out or they’ll die. I’m not
fucking around.</p>
<p><strong>magician</strong>: So when you get the light, don’t go long.
You’ve got one minute. ANGLE ON Leo on stage, doing a few more jokes. A
MANAGER walks over to Ira.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hey man. George Simmons just got here, he
wants to go up. You’re bumped. We’ll put you on after George.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well how long is he going to do?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I don’t know. Last night he did five
minutes. Last week he did an hour. fie’il do what he wants to do.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well what about the magician? He just loaded
his pigeons. He said I have to get off in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’ll have him unload the pigeons. Just be
ready. Leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: That was good, right? Some of the new stuff
worked.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I just got bumped by George Simmons.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Are you serious? Shit - I’ve got a spot at the
Improv, I cant hang out, damn.</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: A lot of times you hear about going to a
comedy club and someone exciting shows up. I won’t lie to you, that
usually never happens. But tonight it is happening.</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Ladies and gentleman, you know him from
George Simmons? George walks on stage. The place goes crazy. He does
some of his normal routine and the audience laughs and is very
appreciative. As George continues his act, it starts getting darker and
darker until he is talking about death and the lack of meaning in it
all.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ah life. What does it mean? sometimes life
makes perfect sense. And then you `come’.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He’s killing the crowd. Jesus, I can’t follow
this shit. After completely losing the crowd, and some minor
confrontations with audience members, he exits the stage.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Life isn’t all about laughs. Crazy shit
happens. You’ve got to be nice to each other. You never know what’s
going to happen. Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry I sucked it up out there. At least
they are well rested for you. Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to
do his act, but he is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to
take the weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage. He
basically bombs. We reveal Chuck and his date watching, looking
miserable.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m not good looking. I’m not bad looking. I’m
just in the middle. And if I had a personality that was Jut good enough,
it would put me over the edge. The joke fails. We reveal George also
watching him bomb, amused by his struggle. He sees something he likes in
Ira.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Sorry, man. I didn’t mean to disturb you. I
just can’t open my door. There’s no room.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh I’m sorry. Let me pull out. George pulls
the car back ten feet.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey man, you had some funny shit
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Man, that audience hated you. They really
did not like you. They liked your buddy, who looked exactly like you but
was funnier. Man, that’s going to haunt you. You’re going to wake up in
six months and think about this night.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well, I’ll probably bomb worse tomorrow and
forget about this one.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m just fucking with you. You had some
funny jokes in there. Good writing.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well, obviously, I’m a… you know…I grew up on
your shit, man. George just stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright, pal. Don’t worry. Only two hundred
people saw that tonight. I’ll see you later. George pulls out, turns the
car around, and as he passes by Ira, he steers his car as if he’s going
to run him down, and starts screaming…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re gonna die!!! I’m gonna kill you! Then
he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is the greatest thing
that’s ever happened to him.</p>
<p><strong>full screen computer</strong>: We see a comedy short made by
Leo. It’s very funny.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Holy shit, you got seven hundred thousand hits
in four days.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: They put it on the main page at YouTube and it
exploded. Which would be awesome if someone would pay me. The phone
rings.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, is this Ira?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yeah. Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s George.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I thought you and Leo were pretty funny last
night and I have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a
couple of days and I thought you guys could write me some jokes.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Definitely. What kind of jokes? Leo passes by
in the background. We see Ira decide not to include him in this job
offer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know, about computers and shit. I
could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a
little.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No problem. Where do you want me to send
em?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is your email? I will send you my fax
and email and all that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It’s a…irasexiraÂ®gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I almost just changed my mind. You got to
change that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Today. Seriously. Ok. Later. Ira hangs up
and turns to his friends.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That was George Simmons. He wants me to write
jokes for him.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Holy shit. That is awesome. You are so
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Are you gonna get to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know, but he is gonna send me his email
address.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: We are gonna have his email address? I have to
send him the link to my short.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Easy. Let me get in there a little more.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I got one, but you have to tell him its mine.
The best thing about Leopard is it lets you watch a porno, write a
porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. And you
guys made that possible. We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing.
He is writing an enormous amount of jokes. Way more than George will
ever need. Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re- typing, etc. Ira
hesitates, then hits send.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s some funny shit in here. Not a bad
ratio of good jokes to shit.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Thanks man. I just want to give you a lot of
choices.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Too many choices. I don’t like reading that
much. I need like ten good jokes. I’m a little mad you made me read that
many to get to ten. But thanks for doing it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh, it was fun to try to write in your voice. I
spent the whole night pretending I was you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So you cried yourself to sleep?</p>
<p>****: So you whacked off three times last night? Don’t worry, I’ll
get you some money. Is five hundred good?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yeah! That’ll work.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m leaving at four tomorrow to go to the
gig. You want to come check it out, see if your shit works?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Can we go outside and meet him?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No you can’t. Because then we look like
fans.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Maybe he’s seen my show.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He doesn’t watch your show. You’re show is for
eight-year-olds. It’s a family show, he doesn’t watch that shit.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I’ll just go outside and pretend I’-,n washing
my car. The Limo pulls up outside.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Holy shit. I feel like my little girl is going
to the prom.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How you doing, you ready for this?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yeah, this’ll be fun.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think I’m going to have you go on before
me to warn them up.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You don’t have to do that. What if I bomb?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, if you bomb, they’ll just be more
excited to see me. They’ll be so glad your not on stage any more. Then
if you do well, they’ll be ready for me. Either way, you’re helpful.</p>
<p><strong>i/e private jet - later</strong>: The limo pulls up to a
private jet. Ira is shocked. A moment later they’re picking up speed to
take off. George seems really relaxed. Nothing registers that the jet is
going faster and faster and taking off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I like this joke about watching porn and
making porn all at the same time. That was a good one.</p>
<p>****: Oh good. Yeah, I thought you’d like that one. I was really
happy with that one.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You want something to eat? I had them bring
Chinese on the plane. Ira’s eyes widen. He likes this way of life.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Okay, what do you want them to say when he
introduces you? Do you have any credits he should mention?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Uh…credits? I don’t really have any credits.
Maybe you could just say I’ve been working on Apples for so long, my
first one weighed more than I did. Nobody laughs.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And just say he’s a friend of mine, and I
think he’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the fuck is that? You did three of the
jokes that you wrote for me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I panicked. They just wanted jokes about
computers.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s why I hired you, to write jokes about
computers. Ira takes out the long list of jokes he’s written.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: But there’s a lot more. The first three on this
page. You didn’t think they would work, but I think they will. You
should just try them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They better kill, I’m getting paid a hundred
thousand dollars for this.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Are you serious? ANGLE ON DAVE on stage.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Ladies and gentleman, George Simmons. George
does a few Apple jokes that do kill, and then he segues into his normal
act. When he wants to be, he is a great performer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ll be on the ground in a half hour. Want
to go to a bar? Do something fun?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Sure. I like fun.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here’s a grand for the jokes and the gig.
Even though you should be paying me after that. Ira’s eyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good job.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s the most money I’ve ever made doing
anything in comedy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then this is an exciting moment.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well, I didn’t make a hundred grand like
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I feel nothing. I remember when a grand was
the most exciting thing in the world. I’d go to Red Lobster and go nuts.
Now it’s just numbers in a bank account. Enjoy tonight. You made a
thousand bucks.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, let’s all go back to my house.</p>
<p><strong>mandy</strong>: Great!</p>
<p>****: Yeah, that sounds like a… nice idea.</p>
<p><strong>mandy</strong>: This house is so big. It’s bigger than the
college I went to.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh there’s a whole other wing that you
wouldn’t even know existed unless you went through this door.</p>
<p><strong>mandy</strong>: I want to see, I want to see. George and
Mandy disappear. Ira and Dawn are left alone.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You are very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I have a boyfriend. Nothing is going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I didn’t say anything was going to happen. I
just said you were pretty. How do you even know I wanted something to
happen?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I hope she doesn’t take a long time.</p>
<p><strong>mandy</strong>: I can’t believe I’m having sex with
Davey!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He can’t believe he’s having sex with
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she
left.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry, that kind of stuff happens when you
have a big house.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Oh, well then I guess I better get going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You don’t have to go. I’m just saying that
she left. I think she left her purse in the other wing. Come with me,
let’s go get it. Ira watches this, astonished.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Did Ira tell you I have a room with all the
classic pinball machines and video games?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: That sounds awesome.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I got Galaga. Let’s go check it
out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey don’t go, I’ll be back in a second.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That girl left. You want to talk to me while
I try to go to sleep. Ira doesn’t know what to make of this.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Did you have sex with both of those girls?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m afraid I did. I’m sorry. It was just so
clear that you were not going to get it done. I figured you wouldn’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That is crazy. That is super crazy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It was great. It was crazy great.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How can that even happen? I guess I understand
the first one, but why would the second one do it? You probably stink of
the first girl.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, we took a steam shower together.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: she had never seen a steam shower before, I
told her she should enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: She wouldn’t fool around with me because she
said she had a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She told me that too, but she says I was on
her and her boyfriend’s list of people she was allowed to screw. You’d
be surprised how many women have me on that list.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I should get going.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just talk to me before I fall asleep. I’m
weird. I don’t like being alone. You should crash in one of the rooms.
You’re too drunk to drive home. I won’t try to fuck you, I just fucked
two women and I’m kind of done.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I may have to whack it in your guest room.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Whack away, I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p>****: Hey, you were funny tonight. I could see how you could get
good.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Thanks. That was fun. It was rare that I get to
play to more than twenty-five people. I’ve never played for a
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: it, s kind of easier, because even if two
hundred like me, it sounds like a lot.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I do feel bad for you, because no matter how
hard you try, you’ll never be as funny as me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Why would you say that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Did your dad crack you on the head when you
were a kid?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s why. My dad always seemed annoyed
with me. He’d always crack me on the head. You would not see it coming.
I spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he wouldn’t
smack me. But he was an awesome guy. He was the coolest. He just got
annoyed with me. Do you like your parents? They can’t be that bad,
because you’re not that funny.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: They’re bananas. And always broke. They got
divorced ten years ago, but they both act like it just happened last
week. They hate each other. They always put me in the middle of it. I
always wanted them to say, “We don’t want you to suffer through this, so
we’re just going to handle it ourselves.” They never would do it. They
would always make me feel their pain all the time. I would never do that
for my kids. Because it’s like they._`.re kids. And no matter how many
times I tell them to leave me out of it, they never do. Ira notices that
George is very close to falling asleep.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’ll let you crash.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, keep going. It’s interesting. Tell me
about your day job?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Alright. So… I work at a supermarket at the
deli counter. I hate it, but the money’s actually pretty good. Better
than you’d think. But I’d rather do comedy full-time if I could. The
camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin to HEAR George
snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey man, you want to make me breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: okay.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do you know how to cook anything?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Eggs.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, let’s have some eggs. While Ira is
cooking, George takes a lot of pills.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What are you doing, man? Are those
vitamins?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. Medicine. I’m sick.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve got some crazy blood disease. They
think I’m going to die in six months to a year. Some weird thing, almost
nobody has it. All these are experimental.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Are you fucking with me? That’s not funny,
man.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I’m telling you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I never heard that before. That would be a big
deal.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I haven’t told anybody yet. I don’t think
I’m going to.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You’re not going to tell anybody? You told
me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well it’s easier with you because I don’t
know you. I don’t feel weird around you. I don’t want to be treated like
a guy who’s going to die.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know, man. I don’t think you want to go
through this alone. I think you’ve got to tell people. Your family. Your
friends.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Actually, the reason why I only told you is
I need you to do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What? Anything, man.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I can’t imagine suffering through the final
stages of this. So…I was going to ask you if you would be willing…to
euthanize me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Kill me. I figured if I found someone that
nobody knew that was a stranger, they could get away with it, and I
wouldn’t have to suffer. I got a gun that is untraceable. And a
silencer. And I thought maybe tonight, I would take a bunch of sleeping
pills, and when I slept you would put a bullet in my head.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll give you fifty thousand dollars in
cash. You’d be doing me a favor. It would be the kindest thing you could
ever do for somebody.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at least take a
little time to think about it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Holy shit, you would do it. You were
literally thinking about doing it!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m an asshole, you were about to kill me.
For fifty grand! That’s not even a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>ipa</strong>: I just got nervous so I was delaying saying
no.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You basically just told me that you were
willing to be a murderer. While you’re cooking me eggs.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s not cool, man. You told me you’re going
to die and you want me to euthanize you. I almost had a heart
attack.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I actually am sick. And I’m not going
to survive.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Don’t do this. My friends do this all the time.
They trick me, and then they trick me again. I’m very gullible. Don’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m not putting you on, man. Just don’t tell
anyone. I mean that. I don’t want people to know about this. I don’t
want to feel weird. Ira nods okay.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Are you religious? Does that give you any
comfort?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do you really think I’m going to sit here
and have a theological conversation with you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe later, Father Mulcahy.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: That’s so sad.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: If it was me, I would tell everyone. Then
everyone would kiss my ass. And take care of me. Tell me how much they
love me.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Wipe my ass when I had to go to the bathroom.
They’d be crying and sad, and that would make me feel really good.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He doesn’t want to be that guy. He picked up
two girls at a bar. Then he had sex with his. And then he came out and
had sex with mine.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: In front of you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: So being terminally ill makes you a
cock-blacker?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No, what I’m saying is…He’s so lost right now
that he’s hiding from the world. And he’s trying to distract himself by
doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women. And he doesn’t want
anyone to know but me.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Why you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Because he doesn’t know me. So he doesn’t give
a shit.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: That’s kind of insulting.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No, I think we had kind of an instant
connection. The other roommate, JAY, walks by.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You fucked him?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Shut up, Jay. Jay keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I feel like he’s crying out for help, and I can
help him. He’s made us so happy in our lives, this is our chance to do
something from him during this time. There’s a lot of wisdom we can take
from this. What he’s going through. We can apply it to our lives.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Like how to bang two chicks in the same night,
even though you have a terminal disease?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No, what is life all about? What is important?
How should we decide to live this precious life? REVEAL that Mark is
crying.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Don’t talk about this shit when we’re high. It
really freaks me out and it makes me sad and it scares me. I don’t want
to talk about this shit.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s why we should talk about it! You can’t
run from it, man. This could make us into better people. This is an
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I don’t want to talk about this shit until I’m
80. I’m 24 years old.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well I’m going to fucking learn something. Mark
cries even more.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: When my grandfather died, we were in a room
with no windows. And they said he was dead. And there was a candle. And
it started flickering like he was blowing it out. But there were no
windows.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: We all thought that was him going to
heaven.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: You have to go through fire to get to heaven?
That wasn’t him going to heaven, that was him going to hell.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Fuck you guys. I was trying to open up. I’ll
never do it again. You’re just being mean because I’m making twenty-five
thousand dollars an episode.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey. You want to see if we can get on-stage
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was thinking about it. I could throw you
some money every week for coming up with new jokes for me. Maybe you can
organize them in the computer, keep track of what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Absolutely. What do you want to pay me? They
close the doors, drive off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll throw you $1500 a week.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Okay, that could work. We can tell that this
amount of money could change Ira’s life.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was thinking maybe you should do some
material about what you’re going through, being sick. There could be
something really powerful, and it would mean a lot to people, that you
would share that with them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m just doing stand-up to have fun, forget
about it on stage. There’s nothing funny about that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It could be classic stuff. For the ages.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fuck classic stuff. Idon’t give a shit what
people think of my shit when I’m dead. Why don’t you wait till you’re
about to die and then you do a bit about it? I’ll bet you’re
about-to-die shit will be funnier than my about-to-die shit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I ordered your Roast Beef. And normally it’s
delicious. But this time I paid a price!</p>
<p><strong>deli manager</strong>: I’m very sorry ma’am. What if you come
in and I give you a free sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well that’s very nice of you. But I have one
question for you. Can I get two sandwiches? George motions for Ira to do
something.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Grandma! Get off the fucking phone. Don’t run
up my fucking bill.</p>
<p><strong>deli manager</strong>: Ma’am! Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is a family matter! He can hit me if he
wants. He’s my grandson, and I love him! Now may I give you my name, so
you have it on file so I can get my free sandwich?
K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U- C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you get that? Can
you say it back to me?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: George? George? He walks through the house,
finds George in bed. For the first time he seems sick.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I had a bad night last night. I was
sweating though the sheets, couldn’t stop. So I got up, watched half of
a season of The Wire and then I slept till…what time is it now?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It’s three in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wanted to get up and do something. But I
don’t think I have it in me. I may just go back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well do you need anything?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I need all sorts of things. But
nothing you can get me. You should go up anyway. You were in a groove
the other night, you don’t want to get rusty.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I. .I. .can’t anyway. I’m doing the late shift
at the deli counter.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really? How long you gonna keep that job
for? I’m paying you good money. What if someone you perform in front of
goes into Ralph’s and sees you cutting turkey?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I know, I just want to be safe, make sure I can
pay my bills. I don’t like to be nervous about that shit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wasn’t like you. I had a different theory.
You’ve got to spend money to make money. Nothing makes you work harder
than being in debt. Maybe we should go buy a Corvette. That’ll make you
try to be funnier.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: so how much notice are you giving me?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Notice? I’m not giving you any notice. I’m just
quitting.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re supposed to give notice. That’s what
people do.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Why would I give you notice? I’m not trying to
stay in Ralph’s good graces. I’m not trying to preserve my good standing
at Ralph’s.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m just quitting. You don’t quit and then keep
working for two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Well I don’t have enough people to cover all
your shifts, now I gotta cover them.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I wish I could help you, but I’ll kill myself
if I keep working here. It’s not what I want to do. Maybe Gail can cover
my shifts.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Gail can’t work weekends, and my kid’s
birthday is this weekend. What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know. Get someone to cover from a
different Ralph’s. There are thousands of them in Southern California.
No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl? I’m not the linchpin that
keeps Ralph’s from falling into chaos.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re an asshole. You always thought you
were slumming it here. Go tell your tucking fart jokes., Get the fuck
out of here before I kick the shit out of you.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You know what? I’m glad you said that, because
I was about to tell you I could work this weekend. What’s your problem?
I didn’t say anything bad about you, I just said I didn’t want to work
for Ralph’s anymore. Chuck takes a step to Ira like he’s going to hit
him. Ira steps back a few feet.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’ll tell Dave. I’ll tell Dave. I tried to do
this politely. The thanks I get.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: See you, Phyllis. You’re nice.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hey, Daisy.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Hey –</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Ira.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was gonna try to hunt down tickets to see
Wilco at the Greek Theatre. You want to come? Are you into them at
all?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: I would love to come. That would be
amazing.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Okay. I’ll call you with the details. Hopefully
I’ll be able to get seats which will not require high-powered
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: I don’t care where the seats are. I just like
to close my eyes and listen to the music at concerts,</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Perfect. Then I can play you their live album
in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats. That
won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That wasn’t funny at all. I’m gonna leave while
I’m ahead right now. She smiles. He walks away.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: George? Ira walks into George’s bedroom. He
hears something, pokes his head in. In the dark, he can barely see
George making phoney calls by himself. Ira listens for awhile, not sure
what to make of this. George doesn’t see him.</p>
<p>****: I was robbed! One second you’re walking down the street with
your Visa card, having a grand old time, and then you’ve got a fucking
gun in your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>visa lady</strong>: What’s the number of the card, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know! The thief has the card, why
don’t you ask the thief the number of the card! George hangs up the
phone. He starts dialing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ah yes, I came into your comedy club tonight
and I was very offended by the performer. I did not pay good money to
have the so- called “comedian” shake my wife’s hand, then smell it and
say, “Did you have fish for dinner?” That is not my idea of
entertainment. Ira leaves the room, feeling like he’s intruded on a
private moment.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was thinking you need to tell someone about
your situation… your condition.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, no. Iâ€¢ don’t want to do that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I feel like maybe you’re holding everything in
and I can understand why you don’t want to deal with it because why
would anyone want to deal with it. But I bet you have a lot of
unfinished business with your friends. Wouldn’t it make you feel a lot
better to get your affairs in order? What do people do at this moment
Don’t they have to do stuff?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t want to do anything. I just want to
be in the moment and live every day the best I can. As soon as I
confront it with everybody, everything’s changed and I can’t get
back.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Everything has changed. At some point you’re
going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around
you. I’m sure there’s a lot of business, estate issues, I don’t know.
Maybe you’ll feel better than if you just deal with everything. Where
are your parents?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: P4y parents would drop dead if I told them
what was happening. They’re in their 80s. They don’t have to go through
this. I’ll make sure they find out at the last possible second.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Friends?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t think I do. I thought I did. I got a
lot of people I know, shoot the shit with, fuck around with. But I
realized when this happened I’m not close to anyone. I had no one to
call. My friendships are Hollywood friendships. When I was lying in bed
I couldn’t think of one person I wanted to share this with. Maybe it’s
me, maybe I never got close to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I think if you talk to people you’d find out a
lot of people care about you. You’re kind of old already, I mean,
compared to me. I’m sure you touched a lot of people’s lives. You can’t
spend the rest of your days making phoney phone calls alone in your
room.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The only reason I did that was because I
couldn’t sleep. And I had no one to call.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well maybe that’s the problem. Maybe if you
told more people you’d have more people to call. You can’t just talk to
me about it, I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about. You’re the
first person I’ve known who’s sick. I’m not good at it.</p>
<p>****: You’ve given me diarrhea, I’m nervous about you and I’m in over
my head.</p>
<p>****: Don’t cry in front of me, man. I can’t start that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Seriously. I can’t…I can’t have you do that.
George really begins to cry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Please don’t do that.</p>
<p>****: I won’t do it, I promise, man. Ira wipes the tears from his
face. New tears immediately come out.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That was first and last time. I’m not even
crying anymore.</p>
<p>****: You’re still crying.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t think I am. I think I’m not anymore.
I’m not sure what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, as long as we got that straight.
George takes a napkin and puts it over his face.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m sorry, George. I really don’t know what to
do, I don’t know how to help you.</p>
<p>****: No, you’re right. I really should tell some people. It just
sucks, man. It just sucks. And they’re going to feel so bad, I don’t
even want to look at them and tell them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’d rather drop dead. of a heart attack and
have someone else make the calls. I have to make those calls? This is a
nightmare. This is a total nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Do you want me to call them, and tell them
what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna say no.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hi, this is Ira, I’m a friend of George’s. He
asked me to call you. His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira
covers the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Will you guys shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck
up! Ira slam the door.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m sorry. I have some news about George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So I left the phone off the hook so he could
hear me doing it.</p>
<p><strong>comedian #1</strong>: That’s very gay.</p>
<p><strong>comedian#2</strong>: No, it was a buddy thing. It was very
heterosexual.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Admit it, you were masturbating.</p>
<p><strong>comedian#2</strong>: Of course I was whacking it. What else
am I gonna do, not whack it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And I kept making her talk and say crazy
shit just to make him laugh.</p>
<p><strong>comedian #2</strong>: I think at one point you said, “Say my
hog is the biggest you’ve ever seen.” And then there is this long
pause.</p>
<p><strong>comedian#3</strong>: That’s a bad sign. If it was big at all
she wouldn’t have paused.</p>
<p><strong>comedian #1</strong>: Remember you used to have that joke
about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked bigger
in their little hands. They all laugh.</p>
<p><strong>comedian #2</strong>: Yeah, you used to get all the girls,
man. Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and sad.</p>
<p><strong>ex-manager</strong>: And I feel horrible about it, but the
truth is, I was having some issues with gambling, and you were doing so
well-and so I took a million dollar check you got in from the studio and
I used it to clear up some debts. And I did it with the intention of
paying you right back before you noticed. But you never noticed, and I
just never got around to paying you back.</p>
<p><strong>covert</strong>: You fucking blew us off. You cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You have to tell mom and dad.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I will tell them, but right at the end. I
don’t want them to go through all this. I can’t put them through
this.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I wish I wasn’t so mad at you. I want to be
there for you, but I am so mad at you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wish I was a better brother.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You weren’t even a brother. You just left when
I was a little kid. You left me there all alone, and you never treated
me like a sister again.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You live so far away. I visited you in
Kansas a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That was six years ago, and you were only
there because you had a concert. My five-year-old has never even met
you. George does not know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And I wanted to bring her, but then I thought
she would just fall in love with you and get attached, and then what? I
didn’t want to do that to her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks a lot, pal. This is everything I
didn’t want to happen. It’s like being at my own funeral.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Afterwards you’ll be happy you did it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: It is such a tucked up situation. Life is
fucked. It makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I really appreciate you coming by.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: This is why I can’t be close with people.
What is the point?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Exactly. Well, I really need to rest…</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: The worst part is at night, when the TV gets
turned off, and it is quiet…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It was so good to see you. George stands up
and exits the room. Ira walks over.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I think George is going to take a nap now.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>bruce springsteen</strong>: You’re about to merge with the
eternal. We’re all going to die. No one gets out of here alive, right?
George nods.</p>
<p><strong>bruce springsteen</strong>: You lived five lives, fucker.
You’re 200 years old in my book. The fun you’ve had, the money, the
adventures, the women you’ve known. Who wouldn’t want to change places
with you right new?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I guess so, but…</p>
<p><strong>bruce springsteen</strong>: You know what? There is no
tomorrow, no yesterday. Only right now, and it’s fucking beautiful.</p>
<p>****: You need to shut the fuck up right now. Have you been browsing
the self-help section at Barnes and Noble? Is this what you say in
between songs these days? I’m going to go right now and delete all your
songs off my iPod.</p>
<p><strong>bruce springsteen</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t know what to
say. I just got nervous.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is awful. Awful. I hate you for having
me do this.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You have to, you have no choice. You’re doing
good. And you’re almost done, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well what are we going to do when it’s over,
when we’re done tomorrow? Because then I’m not talking to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was thinking we should go skiing somewhere.
You’re still physically doing well, and that’s not going to last
forever. You should do something active. Go to Colorado, or Tahoe, or
something. Or do something crazy. Go to Switzerland, or Sweden, or
wherever they have mountains.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t even ski, but you do.
Maybe you should do something like that. Ira notices George is falling
asleep, so he talks more quietly. He’s gotten good at this.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: If it’s too hard, we can just ski for an hour
or two a day, and then get drunk at the bar. You can hit on hot ski
instructors, and then I can masturbate in the room thinking about you
fucking hot ski instructors. He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out
as he speaks.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Whatever. It’ll be fun to be in the mountain
air, fun to look at the mountains. Maybe you shouldn’t even be here. We
can hang out there as long as you want, I got nothing to do. Ira closes
the door.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks for coming down. You didn’t have to
do that, i appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I wanted to, I wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m so sorry. I’m sorry for everything I did
to you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You don’t have to be sorry, that was like 12
years ago. Everything worked out for the best. We see this hurts
George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I screwed everything up. I could have been
married to you now.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We could’ve had a family . I don’t have a
family, I’m all alone here.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry for what’s
happening to you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know, maybe I deserve it. I screwed up
the only good thing that ever happened in my life. I cheated on you. For
no reason at all. Just young and stupid. And selfish. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Maybe I over reacted. I didn’t have to leave
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he
makes coffee.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And the funny thing is…my husband, he is on
the road a lot for business. He did the same thing last year.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Did you leave him?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No. I have kids now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: See, that was my mistake. I should have had
some kids with you before I cheated. she laughs.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You were the one and only magic relationship
in. my life. She starts to cry. He does too. They embrace.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Me too. They cry, forehead to forehead.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: There’s never been anything like you before
or since. I love Chris, but it’s not the same. It’s fine, maybe it isn’t
even fine, but we had something special.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m so sorry. I really loved you. And I do
love you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I love you too George. I wish there was
something I could do.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t set me up for jokes like that. You’re
ruining the moment. She smiles. They hug.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hey. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Good. Mark walks out in a bathrobe.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I thought you were sleeping at
your boyfriend’s again tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I guess it’s been more than ten days.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: It’s been 21 days. I gave you an extra 11.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: What are you guys talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Don’t worry about it, it doesn’t matter, I
don’t give a shit. Leo walks in the front door.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I just fucking killed at the Improv. Bud
Freidman fucking loves me. Leo realizes he’s walked into the middle of
an awkward moment.</p>
<p>****: They said they’re gonna start giving me good spots on the
weekends.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’ve been getting good weekend spots.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Well, that’s because they think if they book
you, George will show up.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What’s with you guys? You both want to fuck my
mother too? What more do you want to do to me tonight? Ira walks
away.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I really did kill. Did you guys just bone, or
something?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I’m getting a little vibe here. It’s getting me
excited.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So now you’re with Mark? You’re his girl?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: I just went out with him one night.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You got a lot accomplished in one night. How
did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: He invited me to a taping of his show and we
hit it off.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Must have been a great episode. I should get a
job on a shitty show so I can use it as foreplay.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: What are you talking about? Don’t treat me
like that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I am not treating you like anything. Do what
you want. I don’t give a shit. I’ll go to Wilco alone.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: What planet are you from? The one where
everyone is perfect like you, you judgemental fuck?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How could you do that? I thought we were going
out on a date.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: We are going on a date. I didn’t plan it. Am
I not allowed to do stuff because we’re going out on a .date? What the
fuck’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I bought tickets to Wilco and I worked all week
to get a reservation at a place that doesn’t normally let people like me
eat there. I just didn’t see this coming. Yes, you’re right. You can do
anything you want. I’m glad this fucking happened, before I wasted the
night with you. I didn’t think you were that kind of person. That you
would sleep with a guy like that.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: He’s your roommate. You don’t like him?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No, I think he’s a pussyhound.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Well, I didn’t know that. Thanks for the
info. I wasn’t trying to hurt you. It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You got excited because he’s the star of the
show. You literally star-fucked.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Yes, you’re right. I’m awful.</p>
<p>****: Give me a break. I don’t even know you.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I told you I was going to give you 10 days.
That was three weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I thought you were joking.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I didn’t know she actually mattered to you. We
talk about girls we want to fuck all the time.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I just bought these two Wilco tickets. Wanna
go?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I would, but I’m going with Tobey Maguire. He
wants me to play his younger brother in some movie.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know, I never got married. I never had
kids. I didn’t get to do a lot of things I thought I would do. But I was
pretty fucking funny, right?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Come on, are you kidding me? We all want to be
you. Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you.
People love your shit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I made a lot of people laugh. I guess
that’s something.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It’s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. I guess so. They watch some more and
we see a really happy, young George getting big laughs with something
really silly.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look at that crazy motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I never understood why people hiked before.
I think I get it now.</p>
<p>****: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m feeling good, so I’m going to the
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You’re not feeling good?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I’m feeling good. It’s kind of weirding
me out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t feel sick at all, and it’s scaring
me. I feel like I’m just going to drop dead. Am I not going to feel bad
at all, and then one day wake up dead? It’s disconcerting.</p>
<p><strong>doctor stevens</strong>: I don’t want to get your hopes up.
We put you on this experimental medication without much optimism, but as
of right now I don’t see any traces of the disease in your blood work. I
don’t want to speak too soon, but we may have beaten this thing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well what the fuck do I do now?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh my god, oh my god! Ira goes to hug George,
but it’s a very awkward moment. Ira really wants a happy hug, but George
is instantly uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. office</strong>: George is sitting at his computer. Ira
is also seated.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I really want to thank you for your help
through this time.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was happy to help.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, you didn’t have to, and you were
really there for me. I was thinking, maybe we should write a movie
together.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I feel like I’ve learned a lot, and I wanna
use this good place I’m in right now to do something really creative. I
would pay you, certainly. I make, you know, about a million dollars to
write a script. I can’t give you half, but maybe one hundred, two
hundred grand, but we’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yeah, we’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I thought a lot about my work when I was
sick and I’m in sort of a strange place career-wise, because I’m
normally the goofy, funny guy and I don’t know if people are expecting a
change from me. And I think people are expecting me to evolve, and it’s
important to evolve before they make a point of asking me why I’m not
evolving.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It’s always good to keep breaking new
ground.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is that something they taught you at the
deli. I’m not asking you for your advice, I just though we could start
trying to come up with an idea.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well, I’m gonna start thinking. And…I’m really
happy for you. Are you freaking out right now?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s very strange. It’s gonna take me a few
days to process it, but it’s a gift and I’m going to treat it that
way.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I learned a lot from being sick and it’s
gonna help me make some good choices, and be a good person from now
on.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: And he thanked me for helping him, and I really
think I was a help during this time. I’m not saying that’s why he got
better, but he definitely had good energy and I hear that helps your
immune system.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He’s going to pay you two hundred thousand
dollars to write a movie script?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know, he said one or two hundred
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: One or two hundred thousand? That’s pretty
vague. That’s a wide range. I’d push him toward two hundred thousand if
I were you.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Thank you for the advice, Bob. That’s very
helpful.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: This is good because now you can help with your
sister’s college tuition.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Your younger sister got accepted to Boston
University but, as you know, your father and I aren’t in the position to
pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So I have to? I just stopped working at a
supermarket two weeks ago. I’m trying to create some financial stability
for myself. The first time I make any real money, I can’t just give it
to her.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well that’s very selfish.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well you guys went on a cruise to Greece last
year. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone, and saved for her college
education.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, so after all we’ve done for you, we can’t
have any fun? We should never take a vacation?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I had to drop out of college after two years
because you couldn’t pay for it. Now I have to pay for hers? Let her
figure it out. Let her get a job.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I didn’t realize I raised such a selfish boy.
When I was young I would have done anything for my family.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Then sell your house. Move into a smaller
house. Use the extra money to pay for her college. Or tell her to work
for a year or two, make some money, then she can pay for her own
college. No one helped me out, I’m just digging out from under now.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t get so high up on your horse with all
your Hollywood friends. I don’t like what you’re turning into.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: One good thing happens to me in my entire life,
and you have to try and take it away and ruin it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I don’t even know where you came from.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t bother showing up for Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving is just for families.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hey George, we’re doing an Orphan’s
Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want to come? It’s just for us losers who
don’t have any family to eat with.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: He’s not gonna email back.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: He’s never gonna want to eat Thanksgiving with
us. The computer BINGS. The guys scream in delight.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Sure. What time? Do you need me to bring
anything? 3 O’clock at my apartment. Bring wine that we can’t afford.
The computer bings.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s pretty much all wine on earth. See you
then.</p>
<p>****: Email back and say: If you can, bring that hot chick from your
last movie. We definitely have room for her.</p>
<p>****: Well, then maybe just bring grain alcohol then. They all start
laughing. The computer BINGS again.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hey Faggots, I know what you’re doing. Stop
emailing me. It’s not amusing anymore. They all start high–fiving.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: He called us faggots!</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: What have you been up to? I haven’t seen you
at the Improv.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’ve just been busy. Will you excuse me? Ira
gets up, walks out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Hey, George. How are you? Come on in. Then Mark
appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on his neck.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Happy Thanksgiving? Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: We’re really glad you could come have
Thanksgiving with us. It’s a big thrill.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s weird, I feel like the old guy in the
room. When I started out I was always the young guy. It’s strange how
fast you become the old guy. And I feel exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Well, you don’t know us, but you’re with
friends and admirers.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know you, I’ve watched your show. “’Nuff
Said.” It’s a good show.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You don’t have to lie to him. He knows it’s not
good.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, it’s good, it’s cute. I like it.</p>
<p>****: I know it’s not that funny, but they do slip in some funny shit
in there every now and again.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t be ashamed, it’s good. But what about
that girl on the show? How old is she? Tell me she’s 25.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: No, she’s 15.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Holy shit! I feel bad. I don’t want to tell
you what I did watching that show. Are you serious? She’s 15?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: No, she’s actually 20.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, good. Now I don’t feel so bad. Their
weird friend, FUTORAN, pipes up.</p>
<p><strong>futoran</strong>: I heard you were sick and now you’re
better. Is that like, really… what’s that like?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s kinda like 9/11. You know after 9/11
you kind of liked everybody? But then it went away. It’s like that.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Did you think you were gonna go to heaven? Did
you count up your sins?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t believe in any of that stuff, but I
was hoping I was headed somewhere. I felt like I was.</p>
<p><strong>futoran</strong>: I think you just wind up in the dirt. Worm
food.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Come on, Futoran, we’re about to eat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, it’s easy to think that way until
you’re headed for the dirt. Then your mind opens up a little bit, you
know? Maybe it’s desperation, or maybe you just start to see more of the
big plan. Luckily I got a little more time before I find out. Daisy pops
her head into the room.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Food’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: May I say the prayer? Everyone nods yes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Everyone hold hands. Thank you for the gifts
this year. Thank you for And thank you for And hopefully next year I’ll
get to screw that girl on Mark’s show. All our dreams will come true.
You guys will get an apartment with less pubic hair on the toilet seat,
you’ll be able to afford a maid. Maybe next year you guys can get a
better celebrity than me. Maybe Wolf Blitzer will come. I also pray that
no one put their balls on this turkey, I’m kind of scared you guys are
about to give me salmonella poisoning. I know this Orphan’s Thanksgiving
it’s just a normal Thanksgiving for you guys, but it’s a very special
one for me. I’m very glad to be here. I’m not that glad to be here with
you, but I thank you for having me. I’m sure it will be very memorable
for you. Now let’s find out what Leo’s balls taste like.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This guy wrote me some funny jokes for that
Mac gig. I asked for some jokes and he sent me about a hundred.
Seriously. This guy sent me jack shit. If you want to succeed you need a
work ethic like Ira over here.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Why wouldn’t I have sent you jokes? You didn’t
ask me for jokes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure I did. I asked you and Ira to write me
jokes and you flaked. Leo’s eyes widen with anger.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ira wrote this joke about Leopard, it was
really funny. Do the joke, Ira.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t want to right now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It was like, what’s great about. Leopard is
you can watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno
all at the same time. This guy’s fucking funny. Leo jumps up suddenly
and walks out of the room without saying anything. Ira watches him go,
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You guys look like a cute couple, you should
go out.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: well, the truth is we had a date, but I went
out with Mark first and he broke it off.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I didn’t expect you to blurt it out like that.
That was very honest of you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If I didn’t go out with every girl one of my
friends slept with… let me put it another way. If none of my friends
went out with girls I went out with, none of them would have gotten
laid.</p>
<p>****: So, are you guys dating now?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: This is making me uncomfortable. The whole
thing, it makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You guys are young, why are you taking
everything so seriously? As someone who’s been through a lot recently,
let me tell you something. The worst thing you can do is hold grudges
and be judgmental. Everyone’s making mistakes, everyone’s screwing up.
You guys are cute together. George points at Mark.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know that Mark’s not good in bed. Don’t
tell me he was a good lay. He can’t have a big dick. Look at Ira. He’s
thick. He’s gotta have a thick dick.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Actually, I have a really skinny vagina, so
I’m not really into thick.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: See? She’s funny. She can take a joke, she’s
not sensitive. I think I’m falling in love with both of you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m gonna walk away now, causing an awkward
moment, that will be followed by a true moment, filled with chemistry.
I’m walking away now. Let the awkwardness begin. George walks out of the
room.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: My brother’s going to freak out that I met
Davey. Did you go to the Wilco show?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I actually scalped them and made a hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Well at last you didn’t lose any money on the
deal.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m sorry I got so upset with you, because it
shows you how much I like you, which is weird because we’ve hardly
spoken. I understand all of that.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Well, attraction is all about smells,
pheromones.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well, you smell right to me. Daisy smiles at
Ira, just as Leo stomps back into the room. He charges right up to Ira,
pissed off.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: You’re a fucking prick, You’re a piece of shit
thief motherfucker. You stole a job from me, you stole my joke.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: You stole his joke?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: He asked for me to write jokes too and you
didn’t tell me!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Uh…yes.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: You .fucker!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I didn’t think you would want to.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Why wouldn’t I want to? What, I don’t like
money? I don’t like private jets?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s just, I needed the gig. And you
are doing so much better than me. I guess I just wanted this for
myself.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: It wasn’t yours to keep for yourself. You lied
to me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I did. And it was fucked up. And I am sorry. I
don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Don’t say anything. Just get your shit, and get
out of the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: You don’t get let off the hook for going into
faggy apology mode. That is a terrible strategy.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I don’t know what the fuck has happened to
you–but my name is on the lease, and I don’t want to live with it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I never told Leo because I wanted the gig?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I didn’t know you were fucking over your
friend. Don’t yell at me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well I fucking live with you now because he
told me to leave.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He kicked you out for that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He said friends don’t lie and I’m fucking with
his career.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well in a way that’s a compliment to me
because he’s so mad he can’t hang out with me that’s he mad at you.
That’s kind of cool. I got you kicked out.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This should be comfortable in here. This
room is almost as big as your old apartment.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Thank you for letting me stay here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No problem. Hey, you want to come talk to me
while I crash?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No. You want to come talk to me while I
crash?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, Charlie. Talk to me. George
closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Terry’s ready for you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was thinking that now might be a good time
for me to make that script “Making Amends.”</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do you really think people want to see you
make a movie about a guy who goes to AA but isn’t really an alcoholic?
He just needs the companionship? That’s a pretty big left turn.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I got money. I want to challenge myself. You
said you liked it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You know, I read it four years ago. I need to
read it again. I don’t remember not liking it. I just can’t tell you the
studio will make it. Your last few movies didn’t do so well.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I thought they did well overseas.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You always do well in Australia, but that’s
about it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What if I do it for no money, just with
back-end?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know if that’s going to cut it
either. The head of the studio does a lot of drinking, I don’t think he
finds that whole area funny. Maybe if you commit to do another one of
the Davey movies, I could tie it to that, so they have to do both.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’vedone four Davey movies.They wantme to do
another sequelto that?We don’t even have ascript.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wellthere’s this great script goingaround
town, Happy Holidays. Whichis about an immature 40 year old man who acts
like a kid. In it he comes home for the holiday season for the first
time in ten years. And havoc ensues. You get to make fun of
Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah and Christmas and New Years. They say they
can turn it into a Davey movie.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Could I at least shoot the Making Amends
movie first?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe I’ll just write something myself.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I wish you would. You’ve never been able to
do it in the past. You always talk a big game about writing your own
shit. But I’ve yet to see a script land on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: See, the thing I was thinking, was…you always
play an immature guy. What if the joke of the movie is you’re incredibly
smart, intellectual and well-mannered. You just go the opposite way with
it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s nothing funny about being smart. All
comedy comes from immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, the Marx
Brothers, WC Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Charlie Chaplin. They
were all immature. They were all knuckleheads. Who wants to see a smart
guy live his life normally? What’s funny about that? What else you
got?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I. .I gotta go through my notes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m thinking about taking a gig, and having
a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well we’ll still write the script, right?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, if we can come up with an idea.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Let’s just keep banging at it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I can’t. I’ve got a date.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You have a date? Who do you have a date
with?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This woman my agent set me up with. She
raises money for this environmental group. I guess she’s like a normal
person. I can’t live here alone in this house forever. I need something
of significance in my life. So I’m gonna go out on some dates. No
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You know what you should do, just as an
experiment? You should try and not fuck her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why would you say that?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Because you’re always saying you don’t know if
women like you for who you are. You don’t know if they like you because
you have money or you’re famous. Why not take some time and get to know
them before ass-raping them. In a romantic way.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s insulting. Don’t take out your
frustrations on me because you can’t get laid by acting like I’m some
sort of deviant. I’m an adult. I have adult sexual relationships. No one
does what they don’t want to do. Sex is how people decide if they like
each other. I’m testing my compatibility by ass-raping them.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: See, you can’t do it. You can’t even entertain
the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with
them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s not true. I’m bored of sex, anyway.
There is literally no body- part/orifice combination I haven’t
experimented with. There is nothing left to do. There is no
nationalities I haven’t.slept with, no age groups I haven’t slept with.
I’m fully ready for normal.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What nationalities have you slept with?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: US. Canada. Mexico. England. France. Spain.
North Korea. Burma. Rwanda. Kenya. Tibet. Serbia. Chechnya. Iran. The
Green Zone. Darfur. The Killing Fields of Cambodia. Mongolia. What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: New Jersey. Do handjobs count? Because then
also California.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know, I haven’t been out on a blind
date, ever. This may be the first one.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh I go out on them all the time. I’ve been
on a bunch of J Dates.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s J Date?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s a website where Jewish people find each
other.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So it’s just a list of all the Jewish
people? I thought we didn’t liked to be tracked and monitored like that.
She looks at him, doesn’t get the joke.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know, because of the… holocaust.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s just a great way for like- minded
people to meet.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What if you don’t like Jews? She just stares
at him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m joking. So, uh, I hear you raise uh
money for an environmental group. That must be very satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It is, because, fixing the environment is
really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and
corporations so they’re forced to observe the environmental statutes
that are already on the books. We also try to put pressure on the
government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their
environmental act. You know, one dilapidated factory in China can
produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one
year.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: See? That’s why I still drive a big truck. I
stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know you’re joking, but it’s a very
serious situation. People like you do a lot of damage to the
environment. Whether it’s taking a private jet by yourself, or getting
driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling
houses. Your carbon footprint is huge.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know what they say about people with a
big carbon footprint? Big dick.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come on. We’re gonna go do a gig tonight. Up
north. And you’re gonna open up for me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How big a theater?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You should have told me so I could have
prepared. I’ve never played a place that big. How long do you want me to
do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can get
there.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Dress nice. Tickets are expensive.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t own anything nice.</p>
<p><strong>the</strong>: Ira is driving George’s Mercedes. George sits
in player. backseat watching “Cloverfield” on a built-in DVD We see
images of different parts of California.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How fucking up north is this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Its near San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So we have like five more hours to drive?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s not that far. It’s like two more
movies.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t like how you made me your limo driver.
It’s weird you’re in the back and I’m up here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’d sit up front but the DVD player is back
here.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I can’t even listen to the radio because you’re
watching the movie. Can I sit back there and you drive?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. I’m near-sighted. I’ll miss the exit. We
Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The monster showed himself.</p>
<p>****: Great.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, you made it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I wouldn’t have missed it for the world,
thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You remember Ira.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hi Ira. Are you performing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m afraid so. I’ve been told if I’m good it
warms the crowd, and if I’m bad it makes them want George more, so…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You look great. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m hanging in there.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I thought a lot about you after I left.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well the show is going to start in a minute,
I better get to my seat. I just wanted to say hi. Don’t be too dirty
tonight, you know that makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now I have no jokes. Ira, you have to do an
hour and half. She laughs.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come by after and give me the review.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay. Break a leg. She exits.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You didn’t tell her that you’re not sick
anymore? Why wouldn’t you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I need you to do something for me. After
your set I gave you a seat right next to her. During the intermission I
want yQ.u to tell her I’m not sick anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Me? Why do you want me to tell her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Because it’s weird, and emotional. I think
she’ll handle it better if it comes from somebody else. And then I can
talk to her about it afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’ll be happy. It’s not weird. You’re the
bearer of good news.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You had to do this to me right before my set.
Like I’m not nervous enough.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so good.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You seem surprised.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t know, you seemed so nervous. But you
were really solid all the way though, and your ending hunk really
murdered.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Thank you. Hopefully George won’t be mad if I
tired the audience out.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t think he has anything to worry about.
They always go crazy for him. Before he got famous, he used to bomb all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And that’s when I think he was the funniest.
And now that everyone knows him, it’s a little too easy for him, I
think. No one was funnier when the audience hated him than George. He
loved it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So you guys were dating right when he started
doing well?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yeah. But you always knew he was gonna do
well. He had so much charisma. He would walk into a room and in ten
minutes that whole room would be about him. Even before anyone knew who
he was.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Where did you meet him?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I was the hat-check girl at the Improv. And I
was acting. I used to do guest spots on all those shows, like Melrose
Place, Beverly Hills 90210. I always played the bitch. I don’t know why,
but I was on the top of the bitch list.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You don’t seem like a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s because I was acting.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Sounds like fun days.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It was, for awhile. Reveal George in the
wings trying to get a look at them from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know if you’ve heard, but it looks like
George’s medicine is working.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ipa</strong>: When George got sick they didn’t think they had
any medicine that would help, so they put him on experimental medicine.
And the last time he went to the doctor they couldn’t detect his blood
disease. They think it might be gone. A moment as Laura takes this
in.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why didn’t George tell me?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He just found out. He doesn’t want to jinx it.
He doesn’t want people to get excited, and then have it come back again.
The lights go down.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen. Here’s the man you
came to see. George Simmons. The place EXPLODES.</p>
<p>****: I thought everyone came to see me. George begins his act. He
could not kill harder. Or look more healthy and charismatic. We can tell
it is all a show for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of
events. The content of George’s act is meant to portray him in a more
positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being sick and the
lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious, and also uplifting way.
All of it is intended to make him look like he has grown up and become
wiser, and someone you could trust and spend your life with.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I really don’t know what to say. It’s not
like you weren’t good before, but your act is so much more
sophisticated, but just as funny. I’ve never seen you speak so honestly
on stage before. You used to say these goofy jokes. It was really
something, you know, and you should be really proud of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks. A lot has happened. And at least I
got some good jokes out of it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well, thanks for inviting me. I’m really glad
I came.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ira and I are driving out of town tomorrow,
I thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out. I want to
see what the ranch looks like, and meet your husband.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: My husband is actually in China for another
week, or so. He spends a lot of time there helping American businesses
break into that market. So you won’t meet him this time, but it would be
great if you came by. That would be fun. I’ll give you the tour.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay. We’ll come by in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay. An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug
goodbye, then hugs George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they
have equal weight.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Bye. I’ll see you then. She looks at Ira. As
she exits–</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You were good too.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow? The
drive is long enough as it is. George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a
thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here’s your money for tonight. Good job.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m excited to see her ranch. I hear it’s
delightful.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Why couldn’t we have gotten two different
rooms?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the fun in that? You can go pay for
your own room, I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So, what happened with you and Laura? You seem
to get along so well. Why did you cheat on her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was young, stupid… and I liked fucking
girls. Why do you think I cheated? You would do it too if anyone would
fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How many times did you cheat on her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Two or three times …a week …for a couple of
years.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It was awful. There was even marriage talk.
My parents didn’t want me to do it because she wasn’t Jewish. She was
taking classes to convert, even. I mean, how cool is that? She was
changing religions to be with me. She knew more about being a Jew than I
did from those classes. She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew, it
sounded so wrong. George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy
accent.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And then one day, somebody told her, I don’t
know who. And that was that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Why do you want to go see her tomorrow? We
could do something productive like get some writing done.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I like her. I love her. I miss her. I just
want to spend a little time with her. I know nothing will come of it. I
just miss being around her. A beat. George starts clicking through Video
On–Demand adult movies.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Anything looking good to you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t want to watch adult movies with
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: okay. You want to watch Juno?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You okay, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, of course I am. Laura opens the
door.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hi? We’ve been waiting for you. Come on
in.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This place is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Thanks. We’ve been here for five years. I
think I just finished decorating it. She leads them through the living
room into a huge open kitchen. On the island, there is freshly squeezed
lemonade, chips and dip. She has over-prepared for their arrival.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Can I live here?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: of course, you can clean the stables.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You have horses?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a real city boy.
But for some reason he loves horses. Of course I’m lef t to take care of
them. But yes, we have three horses.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s crazy, owning a horse. I can’t even keep
a goldfish alive.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, well, we’re ready for the big
tour. I want to see how you live. Suddenly, Laura’s five-year-old
daughter INGRID runs into the room and she’s pissed.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Mom! You said you were coming back! We’re
playing American Idol, you’re ruining the game! Ira is shocked to see
that Laura has a child. This complicates a situation he already thought
was getting too complicated.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’ll come right up. This is my friend,
George. And Ira.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: It’s my turn to sing and you’re supposed to
be the judge and you’re not in there and I’m very angry!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Five. But I turn six very soon.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Really? Because I thought you were like nine,
about to turn ten.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s very pretty. I like your hair.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: I’m so sick of people telling me they like
my hair. George is clearly not that good with kids.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay. I do not like your hair.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Don’t make fun of me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s just joking Ingrid.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: My hair. I have curly hair too. Curly hair is
the best.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Last week my mom straightened it and it
almost went to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: If you straighten my hair, I look crazy. I look
like the killer from No Country for Old Men. Have you seen that movie?
MABLE, Laura’s ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: You guys left me all alone in the playroom!
If you’re gonna leave I’m just gonna go talk on the webcam with
Caroline.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Don’t be rude. This is Ira and George.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Oh, I know you. My mom watches your movies
all the time. But most of them I’m not allowed to see. George smiles at
Ira–Laura’s a little busted.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, really? Do you like them? Which one’s
your favorite?</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t really like the ones
I’m allowed to see, but I think I would like the ones I’m not allowed to
see. But she says I cant’ see them till I’m sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sixteen? Just fast-forward past the bad
parts.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: The whole thing is a bad part. George LAUGHS
in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura. Ira is getting uncomfortable
with the subtext.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: C’mon, let’s finish the game.</p>
<p>****: You’ve got the best of both worlds. Rock it out take it slow.
And then you rock out the show! Everyone applauds for her.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay. Now it’s time to see what the judges
say. I thought you had a lot of energy, you’re clearly gonna make it to
the final four, and I love your outfit. What do you think, Randy?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It was a little
pitchy in places, but I dug it. I really dug it.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: .I’m Simon, and I thought it was horrible. I
don’t how you made it this far in the competition.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I think Paula is drunk. You will never be
American Idol.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to your
sister. Say something nice.</p>
<p>****: You were good.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay, you’re not Simon anymore. Simon, what
did you think?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I agree
with Paula. I think you’re the one to beat. They all applaud. Ira
notices Laura looking at George with admiring eyes that reek of more
than friendship.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay Mable, you’re up. Mable instantly starts
gyrating in a manner that is not appropriate for a ten-year-old and
singing the Fergie song “London Bridge.”</p>
<p>****: I want to go down like London, London.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I told you not to do that. Simon, what do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: She was horrible! She’s a terrible singer!
She’s inappropriate!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay, who’s next? Randy?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I don’t know, Dawg. It was a bad song choice.
I’m not feeling it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My turn. Get ready to be blown away.</p>
<p>****: Take me down to the paradise city. Where the grass is green and
the girls are pretty. Oh, won’t you please take me home.</p>
<p>****: Just an urchin livin’ under the street, I’m a hard case that’s
tough to beat. I’m your charity case so buy me somethin’ to eat. I’ll
pay you at another time! Take it to the end of the line!</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What? It’s Paradise City, by Guns and
Roses.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: You sound like a girl!</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Vote him off!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: All right! Here we go. They start driving
down a path that goes around the edge of the ranch. George has his hands
around Laura’s waist as they drive. Ira looks over, concerned.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Mom! Mom! Laura hits the gas and they
continue the tour.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ira, Laura invited us to stay over for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: But it’s like a seven, eight hour drive home.
If we stay for dinner, we’re not going to get home till like four in the
morning. George stares at Ira for a beat, then –</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll figure it out. You have
something to do in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then everything will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Me and George are gonna go to the supermarket
and buy some food so I can cook dinner. You think you’ll be okay
watching the kids? It’ll only take forty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Sure. I’m great with kids. I was a camp
counselor for five years. Camp Winadu. Kids love me. I’m like a human
teddy bear.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This town is so small and adorable. It’s
like out of a Demi Moore movie.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Clarke’s company is about forty- five minutes
from here. This town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house.
There’s no traffic, there’s one coffee house, one bookstore, one market.
No crime. But after you’ve lived her a few years you hunger for another
coffee shop, a bigger bookstore, and a little crime. It gets so boring.
And it’s such a small town, God forbid you miss one of you kid’s soccer
games, they put the scarlet letter on you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: it can’t be that bad. You live on a pretty
little ranch. You have horses, a duck. It must be a nice life.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: We used to have so much fun. I don’t think I
have that much fun anymore. I don’t like who I’m turning into. Is the
fun over? I have to get up every morning at six, drive my kids to school
and then I have 6 hours before I have to pick them up. I have to yell at
them to do their homework, be a taskmaster, then I make them dinner.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It takes an hour to shower them and put them
to bed. And then it’s 8:30 and I pass out. And it’s great, but tuck. And
when both kids are done with high school I’ll be 49 years old, and then
I’ll have probably 6 very healthy years, then I’ll kind of slow down and
then I’ll be an old woman. And that was it. And it’s great, but
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I couldn’t believe you moved out of LA. You
were getting some good jobs as an actress. You got to play the bitch on
Melrose Place for awhile and make out with Andrew Shue. That was pretty
good. Do you miss it?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes. Being a mom is very fulfilling, but
there are other parts of me and every once in awhile I go a little
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How do you go crazy?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I just get bored and depressed. And you know
how my PMS is kind of out of control. This little boy hit Ingrid in
school, and his mom acted like she didn’t care at all, so I told her to
fuck off. They both laugh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, that must have gotten ugly. How long did
that stay awkward for?</p>
<p>****: Always. That woman hates me. And I hate her. And now our kids
really like each other, so it’s really fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe you weren’t acting on Melrose
Place.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And my husband cheated on me, said he did it
once but I know because I learned from you, they do it once, they do it
all the time. You either cheat or you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: well I don’t anymore. I haven’t cheated on
anybody since you. I haven’t even been in a committed relationship since
you, so it’s impossible for me to have cheated.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s both flattering and deeply
disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I thought a lot about you when I was sick,
and I would do anything for another chance. I know it creates a mess,
but I think it would be worth it. I think we both know it’s what we
should be doing. He kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: We can’t go the supermarket.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Because people will see us.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So? What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well it’ll be weird because we’re about to do
something we shouldn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these
sticks in half and make a chimney.</p>
<p>****: When is George gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: George is gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Why would you say that?</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I heard my mom talking to her friend about it
on the phone and crying.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: I don’t want George to die.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: What do you care? You just met him.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: George is gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: They told me my grandfather wouldn’t die, but
he did.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Here’s the truth. George was really sick.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: But he went to the doctor and they found the
right medicine and now he’s better. And he’s gonna live a long time. The
kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I think my mom’s in love with him. Ira looks
doubly disturbed. He quickly goes back to his popsicle sticks.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Does somebody in your family like sports?
They start passionately making out, slamming into the flatscreens.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I really never thought I was going to see you
again. I grieved for you like you were dead. They continue to kiss.
Suddenly she stops.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then let’s not do it. She stares at him,
trying to figure out what he’s become– is he a good guy or a bad
guy?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I gotta get back to the kids.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You’re back. That was quick.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The town is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Where are the groceries?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: We decided ordering in might be a little more
fun.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Food’s here! All right, everybody. Let’s sit
down at the kitchen table. Everyone gets up and heads toward the
kitchen. Laura opens the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A
handsome man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It’s CLARKS,
Laura’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you doing
home?</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: The man I was supposed to have a meeting
with had a heart attack, if you can believe that. So I decided to try
and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings. George
appears behind Laura, not knowing what he’s getting himself into.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, Clarke. George had a performance last
night in town, which I went to, and him and his opening act, Ira, came
by to say hello on their way out of town. There is an awkward moment,
then Clarke smiles and gives George a compassionate look, the type of
look you give a man you think is dying.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: It is really nice to meet you, George. Laura
talks about you all the time, and we’re obviously big fans of your
movies.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, thank you. You’ve got a great family
and a great home.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m so glad you’re home, honey. Laura gives
Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What’s taking so long with the pizza? Before
anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears in the
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>pizza delivery guy</strong>: Hi. That’ll be twenty-eight
forty- seven, please.</p>
<p>****: This is really great pizza. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It tastes just like New York pizza, which is so
surprising because you can’t get good pizza in Los Angeles, so you
wouldn’t think you could get it in Northern California. But this really
tastes like New York pizza. A long pause.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sounds like your business is going very
well.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: People never thought China would do this
much business with us, you know, but it didn’t seem like a risky
proposition for me. They’ve got a billion people, we make all kinds of
cool shit in America, they start finding out about it on the internet
and what-not. Sooner or later they’re gonna find a way to get our
shit.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He speaks Chinese. For real. Ingrid yells at
something in Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You don’t think they want new mobile phones?
A new X-box? I’m trying to get access into North Korea, no shit. That
situation could chance overnight. That is a huge market waiting to be
tapped. It’s already starting in Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: My friend backpacked across China and he caught
some sort of virus or something from what he ate. He was sickforweeks.
He still has it. It’sthekind of thing you can’t getridof, you have it
for the restofyour life, but it stays dormant.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: So, George. How are you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh…I’m hanging in there.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s doing really well. He’s been very
strong.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: It’s a terrible situation. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s been fighting the good fight. His
doctors are taking very good care of him. Ira can believe this
conversation is happening.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You’re a tougher man than me. I don’t know
how I could go about my day with that hanging over my head.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It just makes you appreciate every moment.
It brings things into focus, you suddenly realize what’s important in
life.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Does anybody want seconds? Or should I bring
out the desert?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’d love desert. What do you have? Do you have
any ice cream or cake, or anything like that? I have a real big sweet
tooth right now. Why don’t we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream
bar with kids right now? I’ve got a better idea, I make a really good
milkshake. We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in
the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. living room</strong>: Empty milkshakes litter the coffee
table.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Do you know who might be able to help you? A
Chinese doctor. Have you explored Eastern medicine at all?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Now’s not the time to talk about this.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: I’m trying to help the man.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Hey. I’m the last guy who would buy into
that shit, but it works.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He really is the last guy who would buy into
that shit.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Our country’s only two hundred years old.
The Chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit
out. How I got into it, I had acid ref lux and nothing was working and
then this guy at work turned me onto a Chinese doctor and he gave me
some herbs that tasted like dogshit, but they worked.</p>
<p>****: I take herbs for my PMS. They really helped.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Daddy, you’ve been cursing a lot. You owe me
a dollar for every curse. I think you owe me fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: This conversation is scaring me. I don’t
want George to die.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You girls can go play in the other room. The
Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health. They don’t
think doctors should attack the diseases in the body, they’re all about
trying to support the body and make it stronger, so the body can fight
off the disease. It works. I’ve seen it. I wish I could find a way to
mass-market Chinese medicine in this country. Someone’s gonna do it and
make a fuck-load of money. Because these people get old, really old. You
can’t kill these people.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Either that or they’re all young and they just
look like shit. Clarke laughs.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: This guy’s funny. You should be opening up
for this guy. Hey, who wants a drink?</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: I’m going to retire in seven years. I’m
done. I’m playing golf for the next fifty years. Work hard now, then get
out. That’s my plan. I’m putting in the time. Then I’m getting the fuck
out. I don’t like working. I will do it. I like what it gets me. But I
don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You ever see Laura act? She was quite an
actress in her day.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: George, stop.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: That’s what I hear. Can’t say I watched that
much ‘Melrose Place’ back in the day. She keeps telling me to watch the
videos but, you know, I was never a big ‘Party of Five’ fan.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well, I also ran a theatre company. And it
was down to me and Cameron Diaz for ‘The Mask.’ I sacrificed a lot for
our family.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Okay, if you say so. The Mask was a funny
fucking movie. You know what other movie Cameron Diaz was great in?
‘There’s Something About Mary.’ Laura looks livid at her husband’s
insensitivity and disrespect. They keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: I love walking it off after a big meal.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s beautiful here at night.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: There’s no pollution here like in LA so you
can actually see the stars.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: They are beautiful, but we have to get going.
We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You can’t leave now, you won’t get back
until daylight. You should crash in the guest house. I’m sure it not as
fancy pants as where you live, George, but it’s better than driving all
night or crashing at a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: And if you want to hang out tomorrow I just
installed six flatscreens, we can watch all the football games we want.
And dog- racing from Florida. There’s a big game tomorrow. Ira, you must
have played some ball in your day.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No, I’m just big-boned.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We probably should get some rest before the
drive. All right, show us to our quarters, sir.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Ira, he never wakes up.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You sure you can’t stay?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: We really do need to get back. I have to visit
my mom. I can’t miss it. It’s her birthday. Everyone in my family is
coming in from across the country for it. She’s turning 65. It’s very
important we get back for it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s too bad, I wish you could stay.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: I wish I could say I was gonna see you
again, but I can’t say that. His eyes start to mist up.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Clarke, don’t. You don’t need to do that.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You know what? I think I do need to do that.
One thing I learned in China from some Buddhist friends of mine is it’s
important to have an open heart, to live in the moment, and to speak the
truth to each other. So I’d like to say to you, George, that it was a
great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wife’s
life. I really like you. And wish we had more time to get to know each
other. And I wish you a peaceful end to your journey. And another great
journey on the other side of it. Clarke hugs George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I really don’t know what to say. I re- ally
don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That was beautiful, honey. Well let me walk
them to the car. Ingrid walks over.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Don’t be sad. Ira told us that his medicine
is working and he’s not sick anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I think that was a secret. I don’t think you
were supposed to say that.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Mable, take Ingrid into the house.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Can we watch another SpongeBob movie?
Atlantis.Squarepantis?</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Yes. Go into the house and watch a movie
now! Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: What the fuck is going on around here? Is
that true?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I never said that he was still sick. He just
took some medicine and it’s looking better. You can’t detect it in his
blood, but it could come back.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Is it looking better? Or is he better? Is he
sick anymore?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well …I don’t how you define these things-I’m
not… sure.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: is something going on here? Are you getting
your revenge on me while I’m away? I came clean with you, you can’t come
clean with me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You know what? I don’t know what I want
now.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh shit. It’s ON.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: So this is what you want? Was he ever sick
in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He was sick. He was very sick.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Because if this is what you want, I’ll leave
right now. I’m not going to play these games. I’m happy to leave. I’m
not gonnna have you put me on the cross because I made some mistakes.
You guys enjoy each other. I could give a fuck. If you need me, I’ll be
at my apartment in China. Clarke leaves.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What the fuck is going on? Did you guys do
something?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We had sex in Clarke’s office.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Because I love her. She’s the best thing
that’s ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: But she has two kids, she’s married.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s miserable. He cheated on her.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You cheated on her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, but that was a long time ago. I’ve
changed. You saw that douche bag. You don’t think he’s fucking geishas
on every business trip?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He was trying to cure you with herbs. He seems
like a great guy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is none of your fucking business. Just
stay out of it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I can’t stay out of it. We took your car here.
I have no way of leaving.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This shit is deeper than you understand.
People get divorced. People make mistakes and then they fix them. That’s
how life works. It’s not a big deal. I know you’re still sad because
your parents got divorced. Well get the fuck over it. Call a fucking cab
and go home.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So what are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re gonna sleep in Clarke’s office. I’m
gonna go talk to Laura.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: On, there you are. I’ve been looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’ve been going through all the bank
statements, trying to figure out which are in his name and which are in
mine.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Almost all the accounts are in his name. I
wonder if he did that on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you smoking a joint?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yeah. My best friend Nancy grows this stuff
on a hill by her house. You want some?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, that stuff makes me paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Not me. It makes me feel sharper, Some people
get tired, I get more energy, more clear.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What’s happening? Whatever we want to happen
is gonna happen now. I’m free. I’m fucking free. Laura gets up, kisses
him.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: We’re free.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, we’re free. They start kissing again. She starts to moan
loudly.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not so loud, your kids are sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: A tank could roll through this place, it
wouldn’t wake them up. They kiss some more. She moans louder.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hey, Daisy. It’s Ira.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Oh. Ira. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I just wanted to talk to you because I’m in the
middle of a terrible situation and I don’t have anyone I can talk about
it with. My friends are all mad at me and George is kind of losing his
mind.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: You can tell me, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Look, I know you think I have the moral code of
some guy from the 50s like Dwight Eisenhower, but I’m with George and
he’s hitting on his ex-girlfriend who’s married now and has kids and I
don’t know what to do. I’m kind of freaking out. I think I’m having a
panic attack.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Well don’t have a panic attack, that’s not
going to help anything.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well telling me to not have a panic attack is
not going to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Haha, very funny.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Seriously, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well I guess they dated like ten years ago…</p>
<p>****: Jesus Christ, what time is it already?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It’s 10:15 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh my god. Really? I mean, this is fun, but
I don’t know how much I can take. Hopefully they’ll take a nap at some
point. I want to take a nap.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: They don’t look that tired. The kids are
yelling and screaming and clearly have eight more hours in them.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Look what I did. I want this hung up on the
wall. She shows them the picture, which is clearly not appropriate for
the wall: a picture of herself choking and dying.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: The food here made me sick.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Mama, I have to go to the bathroom. Come
wipe my butt.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I have to talk to them for a minute. Mable,
go wipe your sister’s butt.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: She can do it. She’s almost six. That’s
weird. Ingrid and Mable walk off together.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I wet the bed til I was eleven. It wasn’t even
a mental thing. I just got relaxed when I was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I spoke to Clarke. He’s going to fly back to
China tonight. I was thinking about driving to the airport and meeting
him there and telling him that when he comes back, he should find
another place to live.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s great. Are you okay doing that?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes. It’s what I want. I just need to figure
out when we would move down to LA. It might be better to let the kids
finish out the school year because I have to apply to the private
schools in LA, and I don’t know if I missed the deadline. Then I’d have
to look into the charter schools. Sometimes these private schools, if
you give them a donation, they let your kids in. Maybe you can stay up
here for part of the year if I can’t make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure. If I’m not shooting a movie, or on
tour or something, that would be great. Laura leans in and kisses
George. George is not big on public displays of affection. He kisses
back, but you can tell that he’s very uncomfortable. They hear the kids
headed back to the table and quickly separate.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I made her wipe her own butt.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: I did it, but I don’t know if I did a good
job. Look at what I drew. I drew a picture of you. Look? Show Mama.
George holds it up. It is a picture of several people.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: That’s you. That’s George. That’s Mommy. And
Daddy. And me. And Mable. That’s all of us. We see the picture, and it
is everybody holding hands.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is a small bookstore. They’ve only got
one Philip Roth book. Didn’t he write like fifty books?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So when are we going to go home? You’re not
talking at all about when we’re going to go home.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s going to talk to Clarke tonight, and
then she’s going to make a plan. We’ve got to get over that hurdle.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Are you okay with everything? This is happening
pretty fast.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I mean, she’s cool, right?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: She’s nice. I don’t really know her very
well.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She was kind of cooler when I knew her back
in the day. She’s still hot, but she was crazy hot back then. Her
attitude has changed a bit. With the kids and all. Back then she was
really sexy, and all about fucking. I know she’s busy with her life now,
but it is a little different.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yeah, well when you have two kids and a
husband, and horses and ducks, it’s not all about fucking.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s just the hormones of youth. I’m all
about fucking. But I don’t expect to be when I get older. I’ll be
occasionally about fucking, which is normal. The fact that you’re all
about fucking now is the weird thing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well hopefully everything will work out. If
it doesn’t, it just wasn’t meant to be.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It means I’m going to give it a shot. I’m
excited, but I’m not going to really know if it works until we’re in it.
I hope I’m just not in love with the person she used to be.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: She’s about to leave her husband for good. She
has two kids. You’re not sure this is going to work?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s no way to ever be sure that
anything’s going to work! I couldn’t live up here. She wants me to live
up here. I don’t think I can do it. Maybe a couple of weeks a year.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well, she’ll live with you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do you think she means that she’s going to
bring the kids too?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Of course. What else would she do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know, don’t some men get custody of
the kids? Or they split the custody? I like the kids, but I’ve never
lived with kids before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The young one’s kind of cute, but I don’t
think I can stand the old one full time. There’s too much going on
there. But I could definitely tolerate the young one. She’s cute. Maybe
they can split kids. Maybe Clarke will take the annoying one. Ira just
stares at him, not sure what to do.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’ll be back in an hour and a half, tops. And
then it all begins.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, call me if you need any backup.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I.. . love you. The car drives off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, I’m going to go into the other room
and watch some TV.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You don’t want to hang with the kids?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nah, I was going to watch four hockey games
at once. I’ve never done that.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: okay, but I’ve got to run out and grab some
cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But you don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I never smoked in front of you because you were
sick. But I do.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Holy shit, holy shit. Where’s the fucking
airport around here? Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation
system in a panic. He can’t make it work.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: George! Help! George jumps up and runs to
her. She is in the bathroom sitting on the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Can you wipe my butt?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t you know how to do it?</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: I don’t do it good.</p>
<p>****: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: How do you get to the fucking airport?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where are you, where are you? You have to
come back here. I need your help. I don’t know how to do this. He walks
back to where the kids are. They are watching tv. All around the room
are family pictures. He is beginning to feel bad about what is
happening.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I think my mom and dad are getting a divorce.
I don’t want my parents to get divorced. All my friends’ parents are
divorced, and they’re not happy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why would you say that?</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: I heard my mom talking to her friend. I
listened through the wall. She was looking for a lawyer. He cheated on
her. What does cheating mean? That he’s going to marry someone else? Why
don’t they just try harder?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Laura, it’s George. Come back to the house.
Maybe you shouldn’t do it. Maybe it’s too early for this. Call the
house.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m getting cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ve been gone for forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I got lost. I don’t know this town.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well come back. I don’t know how to take
care of these kids, I’m not a camp counselor like you. These kids are on
to me. The older one’s too intense. She’s troubled. She’s like Damien,
from the Omen. I need help.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Ok, I’ll hurry back.</p>
<p><strong>clarks</strong>: I’m so sorry. This only happened because of
me. It’s all my fault. I made you feel terrible. I made you feel unsafe
in our relationship. I’m so sorry. Please forgive me. Ira stands there,
staring at them.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m sorry too. I love you so much. It was
just a flirtation. It never went anywhere. It’s just after you cheated
on me, I felt so alone. And you were gone so often that I felt like our
life doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Then I have to make a change. I’ll stop most
of the traveling. There’s nothing more important than you and the kids.
Ira starts to turn to sneak away. Clarke sees him.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Ira! What’s going on? What are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh, I’m just headed back to Los Angeles. I’ve
got some spots at the Improv I’ve got to do this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You’re headed back to Los Angeles? Then why
are you at the International terminal?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: This is the International terminal? I’m so
confused, I’ve never been to this airport before.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Yeah, this is the Air China First Class
Lounge. REVEAL that everyone else in the lounge is Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: What the fuck is going on? What the fuck is
going on, Laura?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Tel- me the truth ! Just tell me the
tri.t_h.;_</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I came here to tell you that I wanted you to
move out when you came home. But I realized this was a mistake, so I
didn’t say it. Please don’t hold that against me. We’ve worked
everything out. Everything is fine.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Who’s watching the kids? Who’s watching the
fucking kids?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: An adult is watching them.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Is George watching our fucking kids? I will
kill him. Clarke runs off.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my
life! You and George have to get the fuck out of my life. You are
ruining everything!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Uh oh. Ira runs out of the lounge. Laura runs
out also.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No, no, no! I’m here. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: George! Clarke is coming back to the house. He
knows everything! I’m coming to get you. Be at the end of the driveway.
No! Be at the next driveway over! To the north!</p>
<p>****: Can you take it into the family fun room?</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: Are you two going to fight?</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Ye s.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s not happy. Clarke punches George in
the face then kicks him martial arts style.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: No one who’s married is fucking happy. Leave
us alone! You fucked up. You fucked it up with her a long time ago. Let
it go or I will kill you. I will literally kill you till you’re fucking
dead. That disease didn’t kill you. But I will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You shouldn’t joke about my disease. That
was very serious. Very scary. Clarke punches him several times, but they
are more like martial arts hits.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the hell is that? Ira arrives. George
starts yelling at Ira.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t jump in. Whatever you do, don’t jump
in. I don’t want your help!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You said you were getting cigarettes then
you ran to the airport to stop her. What kind of friend are you?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I am a good friend because this entire
situation is crazy. You are out of control.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I didn’t deserve what you did to me. You
betrayed me !</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: When I got there, she was already kissing him.
I never even had a chance to stop it. I didn’t get to do anything!</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Don’t pretend you’re fucking mad at each
other, just to distract me so I won’t beat your ass. Clarke pushes
George.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You’re gonna come to my house? You’re gonna
come to my fucking house? You have to get your own life. Leave us the
fuck alone.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t hit me! I’ve been sick! They don’t
know. The medicine is working now, but I’m still sick. Clarke punches
George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What are you doing? I said to jump in!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You told me not to jump in.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s what “don’t jump in” means. It means
“jump in.” Help me! Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks
him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re a terrible fighter.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I know, that’s why I became a comedian, because
everyone used to beat me up! George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the
head hard, sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and
Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet. Laura runs into the
middle of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Laura, tell Clarke to stop!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Clarke, please don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Don’t tell me what I can and can not do.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Laura, tell him. Tell him you want to be
with me now. Laura doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Laura?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why did you have to come here and confuse me?
Everything was fine before you came here. Now everything is all screwed
up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Laura, what’s it going to be? Are you going
with him, or are you going with me? Laura looks at Clarke.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: With him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You fucked up my life. And now I fucked up
yours. But just a little. Probably just for a day. She walks back into
the house.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Hit the road before I put you through
another round.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You cheated on her too!</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Yeah, but we’re married. We’re going to work
through this shit. You should have waited until you were married to
cheat. It buys you another chance. Clarke punches George. Ira is on the
ground. He doesn’t get up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She told me I was the love of her life. And
she loves me more than she loves you!</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: When she said that, did she think you were
dying?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Too bad you had to ’Live and find out it
wasn’t true. Leave my fucking family alone! Clarke punches him. George
gets a punch in but it doesn’t hurt Clarke. Clarke punches him
again.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: I can do this all night.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Stop Ira, you’re hitting me too. Mable and
Ingrid appear outside.</p>
<p><strong>mable</strong>: What are you guys doing?</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: What’s happening? The three look at the kids
and instantly feel awful.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: We’re just playing that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’re wrestling. It’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>clarks</strong>: Boys like to wrestle just like girls. They
all start wrestling some more, but this time it is fake playful. They
give each other noogies, and tickle each other so the kids won’t be
scared. A little blood runs off of George’s face.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid</strong>: Are you bleeding?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. We were just painting. I got some paint
on my cheek.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: Come on girls. Let’s go inside. Mable and
Ingrid run inside. Clarke turns to George.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: You know what sucks about this? I like your
movies and now I can’t watch them anymore. Clarke walks away, then walks
back.</p>
<p><strong>clarke</strong>: I’m sorry. That was mean. Through ail of
this, I want you to know something. I’m glad that you’re not sick, and I
understand. And I forgive you. Clarke goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That was meaner than him punching you. That is
a demented motherfucker. George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back
two punches at George’s face and he stumbles back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: None of you fuckers can hurt me. George
pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the ground for a moment.
Ira makes his-way free and gets up.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Get the hell off of me you psycho.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Drive me home.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How are you gonna get home then?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You are the most self involved person I have
ever met.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: No matter what the situation, no matter how
many laughs or how many women you get you will never be happy. You’re
always going to be miserable. You are a bottomless pit. A bottomless
wound.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What about you? You are just a lackey. Who
are you to judge me? You tried to screw me over, after all I. have done
for you.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I am not responsible for you. You wanted me to
sit back and destroy this woman’s life? Help you cheat on her? You put
me in a terrible position. I don’t give a fuck, go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lacky.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You made me the tacky? I’m not a lacky, it’s a
job.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s not a job, you’re a tacky. You’re not
even that fucking funny. This gets Ira very mad.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Who cares? If being funny means being like you,
I rather be a little less funny.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: You’re the only person I know who learned
nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All
it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad
to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna
die.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m not going anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Everything is about you. You don’t even know
where I live. You’ve never asked me one question about my life. How much
can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about
anything!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You’re
not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in
the door.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Fuck your money. Fuck you. This has all been a
huge mistake.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wake me when we get home. George climbs in
the back seat and tries to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: okay, I’m getting out. You have to drive
yourself home. I’m getting out here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why didn’t you drive me to my house?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Because then I’d still have your car.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ll drop it off later.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: There is no later! I’m not going to ever talk
to you again. So I don’t want your car.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So that’s how it’s going to be.</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: You know, when you’ve got a big family,
and you’ve got a lot of clutter…</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: We rented out your room to Jay. But you can
crash on the couch if you want.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch.</p>
<p><strong>jonah</strong>: I fucking didn’t cum on the couch. Just sleep
on it for a month, and then we’ll find some excuse to boot Jay out.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Thanks. I’m sorry, I lost my way for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>i ha</strong>: That was great. She kisses him.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Thanks. The MANAGER walks over.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hey Ira, Federman got in a car accident. Do
you want to take his spot? George walks over with a young comedian of
about Ira’s age. This young man has clearly taken his place.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Hey George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is Randy. He’s funny, you’d like his
stuff. It’s smart.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m sure I would. I look forward to seeing it.
Are you going on tonight?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Do you want to go up? Ira was gonna take
Federman’s spot, but we can get you up if you want to?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, that’s ok. I don’t want to take Ira’s
spot. I’m just gonna hang out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>angle on george</strong>: He watches from the back of the
room. At first he does not laugh, but then slowly starts laughing–but
more at the things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is
proud of Ira and misses him.</p>
<p><strong>female customer</strong>: Is the potato salad fresh?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I made it myself this morning.</p>
<p><strong>female customer</strong>: Is it good?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I stake my reputation on it.</p>
<p><strong>female customer</strong>: Okay. Give me a quart.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would like a
quarf’of potato salad. The woman moves to the other side of the counter.
We reveal George standing there, holding his ticket.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do you have any turkey that’s
hormone-free?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yes we do.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So this is where you work.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Back in the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I thought we were writing a screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Well, you’re not a very good writing
partner.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Or any kind of partner. You want to make me
a turkey sandwich and talk to me? They give you breaks around here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In my travels, I have learned a lot about
Asia and Buddhism. And I would like to be in the moment now with you,
and to tell you how sorry I am, and how much I have appreciated your
friendship. And even if we are not friends in the future, I wish you
well on your journey. Ira laughs.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That guy was a douche-bag.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But also kind of cool. It’s a very weird
combination.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: He was going to heal you with those herbs, man.
You get sick again, you should call that guy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think most of what you said to me was
true. And I really am sorry. I think I’m still not very healthy…in my
brain.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: It’s all right, man. You’ve been through a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I appreciate you trying to help me.
Even though it was kind of an impossible task.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Is everything going okay? How are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I am not doing well, but things have
certainly been worse. So, I will be fine.</p>
<p>****: You were good the other night. I hear you’re getting regular
spots now.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m actually going up tonight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really? Any new jokes you’re working on?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Yeah, I’ve been trying to get off my ass and do
some writing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you got? Ira is surprised to hear
him ask this, since he has never asked this before.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was thinking about doing a bit about how I’m
not very good looking, but I’m not bad looking, but I’m just
good-looking enough that if I had a good personality, it might put me
over the top.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You should do something about how, when you
date a girl, and you feel really good and she likes you, and then you
see pictures of all her ex- boyfriends, and they’re all really
goofy-looking guys, and it’s not that you’re good looking, it’s just
that in this psychotic girl’s eyes, you’re good looking?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: And how all of her boyfriends look like Lou
Costello.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why don’t you say Dom Deluise? it’s a more
current reference.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: More current? What year was Cannonball Run,
1978?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, okay. What else you got?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I was going to talk about how I haven’t had sex
in so long, that I can’t even remember my previous sexual experiences so
I can masturbate to them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You should say, now when I masturbate, I
have to think about the last time I masturbated.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: That’s a good one. You can write.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know, I always wanted to be part of the
comedy field. As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira
jokes for his act, the first selfless act we’ve seen him commit in the
entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we…</p>
