<p><strong>music explodes</strong>: WAGNER’S “GOTTERDAMMERUNG”</p>
<p><strong>olaf</strong>: Leif, let’s do the deed before another night
falls. The crew’s near mutiny.</p>
<p><strong>leif ericson</strong>: Know this! The first man to turn will
taste my steel in his guts.</p>
<p><strong>olaf</strong>: But we’ve surely gone far enough.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: That accursed box must be thrown off the
edge of the world. We will go until we can go no more…</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: …Land ho.</p>
<p>****: By Odin’s beard…</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Be quick, Witch. Let the deed be done.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief dwell now
in waters, base and bland. And in waves and sand thy magic forever
sleep…</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: look about fearfully.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Back to the ship men, hurry.</p>
<p><strong>olaf</strong>: Captain, you’ve discovered a new world. It is
your right to name it.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Leave that to the Italians. We’re never
coming back here. Never. This land is now cursed.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: Yessiree, it’s a four-alarm sizzler out there
today with highs in the upper nineties and no relief in sight. We have a
third stage smog advisory and a metro traffic gridlock alert.
Flourocarbons are up, the Dow Jones is down and we’re expecting another
Spike Lee movie any second. In other words folks, it’s just another
bee-youtiful day in Edge City.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Look at those clouds rollin’ in, man.
Freaky weather.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey Charlie, can you go over these stats?
We’re supposed to have a complete report before lunch.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had my weave
tightened and my head is killing me. Be a pal and take those over to
Hinkleman, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hi guys. Did you have any luck with those
concert tickets Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I sure did. Friday night, just like you
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Oh, Stanley, that’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What time should I pick you up?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Gee, I don’t know. My best girlfriend just
got into town and I know she’d love to go. Can we get an extra ticket
for her?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well… uh, actually it’s sold out. I was
kinda lucky to get these.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: She’s only going to be in town a couple of
days and I just can’t let her sit at home all alone. Are you sure there
isn’t something we can do?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know what? Here. You two go.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Oh Stanley, I couldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No really. Go ahead. It’s okay. I hate
concerts anyway. All that, you know… music floating around.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That is so sweet. Sheila’s just going to
love this.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So maybe you and I can get together over
the weekend?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m not sure what’s going on, but just give
me a call. You know I like to be spontaneous.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, sure. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest guy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The kiss of death. As soon as they use the
“N” word it’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So maybe I am a nice guy. So what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You are a rug. I am talking astro-turf
here. You’re letting these women sharpen their cleats on you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey, I’m a gentleman. If they can’t
appreciate that, it’s their problem.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You spend too much time being “nice” to a
girl, you’ll wind up sittin’ around listening to her complain about the
son of a bitch she really loves.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Charlie, you are a very sick puppy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wake up, Stanley! These are the nineties.
We’re dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies.
You can’t romance ’em. You gotta confuse ’em. It’s the only thing that
gets their attention.</p>
<p>****: Let me demonstrate. You see that girl over there?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hi Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, hi…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s right. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my
friend over there and I were having this discusion and I thought maybe
you could settle it for us.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll help out if I can.</p>
<p>****: Actually, I don’t know… this is kind of a personal
question.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s okay. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if
I wasn’t a happily married man… am I the kind of guy you’d go out
with?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, um… I don’t know.</p>
<p>****: Well… yeah. I guess I would.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Lisa, I have terrific news for you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m not married! Is this perfect or what?
Listen, there’s not a lot of women willing to come right out like that
and admit they’re attracted to a guy, but…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jeez… make up your mind.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay. Bad example. Some of these women got
so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap. I’ll tell you what
Stanley, tonight I’m gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the
darkest heart of the urban jungle.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The Monkey’s Paw. Hottest new club in town.
It’s a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So how are we gonna get in?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Woah, do I detect a little self-image
problem there, buddy? You just leave everything to me. This, my friend
is going to be the perfect night on the town.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hold the phone. Killer at three
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh my god… A perfect dime. The dame of
dames. The Moby of my dick.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Easy Charlie. You’ll sprain your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Excuse me, where can I open a new account?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’ve come to the right place, ma’am. Just
step right this way and pull up a chair…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m a complete wreck. Will you
hold this please?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Here, let me take that for you.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So, uh, what kind of account did you have
in mind?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Well, I’m not sure exactly. I’m just terrible
with things like that. That’s an interesting tie Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The, uh… pleasure’s all mine.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: May I? I’m such a mess.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh… of course.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: As I was saying about that tie. It’s like one
of those, what do you call them, ink blot tests.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A Rorschach test.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: That’s it. It looks like… um. A young woman
riding bareback. You know, like a Lady Godiva or something.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Really? I don’t think I can…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Or… if that’s not a horse it could be two
lovers. A man and a woman. That would be the woman on top, of
course.</p>
<p>****: …Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t know. …Bold colors. It’s a power
tie, y’know? They’re supposed to make you feel… powerful.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Does it work?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sort of. It’s just a tie. Now, about that
account.</p>
<p><strong>inner</strong>: sanctum; an eclectic post-modern playroom
with an array of electronic toys and minimalist gun racks.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: That’s it sweetheart. A little to the
right.</p>
<p><strong>their</strong>: shoulder holsters.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Hey, will you guys keep it down back
there?</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: That’s cool, man. Freeze it right
there.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: What do you think, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Layout’s not bad. We got us a sweet
little Perkins/Jenning time lock. But them motion detectors are putting
the chill on my thrill.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Can you pull it off?</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Hey, you’re talkin’ with the Doctah,
man. It’s all about time and money.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Yeah, well the meter’s runnin’ on this one.
We got less than a week.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Not cool. What about the coin?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: There’s plenty. And I’ll be happy to invest
your share.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: What you talkin’ about, man?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: This isn’t about the lousy couple hundred
thou’ that’s sitting in that vault, Freeze. That’s chump change.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Yeah? Then I’m chump number one,
man.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: We gotta expand your horizons Doctor. Take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: The Valhalla Casino. Twenty mil of glass,
neon, booze and dice. World class sucker bait. The grand opening is
Saturday night and it will drive this two bit club of mine out of
existence. But I say if you can’t beat ’em, take ’em over.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Yeah? That’s Arnie the Swede’s place,
man and he is one ice cold meatball eatin’ motha fucker.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Leave him to me. You pull off this heist and
I promise you, it’ll be all tits and champagne from here on in.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hold it up right here, please.</p>
<p><strong>bullet</strong>: riddled partition as the cab continues to
barrel through traffic.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hold up?! No hold up! I keel you very well!
I splatter your guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No! No! He only wants you to stop the
cab!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hokay. Pardon you very much.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s alright, Stanley.</p>
<p>****: I hate this town. I really hate this town.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why are you getting out here?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I gotta pick up my car.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Fine. Now don’t forget. Ten o’clock at the
Monkey’s Paw. I’ve already got us lined up with a couple of authentic
dimes.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Charlie, please. The last time you said
that you showed up with two lesbian mud-wrestlers.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, I can’t promise we’ll get that lucky
again… Later!</p>
<p><strong>some</strong>: less than light-fingered automotive work in
progress.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Hang on. Hong on. Don’t get your panties in a
twist.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Hey Irv, what the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Ohh… I dunno. About seven hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Now what can I do for you, Bub?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m here for the Civic.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Japanese car, right? Kind of a nasty pea soup
green?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well, they call it Emeral Forest,
actually…</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Burt! Pea green Civic!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Green Civic… Green Civic. Oh yeah! Brake drums
are still on order and I’m only halfway through rebuilding the
trans.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: But I just brought it in for an oil
change!</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Yeah? Well you’re lucky we caught those other
problems before they caused some serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Alright. Alright. When will it be
ready?</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Come back tomorro… …First thing next wee… …next
month? Yeah, first thing next month. That’s if we can get the parts.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What am I going to do in the meantime? I
can’t afford to keep taking cabs all over town.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Oh, hell… we can take care of that! Hey Burt,
bring around the loaner. And for you little buddy, only ten bucks a
day.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s a classic.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What is that, a
Rolls Canardley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know, a Rolls Canardley. Rolls down one
hill canardley roll up the next.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: We are not discussing the car, okay?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Whatever you say, man.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you think? Pretty terrific, huh?
This place make Sodom and Gomorrah look like Mayberry.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey, isn’t that…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Right. The wet dream from the bank.</p>
<p>****: Hold on… I think I see my future ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Hey Charlie! Charlie!</p>
<p>****: We’re in luck. It’s Barbie and Pebbles.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Doesn’t it bother you that all the women
you know are named after cartoon characters?</p>
<p><strong>barbie</strong>: We’ve been waiting out here for hours. Can
you get us in?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, problemo. Ladies, this is my pal
Stanley Ipkiss. Stanley’s very influential in the banking business.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What’s happening
man?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This will just take a second. Yo Nick! It’s
me… Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to stand here
waiting to be judged by these power-mad steroid jockeys.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How much cash you got on you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You heard me. How much you got?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, I’ll pay you back! I’m only carrying
plastic. C’mon man, you want to stand out here all night?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Charlie, how you doin’ man? Long time no
see.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m with them! Hey, Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>immediately</strong>: grab Stanley and quickly subdue
him.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey! Leggo… awk!</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Lose him.</p>
<p>****: Oh… Stanley. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>noxious</strong>: exhaust fumes.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey… Hey mister!</p>
<p><strong>hurries</strong>: as fast as he can.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hey, you! What are you doing down
there?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I was just looking for… My mask.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Thanks Reno, you’re the greatest.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: G’night, doll.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: That was a great performance, baby. But not
as great as the one you pulled off at the bank.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yeah, well don’t get used to it. I’m not going
to start running cons for you again, Dorian. I’m a singer now and that’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Oh, really? And you had such a red hot
career before you latched on to me?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Who latched on to who?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Get real, Tina. You’ll do what I say or I’ll
drop you back where I found you, slingin’ hash and dodgin’ horny
peterbuilt drivers.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Don’t push me, Nicky. I might just take a walk
I should have taken a long time ago.</p>
<p>****: Easy, baby. Easy. I love it when she gets pissed.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: C’mere. You take a hike and who’s gonna kiss
you like Dorian Tyrel.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: C’mon. Who?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: That’s right, baby. C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Sorry. I never get personal in front of the
help.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: That broad kills me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: She just might, man. The bitch is
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: C’mon Doctor, lighten up. Here’s to Edge
City Bank. May it crack like an egg on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a little more
careful next time.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thanks Officer.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, mister…</p>
<p><strong>death’s head</strong>: You a cop or something?</p>
<p><strong>as-fashion</strong>: oddments.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Uh… no. They just gave me a lift.</p>
<p><strong>death’s head</strong>: A cop chauffeur? I never seen that
before. How about you boys?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Alright, you guys. It’s been a tough night.
I haven’t got any money. I haven’t got a car. All I have is this and
you’re welcome to it.</p>
<p><strong>death’s head</strong>: Hey, man. You got us all wrong. We
don’t want any trouble. I was just going to ask you for the time. That’s
all. You got the time?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Uh… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>death’s head</strong>: See, I only wanted the time! Heh, he,
heh…</p>
<p><strong>the</strong>: Manager’s door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN
appears. She’s an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live
forever just to spite her relatives.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. peenman</strong>: Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time
it is?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Actually, no.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. peenman</strong>: It’s three o’clock in the morning!
First, you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals.
Then, you come in and start squeak - My new carpet! Just look at that!
This is coming out of your cleaning deposit Ipkiss!</p>
<p>****: Are you done?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. peenman</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I think I’ll be going to bed now.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hello, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Easy, buddy. I missed you too.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: C’mon, Milo. I’m beat. Okay, okay. One
throw.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Easy. This is the best part.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sorry Mrs. Peenman.</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: That’s correct. The truth is we all wear
masks, metaphorically speaking. We repress the Id… our darkest desires
and hide behind a more socially acceptable image of ourselves in order

Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you Dr. Neuman.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No thank you, Dr. Neuman.</p>
<p><strong>subtle</strong>: SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS

<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Naw…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee…</p>

<p><strong>the mask</strong>: S-s-s-nazzy!</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: It’s party time!</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: O, jeepers–!</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: Easy lady! I was just killin’ time!</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: Hey! You missed a spot!</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: by blowing into his thumb and hops up.</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: And next time, no starch!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey mister…</p>
<p><strong>death’s head #1</strong>: …You got the time?</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: Why of course, Cubbie. I got all the time in
the world!</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: London, Paris, Rome, standard, substandard and
no standards at all! And for our English friends we have… Big Ben!</p>
<p><strong>death’s head #1</strong>: Big Ben?</p>
<p><strong>death’s head #2</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: And for my next trick…</p>
<p><strong>an</strong>: elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK.
SCREECH.</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: And viola! We have a giraffe!</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: A few more twists of the wrist and for you,
Cubbie.</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: A French poodle! And finally my favorite…</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: A Tommy gun!</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: Wait a minute. This is incredible! Why, with
these powers I could be a superhero! I could fight crime… Work for world
peace…</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: But first!…</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Now these are serious chili dogs.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: I know. Here’s the proof… Aaah. Even tastier
the second time around.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Hey Burt, pull on my finger.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: No way, man.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: No, really. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Irv, don’t…</p>
<p>****: That, my friend is the sweet smell of success.</p>
<p>****: No style. I give it a five tops.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Okay, how about… Soprano.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Fine muscle control.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: And now for my grand finale, THX… The audience
is listening!</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Hey, 40 watt… we’re closed! Nobody’s here.</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: Ah… but you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: What I mean is…</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Nobody’s here that wants to help you.</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: But I’m here to help you.</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: Sounds like you have a little exhaust problem
there!</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: We better do a few touch ups before you have
some serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong>burt and irv</strong>: No!… Wait! Eeeeeyaah!</p>
<p><strong>jumps</strong>: out of bed with a start.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A dream… It was only a dream.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Nice PJ’s pal.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: You’re Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Some kind of prowler broke in and
attacked Mrs. Peenman.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Really? I didn’t hear a thing.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Then you must be a pretty sound
sleeper, Ipkiss ’cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot
five feet from your door.</p>
<p>****: That’s… impossible!</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s… a, possible. See, I have this inner
ear problem. Sometimes I can’t hear a thing.</p>
<p>****: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Here. You remember anything unusual about
last night, anything at all, call me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sure… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Milo, it was real! How could it all be…
real?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh my god. I’m late!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta admit your
description is pretty tough to swallow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. peenman</strong>: Then you can choke on it for all I
care. I saw what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Right. A green head the size of a pumpkin,
purple zoot suit and spats. That’s a pretty serious fashion risk for any
self-respecting second story man.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Lt., we just got an emergency call from a
mechanic on 67th Street.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Some kind of assault and battery. Sound
pretty bad.</p>
<p>****: Alright. Dont’ worry Mrs. Peenman, we’ll find this guy for you.
Officer Deluca here has a few forms you’ll have to fill out.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Milo! Keys! Keys!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>burt and irv</strong>: Ah!… Eeeh!… Ooh!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic #3</strong>: I want a proctologist standing by!
Yeah, you heard me! The best one you can find.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We were able to get a description Lt., but
it’s pretty weird.</p>
<p>****: Let me guess… Big green head. Zoot suit.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: How did you…</p>
<p><strong>kellway</strong>: Whoever this guy is, he’s a world class
twisto.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Excuse me, Lt., I’m with the Evening Star.
Can you tell me what happened here?</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Sorry. Too early to comment.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: It looks like some kind of mob scare
tactic.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: I said no comment. Now break it up. This
is a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>sifting</strong>: through some papers scattered all over the
floor. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What happened to you last night? The girls
and I were looking all over for you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I uh, didn’t feel so good. I decided to go
home early.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: As a matter of fact, you don’t look so
good. You got to take better care of yourself, man.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How was the club?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you kidding? It was hotter than a
pistol. Did you see the paper?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Your girlfriend got a great review.</p>
<p><strong>headline</strong>: “Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey’s Paw.”</p>
<p><strong>dickey</strong>: Ipkiss! You’re forty minutes late! Every
time you do that you’re robbing this bank of its time and money!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won’t happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>dickey</strong>: If you weren’t so busy ogling girlie
pictures you’d get some work done around here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ah… She’s a prospective client of
Stanley’s, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dickey</strong>: She is? Well… Next time she comes in see
that you send her directly to my office.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Look at that little creep. If it wasn’t for
his daddy he’d be out somewhere shakin’ down school kids for lunch
money.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You think she ever will come back,
Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A
dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal.
Ask her what her sign is and she’ll say dollar.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You don’t know that. She’s an artist. Maybe
she’s sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah. She can sense a guy’s credit line at
two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a
little more down to earth… someone like…</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find
Stanley Ipkiss?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Like her! Someone like her. As a matter of
fact I could use someone like her myself. Hel-lo there. May I be of some
assistance?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Stanley Ipkiss?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Hi. I’m Peggy Brandt. I’m with the Evening
Star.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, hi. I already have a subscription,
thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Oh no, actually I just wanted to ask you a
few questions.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Really? About what?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Ripley Auto Finishing. You’re a customer of
theirs aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I… uh. No. I think you must have made a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Isn’t this a form of theirs you filled
out?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess I have
stopped in there once or twice, Miss… what did you say your name
was?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Peggy Brandt.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Wait a minute… Peggy Brandt of “Ask
Peggy”?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You printed my letter last year, remember?
“Nice Guys Finish Last.”</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: You’re Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize
how much mail we got about that letter? There’s hundreds of women out
there who are looking for a man just like you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of
wood.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why are you covering this story?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: They cut my salary. I just can’t make it by
on “Dear Peggy” anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and
if I can break this story I know they’ll let me. Look Stanley, I know
Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the
Mob. I’m not out to get you. I just want the truth.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I wish I knew the truth, Peggy. I really
do.</p>
<p><strong>disappears</strong>: inside.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Good afternoon, Councilman Snell. Nice of
you to drop by.</p>
<p><strong>snell</strong>: Cut the crap. Dorian. What’s so important
that I had to come here in person?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: I got a little job for you, Tom. I want you
to pull the Swede’s gambling license.</p>
<p><strong>snell</strong>: That’s impossible. He was approved six months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Pull a few strings. Find something in the
fine print. I don’t care how you do it, but do it. You owe me.</p>
<p>****: I owe you nothing, you little piece of shit. I got your liquor
license when nobody else would touch…</p>
<p>****: That’s pretty. What is that, a carnation?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Nice. Hey, Eddy… call my florist. Two dozen
pink carnations to Mrs. Snell with my regrets over her husband’s
untimely accident.</p>
<p>****: No… please. I can do it. I can make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: That’s smart. You’re a very smart man. Now
pull yourself together. Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Shut the Swede down, Snell. We’ll buy him
out cheap with a little collateral the bank is about to provide us. And
Gentlemen… we are going to be in the casino business.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Or it could be two lovers. That would be the
woman on top, of course…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what her sign
is and she’ll say dollar.</p>
<p><strong>dickey</strong>: Every time you’re late Ipkiss, you’re
robbing this bank!</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: We must repress our Id… our deepest
darkest desires.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hey, are you okay.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I am now. C’mere, baby.</p>
<p>****: Oh, Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Tina?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Milo, down.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Stupid, stupid. She’d never…</p>
<p>****: No…</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Stanley… Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Just… one… last… time.</p>
<p>****: I gotta be me! I just gotta be me!</p>
<p><strong>mask</strong>: Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what you

<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: What’s the E.T.A.?</p>
<p><strong>sweet eddy</strong>: Another five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Counting down… now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Lookin’ good here, my man.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Nice work, Freeze. You boy are on your own

<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Do it, man. The Doctah is about to
operate.</p>
<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Gentlemen… Let’s do our duty and grab

<p><strong>dr. freeze</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>

<p><strong>decor</strong>: complete with live exotic birds in huge
indoor Banyon trees. WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way
across the crowded dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: There’s all kinds of men In this old world
That seek the affections Of a beautiful girl.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You can keep your cowboys on the farm The
gigolos don’t make me warm It’s mink my fingers crave to feel I need a
man with checks appeal.</p>
<p><strong>each</strong>: beat. Customers at nearby tables are
astonished.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Pretty boys are such a bore There’s manly
macho types galore But you’ll always know The diamond’s real If you’ve
got a man with checks appeal.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>eddy</strong>: We got trouble. You better come upstairs.</p>

SPINS her like a baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing
a beat.</p>

<p><strong>dorian</strong>: What the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I’ll be okay. Nobody puts the chill on
Freeze.</p>

<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Deal went south, Bro’. Someone else hit the
place before we did.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Who?</p>

<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Gee willickers! Does this mean we won’t
make the Star Search finals?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: This means you won’t make it out of this
club alive if you don’t tell me where my money is.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: You got a 27.5% in T-Bills amortized over

<p><strong>their</strong>: guns drawn.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Drop it, Tyrel!</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Hello, Kellaway. You got a warrant or did
you just drop by for a night cap?</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: I got probable cause. A couple of your
boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Easy, junior. You’re givin’ me a woodey.</p>
<p><strong>kellway</strong>: One of them was wearin’ some kind of big
green mask.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: For once you’re on the right track, but
that’s not one of my men. Maybe you ought to try a little actual police
work instead of this harassment bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: This isn’t harassment. You want to see
some harassment? Search the place, boys.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Ever wonder why you didn’t make Captain,
asshole? I got friends so high up they’d give you a nose bleed.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Well what d’ya know? I guess they gave you
one too.</p>
<p>****: You’re a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Lt., we got a stiff upstairs. One of the
guys from the heist.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Better call that high-priced lawyer of
yours, Tyrel. You’re comin’ downtown.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: I’ll be back on the streets before sunrise
and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Then just think of this as the city’s way
of showing you a little hospitality. I’ll stop by to tuck you in
myself.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: You’re on your own, boys.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Don’t worry, Lt. If he’s in there, well get
him.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: And if he’s not, I got a feeling I know
where to find him.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Police. Open up.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Ipkiss! I know you’re in there.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: All right, I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Lieutenant, what a surprise! What can I do
for you?</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: You can answer a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ve got to get ready for work.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Trust me. Your bank’s opening late
today.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Where were you last night?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Here… mostly. Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe it’s all
just a crazy coincidence that this so called “Mask” character always
seems to be wherever you are.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Mask – who?</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Don’t insult my intelligence, Ipkiss.
First, he’s spotted in your building, then the bank where you work and
now I find this at the Monkey’s Paw.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Milo. No! Okay, so I went out on the town
last night. A guy’s got to have a little fun.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: In your jammies?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Naw, I just took ’em with me in case I
didn’t make it home. I don’t know about you, Lieutenant. But I’ve got a
pretty good track record with the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Wait a second… you smell that?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: Bullshit. I hate the smell of bullshit. Don’t even think about
leaving town, Ipkiss. I’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What are we gonna do, Milo? What are we
gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>deputy oliveras</strong>: I don’t know, boss. That’s one
helluva rubber mask.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Where’s the lab report?</p>
<p><strong>deputy oliveras</strong>: We got fingerprints on some of the
currency, but nothing matches Tyrel’s men. Looks like this guy beat ’em
to the punch.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Get the bank’s employee files and run
down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.</p>
<p><strong>deputy oliveras</strong>: You figure it was an inside
job?</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Yeah, and all I need is a couple of
prints to lock this wack job up ’till doomsday.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: A fifty thousand dollar reward to the man
who finds this “Mask” character before the cops do. Get the word out to
every street hustler and low life in this town. I want him here. In my
office. Alive. By tomorrow! Now get going!</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You. You’re losing it Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: I’m losing nothing. Except maybe some extra
baggage I don’t need around here.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: You weren’t putting up much of a fight when
that green goon kissed you last night.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: C’mon, did it look to you like I had a
choice?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Maybe you did and maybe you didn’t, but I
know this, one day real soon I’m gonna run this town and when I do
there’s gonna be payback for anyone who crossed me. I mean anyone.</p>
<p><strong>mr. dickey</strong>: Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our hands
here and you stroll in over an hour late. If I have to put up with your
slovenly…</p>
<p>****: Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you’re
running this branch like it’s your own personal piggy bank! If the
I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for
you at Club Fed!</p>
<p><strong>mr. dickey</strong>: That will be all, Ipkiss.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Woah! What side of who’s bed did you wake
up on?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p>****: I haven’t exactly been myself lately.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there
buddy… and as a matter of fact I’ve got just the ticket. Or should I say
tickets?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m afraid to ask.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Saturday night. Grand opening of the
Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who’s anybody will be
there. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>stanely</strong>: I don’t know Charlie, I…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Excuse me a second.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Tina… What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I heard about the robbery. I guess I just
wanted to make sure you were okay.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, don’t worry about me.</p>
<p>****: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Are you sure? You look a little…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m just having a little trouble sleeping
is all.</p>
<p>****: I guess you won’t want to open that account after all this…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I’m not so sure I’ll have much to open an
account with anymore.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What about the nightclub? I thought you
were doing great.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I don’t know how much longer I can stay there
Stanley. Things are getting a little intense.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well, there must be plenty of other places
you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I wish it was that easy. There’s thousands of
girls out there just like me who…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Not just like you. You’ve got a voice like…
like an angel.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: An angel huh? That’s the first time I’ve heard
that one.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No, I mean it. You really do.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I can vamp my way through a tune. But that’s
not really singing.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What is it with you, Tina? Why don’t you
believe in yourself?</p>
<p>****: I guess I’ve just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys.
In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn’t a song.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So maybe you’ve been singing for the wrong
guys.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I’m not so sure there’s any other kind. Not
for me, anyway.</p>
<p>****: Well, I’m glad nobody got hurt.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops
have a line on him?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m not sure. Why are you interested?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Promise you won’t say anything?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: He came to the club last night and he was just
so… well, different. I haven’t been able to get him off my mind.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Really? They say he’s pretty weird
looking.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yeah. He’s ugly… but he’s kinda cool… y’know,
like Mick Jagger.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yeah. If you hear anything about him, would
you call me at the club?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Actually… I sort of know the guy.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The Mask. We’re - old college buddies him
and I.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh yeah. To tell you the truth, I’m sorta
covering for him on this bank thing. He’s not such a bad guy, really. He
just gets a little carried away.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I’ll say. Do you think you could give him a
message?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Tell him I want to see him again</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: When? I mean, I’d need to tell him
exactly.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: How about seven o’clock tonight at Peninsula
Park.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ll be… I mean, I’ll make sure he’s
there.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Sorry, doll. I had the locks changed this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: You what? You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: You’ve known we’re going condo for six
months, Peggy. I can’t stall the owner a minute longer. Either you pony
up the downpayment or you’re out.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Just a couple more days, Phil. The paper’s
ready to give me a full time job.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: I’ve heard that one before.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: C’mon, at least let me get a few of my
things.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Don’t make me regret this. We get a
certified check by noon tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort you out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Thanks Phil. You’re a sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>the figure</strong>: I heard you were lookin’ for a
story.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Who… Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>the figure</strong>: Just a guy with a little information
lookin’ to make a buck. But maybe I heard wrong. You don’t look like
much of a reporter to me.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: You give me something worth printing and I’ll
get you your money. What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: The guy they call the Mask and why Dorian
Tyrel’s willing to pay fifty large to get him.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: How do I find this Tyrel?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Careful, sweet meat. You break this story
and he just might find you.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Dorian… thanks for coming by, kid.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: My pleasure, Swede. It’s been too long. I
was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the
Hat.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: That? It was nothing. He was a pain in my ass
anyway. Here, sit down, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Congratulations on the new casino.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Thanks, but it might be a little early to
celebrate. As a matter of fact that’s why I asked you to stop by.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Here… have a little something to eat. That’s
Svenska meatballs, kid. The real thing.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: So, I tell you Dorian, it’s a terrible shame.
I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think?
All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city. Big problems. The
whole deal could fold.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Maybe I can help you out. I’m expecting to
come into a little investment capital shortly. If worse comes to worse
and you really need to bail out…</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: What a sweet guy. Isn’t this guy a
sweetheart? Thanks for the offer Dorian, but I think maybe I can solve
this myself.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: That’s right. You know that Councilman you
got in your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Well now you’ve got ’im in your mouth. How
you like that?</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Now listen close scumbag! You want to bw in
business with me? Okay, we’re partners now. I’m takin’ fifty per cent
off the Monkey’s Paw. You screw with me again and I’ll send you straight
down to Hell with your scumbag councilman. You can apologize for eatin’
him for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Sure, Swede. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Good. Now get out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>swede</strong>: Oh Dorian, here’s a couple tickets to my
grand opening. Stop by. And try to dress up nice. It’s good for
business.</p>
<p><strong>same</strong>: man we saw interviewed on “The Larry King
Show.” The byline reads “The Mysterious Powers of the Identities Within
Us.”</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: This is extremely unusual, Mr. Ipkiss.
Barging in without an appointment or…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Look, you’re the big expert on masks,
right? Well, I’ve got an emergency here!</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Try to calm yourself. Now this woman you
were telling me about, I’m not sure I understand the problem.</p>
<p><strong>stanely</strong>: I’ve got a date with the girl of my dreams,
only she doesn’t know it’s me…</p>
<p><strong>stanely</strong>: It’s this thing!</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Very interesting… looks like tenth or
eleventh century Scandinavian. Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I found it… or it found me. I’m not sure.
The problem is it’s ruining my life!</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: So you believe this actually changes you
into a different person?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes! It’s turning me into some kind of
lunatic!</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just
obsessional dellusion. What you have here is nothing more than a piece
of wood.</p>
<p><strong>stanely</strong>: But your book says masks…</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: My book uses masks as a metaphor for our
complex personalities. The masks we must present to the outside world…
to suppress the id. To protect our innermost desires.</p>
<p><strong>stanely</strong>: Yeah, well this one works in reverse.</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: You’re going to have to be willing to
work on this delusion or…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s not a delusion! Alright, I’ll prove it
to you if I have to, but I won’t be responsible for the
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no such
thing as a magical mask.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Last chance to hide all dangerous
objects.</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Alright then, go on. You’re not going to
frighten me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Whooooooooaaaaa…</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Whoa, what?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It didn’t work?</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Does that surprise you? The mask is
nothing but a reflection of you - the inner you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It worked last night. And the night before.
Maybe it only works at night… What kind of mask did you say this
was.</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Scandinavian. It looks like a
representation of Loki, the Norse God of Mischief. He supposedly caused
so much trouble that Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.</p>
<p>****: What if he banished him… into a mask?</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we’re out of time.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: But what should I do about my date?</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Your date?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know. Tonight. The park. Tina. Do I go
as myself of the Mask?</p>
<p><strong>dr. neuman</strong>: Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven’t you been
listening to anything I’ve been saying? Go as yourself. And as the Mask.
Because they are the one and the same, beautiful person</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>oliveras</strong>: I’ve got that cross-check from the bank
files.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>oliveras</strong>: It’s Ipkiss, Alright. Stanley Ipkiss.</p>
<p><strong>oliveras</strong>: You want us to pick him up?</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Don’t do a thing until I tell you.
Just keep the SWAT team standing by. If this guy’s half as bad as he’s
supposed to be we’ll need all the help we can get.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Stanley, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, Tina… Hi. You’re early.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I just… wanted to make sure you two got
together okay.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: That’s nice. You know, I hardly ever stop by
here. It’s hard to believe it was just a garbage heap.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s always beautiful at sunset. Those
methane emissions really pick up the colors.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Wow. They really do. All those pinks and
greens.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well… I’m sure my cousin will be along any
minute. He never shows up anywhere ’till after sundown. He’s sort of
strange that way.</p>
<p>****: I guess I’ll get going.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking
about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe
you’re right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn’t rely on
guys like Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Dorian… You mean Dorian Tyrel?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yeah. He’s sort of my manager.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Tina, you’ve got to be careful of that guy.
He’s a dangerous criminal.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You really mean that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Absolutely. You ought to hear the
stories…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: No, I mean, you’re really worried about me.
That’s… real sweet, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: C’mon, Tina this is serious. How involved
are you with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always
have.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a
nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven’t you noticed?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Look, this may sound a little cold but I do
what I have to do to get by, okay? I’m nobody in this town without
Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And who are you with him Tina? I’m not
exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I’m trying to find out. If
you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn’t be hanging on to some
kind of free ride.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry Tina. I guess I better get going.</p>
<p>****: Stanley… wait!</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Cher! Ce moi! Je’taime, Je’ taime, Je any
old tame! At last we are together mon petite bon bon!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: This is Kellaway. I need back up and I
need it now! Every available man down to Peninsula Park.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Looks like it’s gonna be a long night. My
wife is gonna kill me.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: What is it, Murray?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: The cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at
Peninsula Park. We just picked it up over the police band.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Let me cover it, Murray! You go on home to
Claire.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I don’t know, Peggy. Ramsey said…</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: I’ll take care of Ramsey. Thanks a million. I
owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Our love is like a red red rose, and I’m
feeling so thorny already, I’d like to nip you in the bud!</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Regular? Menthol? Filter? Cigar?
Cigarette? Tiparillo?</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Let me get that for you!</p>
<p><strong>sssuck</strong>: he smokes them all down to gray ash.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Aaaaaah. And now… amore!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Put your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: But eu ’tol me ’oo freeze!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Alright, alright. Unfreeze! You’re under
arrest!</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Under arrest! My god! The Law! I knew I’d
forgotten something!</p>
<p>****: I was so young! So foolish! So full of life!</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: What… What’ll they do with me, Sarge?</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Sorry, son. That’s not my department.
Search him!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Comb - Flintstones vitamins - Sousaphone -
Bazooka -</p>
<p>****: picture of Kellaway’s wife…</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: What the –?</p>
<p>****: Margaret!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: You son of a bitch – !</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: Jeez, I figured you had a sense of
humor!</p>
<p>****: After all, you married her!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>from</strong>: helicopters…</p>
<p><strong>bullhorn voice</strong>: It’s all over! Put your hands over
your head or we’ll open fire.</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: Hit it!</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: They rave about Sloppy Joe - the Latin
lothario - but Havana - has a new sensation.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: He’s really a modest guy - although he’s
the hottest guy - in HavAAAAna - and here’s what he has to saaaay -</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: They call me Cuban Pete - I’m King of
the Rumba beat - every time I play the maracas I go chick chick chickie
boom!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hey, he’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: Yessir, I’m Cuban Pete! The craze of
my native street! When I start to dance everything goes chick chick
chickie boom!</p>
<p><strong>stanley/mask</strong>: The senoritas they sing, and how they
sling their sombreros –!</p>
<p>****: And when they’re dancing they bring a happy ring to their
vaqueros - they sing their song, all the day loonnnggg -</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: You go out there and I’ll blow your brains
out!</p>
<p><strong>and</strong>: stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE
MASK. The music suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away
from the</p>
<p><strong>chorus</strong>: line, looking confused.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Goddamn it! Arrest that thing!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Halt! Halt or we’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Stanley! Get in!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thanks. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Someplace where we’ll be safe.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: I saw it. I saw the whole thing. What’s
happening to you, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s crazy… I’ve lost all control. When I
put on this mask I can do anything… be anything, but it’s ruining my
life.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Stanley, I don’t know what’s happening to
you, but I do know this. That letter you sent my column was from a guy
with more guts and heart than any of the creeps I’ve met in Edge City.
Whatever this mask is, you don’t need it. You… Stanley Ipkiss, are
already all you ever need to be.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean that?</p>
<p>****: Actually… no.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: What took you guys so long? I’ve been vamping here for twenty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: This is him?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: You have the fifty thou?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Right. When he puts on the mask he becomes
that green thingamajig.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Peggy, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Sorry, Stanley. You really are a great guy,
but I just can’t lose my condo. You know how hard it is to find an
apartment in this city.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Okay Ipkiss. Where’s the money from the
heist?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: My aparment. It’s in my apartment!</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Thanks. Now I believe you have a pressing
engagement.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Hey, you said you wouldn’t hurt him!</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: You’re right. Easy boys. One thing at a
time. Tell me about this mask, Ipkiss. How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t know… You just put it on!</p>
<p><strong>sweet eddy</strong>: Better be careful, boss.</p>
<p><strong>tyrannosaurus</strong>: Rex’s under eyes that glow green with
wicked power. His voice is a deep inhuman RUMBLE.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: What a rush.</p>
<p><strong>sweet eddy</strong>: Whoa, boss… are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: I’m better than ever, you idiot. Now
stop the presses. There’ll be a new headline tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sweet eddy</strong>: But what about him?</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: DO AS I SAY! I have other plans for
Ipkiss. Everything’s become so clear to me now!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Ah… excuse me. If you don’t mind, I’ll just
take my money and be going. You guys make yourselves at home.</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: Must you go? What a shame. You and I
could make beautiful headlines together.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Thanks, anyway. That wasn’t part of the
deal.</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: Of course. You only want what’s coming
to you, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Back off Freakazoid. I wasn’t born
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: Ah… But you might die today!</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: A girl like you deserves to have her
face plastered all over page one.</p>
<p><strong>sweet eddy</strong>: What do we do with Ipkiss?</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: The police are looking for the Mask. We
shall give them the Mask. And Eddy…</p>
<p><strong>sweet eddy</strong>: Yeah, Dorian?</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: Get the boys ready. The Swedes’
expecting us at the casino opening tomorrow night. We wouldn’t want to
disappoint him, would we?</p>
<p><strong>response</strong>: and elbows the other thugs to join in.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: That money better be where you said it was,
Ipkiss or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>dodging</strong>: pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the
car in sight.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: I still can’t believe it. Hardened
cops dancin’ in the streets… and broadcast all over the ten o’clock
news.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The SWAT team got an offer to open for Wayne
Newton.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: I’m history. The Captain’s going to
have my badge for breakfast. With a little pension on top.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: C’mon Lieutenant, it wasn’t your fault.
Something will turn up.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going to fall
right into my lap…</p>
<p><strong>his</strong>: lap -</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: …Ipkiss!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I can explain everything…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>lt. kellaway</strong>: You have the right to remain silent,
you freakin’ Looney Tune. Anymore of your half-baked wisecracks can and
will be used against you by me, personally…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’ve got to listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Go find yourself a new home, Milo. It looks
like I’m going to be here for a long long time…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Wake up. You gotta visitor.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: About time you found me a lawyer…
…Tina?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hello, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s wrong? Your boyfriend kick you out
for not delivering me on schedule?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Is that what you think - that I set you
up?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t know. But I’ve got plenty of time
to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You’re just going to have to trust me on
this.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Now is not the best time for me on trusting
women.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I ran out on Dorian last night, Stanley. I
just came to tell you I’m sorry. Sorry about everything.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You ran out on him?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: That magic mask of yours turned him into some
kind of monster…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He wasn’t exactly Mother Theresa in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: He’s going to the casino opening tonight and
he’s planning to do something terrible.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A real change of pace for him.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Half this town will be there Stanley. I tried
to tell the cops, but they wouldn’t listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: As long as he’s got the mask, there’s
nothing they can do to stop him anyway. There’s nothing anyone can
do.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: There must be some way. How does it work?</p>
<p>****: It’s like it brings you innermost desires to life. If deep down
inside you’re a little repressed and… a hopeless romantic, you become
sort of a love-crazy wild man.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: And if you’ve got a black heart?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Then the world’s going to be a very dark
place. And if I were you, I’d get out of town. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Lots of things. For really believing in me
when I couldn’t. For sharing a sunset with me. For being the first guy
to treat me like I was a person instead of a slab of meat. And for being
any kind of romantic. Even a hopeless one.</p>
<p>****: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You know, that night at the club I knew I met
someone special. Someone like nobody I’d ever met before.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The Mask.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: No… the guy that was inside the Mask all the
time. You. Stanley Ip -</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: –kiss.</p>
<p><strong>key-guard</strong>: Time’s up, lady.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I’ve got to disappear for awhile Stanley. I’m
not sure where I’ll go but I’ll let you know as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey! A girl’s being kidnapped out there! Do
something!</p>
<p>****: Baby, there you are… I was gettin’ all worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I just went out for a little while Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Looks like maybe a long little while, right
baby?</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: You know what happened to the last bitch
that ran out on me? Do you?!</p>
<p>****: No…</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Nobody else does either. Nobody ever
will.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Now fix yourself up, baby. And pick out
something pretty to wear tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: We’re going to make a big splash at that
opening. One this town will never forget.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: peers down the hall and sees</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Milo!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Come on, boy!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Come on, Milo!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Keys, Milo. Get the keys!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Good boy…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I said “keys” not “cheese”! Keys. K-E-Y-S…
keys!</p>
<p><strong>the</strong>: key-chain. He starts to pull when…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Atta boy, Milo. Now let’s see if we can get
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: applaudes and flashbulbs POP.</p>
<p><strong>the swede</strong>: So, ladies and gentlemen with a special
thanks to Mayor Tilton and everyone else who made this possible, I give
you… the Valhalla Casino.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: It’s almost time.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: I wouldn’t do that, Sweetie. We don’t want
to start the celebration early.</p>
<p><strong>dorian</strong>: Now sit back and try to relax. I’ve got to
change for the party.</p>
<p><strong>down</strong>: on his chair unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Ipkiss!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hold it! I warn you! I’m seriously stressed
out here!</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Easy, Ipkiss. Don’t be an idiot. You’re in
the middle of a police station. There’s no way you’re just going to walk
out of here.</p>
<p>****: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Now what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Putting myself in your custody.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: You are certifiable.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Milo!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Okay. Now we have to hurry or we’ll miss
the party.</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Of course. We wouldn’t want to keep Alice
and the white rabbit waiting.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Now move.</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: Don’t be shy, Tina. I know how you like
to make an entrance.</p>
<p><strong>dorian/mask</strong>: And I must say, that’s a dress to die
for. Or should I say in?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hi Lieutenant. Where are you taking
Ipkiss?</p>
<p><strong>kellaway</strong>: Ixnay! Ehay’s otgay an ungay… ouch!</p>
