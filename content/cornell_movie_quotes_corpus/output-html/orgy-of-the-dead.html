<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I am Criswell! For years I have told the
almost unbelievable, related the unreal, and shown it to be more…than a
fact. Now I tell a tale of the threshold, people, so astounding that
some of you may faint.</p>

1965</p>
<p><strong>fawn silver</strong>: as Black Ghoul</p>
<p><strong>pat barringer</strong>: as Shirley</p>
<p><strong>william bates</strong>: as Bob</p>
<p><strong>edward d. wood, jr.</strong>: From his novel “Orgy of the
Dead”</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: We sure picked the wrong night to find a
cemetery. Let’s turn back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No. It’s on a night like this when the best
ideas come to mind.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: But does it have to be in a cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You wouldn’t understand. Seeing a cemetery on a
night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror
story.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: But there’re so many wonderful things to
write about, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure there are–and I’ve tried them all. Plays,
love stories, westerns, dog stories. Huh, now there was a good one, that
dog story all about–</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: But horror stories! Why all the time horror
stories?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a
single word.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My monsters have done well for me. You think
I’d give that up just so I could write about trees, or dogs, or daisies?
Huhuh–Daisies! That’s it, I’ll write about my creatures who are pushing
up the daisies.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my
monsters, but it certainly doesn’t hurt your art of kissing.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: That’s life. My kisses are alive.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who’s to say my monsters aren’t alive?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All of my books are based on fact, or legend.
Thats perhaps why they’re more interesting and sell in the top
spots.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Well, fact or not, I don’t see how we’re
going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight. I can’t
see a thing! Let’s turn back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: There’s an old cemetery on this road. I’ve been
there before.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I’m getting the jitters! Let’s turn
back!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just as soon as I find a place wide enough to
turn around.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Not so fast!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Not so fast!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: It is said on clear nights, beneath the
cold light of the moon, howl the dog and the wolf, and creeping things
crawl out of the slime. It is then the ghouls feast in all their
radiance.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: The day is gone, the night is upon us, and
the moon, which controls all of the underworld, once again shines…in
radiant contentment. Come forth, come forth, o Princess of Darkness.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Time seems to stand still. Not so the
ghouls, when a night of Pleasure is at hand!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: If I am not pleased by tonight’s
entertainment, I shall banish their souls to everlasting damnation!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: And who is to be first?</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: One who loved flames. Her
lover was killed by flames. She died in flames.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: One who prowls the lonely
streets at night in life is bound to prowl them in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ahh, the curiousity of youth… on the road
to ruin! May it ever be so adventurous!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I’m so frightened.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well we certainly can’t stay here. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: In there.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: It frightens me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Silly, there’s nothing in there to be afraid
of.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Then..then what’s that music?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s what I want to find out. We have to get
help.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: What help can we possibly find in the
cemetery at this time of night?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Something’s making that music.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I’m not sure I care to find out what it
is.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All right. Don’t worry, I’ll be right beside
you.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: What help will that do if something in
there isn’t dead?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not dead? In a cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I can’t imagine anything dead playing that
music.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, it’s probably just the caretaker, and
that’s exactly who we want to find. They’ll have a telephone. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Could it be some kind of college
initiation?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s an initiation all right, but not of a
college as you and I know them. Nothing alive looks like that!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Can’t we get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m not sure…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m not sure, myself. It’s just a feeling I’ve
had since the crash…Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I would see for approval, the one who in
life worshipped gold above all else.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Be careful!–They’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Throw gold at her.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: More gold.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: More gold!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: More gold!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: For all eternity, she shall have gold.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: And both couldn’t help but remember a line
from one of Bob’s stories: “A sudden wind howls. The night things are
all about me. Every shadow, a beckoning invitation…to disaster. I know I
should think of other things, of pleasant things, but I can’t. How can I
think of other things, of pleasant things, when I am in a place
surrounded by shadows and objects, which can take any shape, here in the
darkness…Any shape my mind can conceive.”</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Bring ’em in!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: They are live ones?</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Live ones where only the dead should
be?</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and
me.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You shall both be rewarded. My Dear
Empress of the Night, put these intruders to the test.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: But they are not yet one of
us.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: A situation easily remedied.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: Tie them that they may
watch.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Fiend! Fiend!</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: To love the cat, is to be the
cat!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: A pussycat is born to be whipped.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: It will please me very much to see the
Slave Girl with her tortures!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Torture! Torture! It pleasures me!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I’m so frightened.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’ve got a right to be. We’re trapped by a
bunch of fiends.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Those creatures..!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t let them hear you.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know. I just don’t know. But don’t give
up. We’re not finished yet.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Easy Shirley, Easy! Panic won’t do us any good!
Let me think. We’ve got to stall for time.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I’m afraid I’ll faint.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whatever you do, don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Let her continue to learn. The time is not
yet right that they should join with us.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: …And what is this?</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: A symbol, Master.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: What kind of symbol?</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: She loved the bull ring and
the matador. She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own
destruction. Her dance is of skulls.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: She came to us on the Day of the Dead.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: El Dia De Los Muertos…A
celebration in her country.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Her dance has pleased me.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: With the loss of her lover,
this one cast herself into the Volcano’s fire.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: She was?</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: As I said, a worshipper of
snakes, and of smoke, and flames.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: It would seem so, Master.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: I don’t like snakes. I remember the one
Cleopatra used. Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue,
and those two sharp fangs. You’d never think such a little thing packed
such a big wallop.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Hurt her? Hell, it killed her!</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: We had lots of snakes in my ancient
Egypt…slimy, slinky things.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn.
AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: When I was alive, they were the things
nightmares were made of.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aaarrrgggaahh.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: She pleases me. Permit her to live in the
World of the Snakes.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Now, I will talk…to The Wolf Man…and The
Mummy.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: As you wish, Master</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: He wants us.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aaahhnnnahnnnn.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: What do you suppose for?</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Did you do something to get us into
trouble again?</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aannnnaahhnn.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Did you howl off-key at the moon
again?</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Aannnnaahhnn.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: I can’t remember doing anything wrong
either.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: We better go before we make him mad.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: We are your servants, Master.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Of course you are.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Have we in some way made you angry,
Master?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You know better than that.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: We don’t know of anything, Master…</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Then why do you shake so?</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: It’s not often an Emperor like you calls
on creatures like us.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Well rest easy, I’m not angry with either
of you.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Aaaahhhh.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Then it is some service you desire of
us.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You are the keepers of the Damned. You two
know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I
want…a decided change.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: The moon!…is soon gone!</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: There is little time left for
the remainder of the evening’s pleasures.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Yes, yes yes I know all that.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: At the first sight of the
morning sun’s rays, we must be gone.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I suppose most of the others will have to
wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: It would seem so, Master</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ahh, but I declare there is still time for
something.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: There are one or two which should
complement the night’s entertainment, Master</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ahh, good. Then I will see them. Dismiss
the rest.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Yes, sir, Master.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The ropes are coming loose.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I am–It’s our only chance.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Nothing is worth your life.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My guess is if we don’t take the chance pretty
soon, we’re not going to have much life left anyway.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I’m frightened. I’m so frightened.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Be careful, oh please be careful. We’ll
never get out of here alive, I know it. I just feel it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Yes I feel it in my bones.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re talking nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Oh, no I’m not. These heathens probably
have an open grave for us.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They wouldn’t dare put us in the same grave– or
would they?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I should hope not. I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That sudden?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Yes, that sudden. If it weren’t for you we
wouldn’t be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. It’s all
your fault.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: …And I thought you loved me.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Not yet. I perhaps have other plans for
such a pretty one. No matter, I will tell you when and if you may have
her.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: The Wolf Man informs me that
the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding
night. Now she dances with his skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Have you not enjoyed the evening’s
festivities?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ahh, that will soon change when you become
one of us!</p>
<p><strong>wwaaaaaaooooooooooaaaaahhgggghhhaaaa-</strong>:
AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: It would seem that The Wolf Man would have
you for his own!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I have promised both The Wolf Man and The
Mummy a reward. It could be that you are that reward.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You need not worry…Not just now,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Leave her alone, you fiend!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Fiend is it! You will not be so fortunate.
Your existence will cease within moments. No one wishes to see a man
dance… And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: If I could get my hands on you…</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: ..Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you
much pain.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Leave her alone, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I do not joke in my proposal.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: She is to be mine! It is so
spoken!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: The Princess of Darkness would have you
for her own to join us through extreme pain. Yet I am inclined for one
as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my
finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and
painlessly…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: No. No! No!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I repulse you? Very well. It seems you
have chosen your own fate. Live with it! I should say die with it!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ve got the ropes loose now. I’ve got my hands
free. Be careful–Don’t change your expression too much. They must not
catch on.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: What can we do against them?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know, yet. We’ll just have to watch our
chance. When it comes I’ll know what to do–I hope I’ll know what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I still don’t know what ever made me go
steady with a crackpot writer like you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All right. Put it on heavy.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: My old boyfriend Tommy would never have
gotten me in a mess like this. At least he’s got brains.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Him! I’ll bet he sleeps with all the lights
on.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: I could make her another Cleopatra…</p>
<p><strong>the wolf man</strong>: Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!</p>
<p><strong>the mummy</strong>: Without the snake, of course.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ahh, she will be yours.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: When!?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: At your discretion…But first, I desire
more entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: The moon is almost gone!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ahh, there is yet time.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: At the first sight of the
morning’s rays’ light…</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I know the laws of the night. I state
there is still time for yet another.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: I would have time for my own
pleasures!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Your own pleasure comes only after mine,
when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World. There is no one
to challenge my authority here. My word is the law–all powerful. No one
is to challenge that authority, no one!. Is that understood? It is my
command.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: I understand, Master</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Then see that it does not happen again, in
the penalty of Everlasting Despair. Now are there others?</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: There are others.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Well then let us proceed.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: She lived as a zombie in life,
so she will remain forever a zombie in death.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Easy, Shirley. Easy!</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: The moon sinks lower into the
hills! We must hurry to the finish.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I will decide the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: You had the mummy cancel all
the others scheduled for this session.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Then cancel my order.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: The moon is almost gone!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: There is yet time. Don’t you want your own
pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: Oh, if there is only time!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Hahh, there is always time… All in good
time…there is always time. You shall have your pleasure. THAT… I
decree</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: All others were but
infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to her This one would have died
for feathers, furs, and fluff…and so she did!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: The time…is short.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: For what!?!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Your pleasures of course!</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: You mean…!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You may take her now.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: Is there time?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You better hope there is.</p>
<p><strong>princess of darkness</strong>: Thank you, Master! Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Now hurry, hurry. I will watch! Your
desires may be my pleasure also…Our fitting climax to an evening’s
enter- tainment. You must…hurry now.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Easy, Miss, everything’s gonna be
alright.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Bob? Bob?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: He’s right here beside you. He’ll be
alright too.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Where are they, where did they go? They
tried to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #2</strong>: What’s this you say? Who was going to
kill you?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: The ghouls–they all turned into
skeletons.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #2</strong>: Take it easy, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: What she needs is a good rest.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: It’s true, I tell you, it’s true! They all
turned into skeletons. She-she cut me here.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Probably was bruised in the crash.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #2</strong>: You know, you two were very lucky.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive
me?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: There’s nothing to forgive. It was all a
dream.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: You love me then?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: As it is with all the Night People, they
are destroyed by the first rays of the sun. But upon the first
appearance of the deep shadows of the night, and when the moon is full,
they will return, to rejoice…in their evil lust, and take back with them
any mortal who might happen along.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Yes, they were lucky, those two young
people…May you be so lucky…But do not trust to luck, at the full of the
moon, when the night is dark…Make a wide path around the unholy
grounds…of the Night People. Who can say that we do not exist-Can
you?</p>
