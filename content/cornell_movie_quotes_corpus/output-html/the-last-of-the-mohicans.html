<h1 id="the-last-of-the-mohicans">the-last-of-the-mohicans</h1>
<p><strong>extremely close: part of an indian face</strong>: running
hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He’s
twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We’ll
learn later this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans.</p>
<p><strong>tan</strong>: is a huge elk that leaps at the sound.</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: We’re sorry to kill you, Brother.
Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and speed, your strength …</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Halloo! John Cameron!</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Alexandria! Set three more places. How is
Chingachgook, then?</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: The Master of Life is good. Another
year pass … How is it with you, John?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Gettin’ along. Yes, it is. Nathaniel.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I
see.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>alexandria</strong>: If Uncas is with you, that means he has
not found a woman and started a family yet.</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria
Cameron. They see into my heart.</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: Your farm good to you this year, John?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: It was a good year for corn.</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on the
river. Chief Joseph Brandt’s field.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You take much fur?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: That we did. John. But the horicane is near
trapped out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tradin’ your skins in Castleton?</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver.
French &amp; English want to buy with wampum &amp; brandy.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: So what is it, Jack? What brings you up
here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A French &amp; Indian army out of Fort
Carillon’s heading south to war against the English. I’m here to raise
this county’s militia to aid the British defense.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Folks here goin’ to join in that fight?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll see in the morning …</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Fathers of England &amp; France, both,
take more land, furs, than they need. They’re cold &amp; full of greed
…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Few’d deny that? Where you headin’?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Trap over the fall and winter among the
Delawares in Can-tuck-ee.</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: So I can find a woman and make Mohican
children so our father will leave my brother &amp; me in peace.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: A son like me?</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: No. You are too strong. Turn me old too
fast!</p>
<p><strong>alexandria</strong>: That’s what he’s doin’ to his mama …</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Dear Father, thank you for rewardin’ the
fruits of our labor with plenty. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: My father says he was driven out of France
by the black robe priests and he would fight them now but he lost his
arm and so I will go in his place.</p>
<p><strong>ongewasgone</strong>: John Cameron, thank you for your
hospitality … Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Francais. Trade
furs with Les Francais. Now Les Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting
grounds …</p>
<p><strong>ongewasgone</strong>: Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les
Francais. My brothers have asked me to lead them in this war so I speak
for the Twin River Council.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: His Majesty King George II is very
grateful for your support.</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: How far up the valley?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: To Fort William Henry.</p>
<p><strong>colonial #1</strong>: … two days from here.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: It should be enough to remind you France
is the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Your enemy …</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I said … France is your enemy. Not
ours.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Really? Do you want them to overrun all
New York colony?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: First place, you started it with the French
over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. Now you’re
sayin’ these people have a fight on their hands …</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Will you men help us stop the
French?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: … and while they are cooped up in your
fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: What then, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: For your own homes, for king, for
country, that’s why you men ought to join this fight!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: You do what you want with your own scalp.
Do not be tellin’ us what to do with ours.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: You, sir! You call yourself a loyal
subject?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: … No … Do not call myself much of a subject
at all.</p>
<p><strong>colonial #2</strong>: Nathaniel’s right. But if I got to
fight, figure I’ll try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of my
bean field.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Yes. Yeah. No …</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I am stayin’ on my farm. And any man who
goes, his family is welcome to fort-up with us ’til he comes back.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will
join-up to fill the county’s levy. But only if General Webb accepts a
few terms I got in mind …</p>
<p>****: Webb? what’s that, Jack …?</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: You boys marchin’ with us? What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: We had our say, Ian.</p>
<p><strong>exterior british encampment, parade ground - six
hundred</strong>: 62nd REGIMENT OF FOOT - DAY</p>
<p><strong>regimental sgt. major</strong>: Shoulder arms! Order arms!
Handle cartridge! Prime! Load! Draw ramrods! Ram cartridge! Return
ramrod! Make ready! Pre-sent! Make ready! Pre-sent! Fire!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Prime! Load!</p>
<p>****: … if they are not allowed leave to defend their families if the
French or Hurons attack the settlements, no colonial militia is goin’ to
Fort William Henry.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: You, there. Help my man outside with the
baggage.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: They will report or be pressed into
service!</p>
<p><strong>large colonial rep</strong>: Any of the boys worth havin’ can
disappear into forest … time it takes you to blink. Where’s that leave
ya, then?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: They will be found! Arrested …</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his
benevolence, would ever object to his American subjects defending their
hearth &amp; home, their women &amp; children, if threatened by the
“scourge” of attack from savages, aroused to such excess by our enemy,
the ever-perfidious French.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Does that mean they will be granted leave to
defend their homes if the settlements are attacked?</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You got yourself a colonial militia,
General.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir!</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: Duncan. How was your journey?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I didn’t experience anything so surprising
from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: And what is that?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: The Crown “negotiating” the terms of
service?</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: I know. One has to give Americans “reasons”
and make agreements to get them to do anything at all. Tiring, isn’t it?
But that’s the way of it here.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I thought British policy is ‘Make the World
… England’, sir.</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of
Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd
to Fort Edward.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Sir! … Might I enquire if General Webb has
heard from Colonel Munro’s daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in
Albany and escort them to the fort.</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: Yes. You may. You there. What does Munro call
you? The “Scotsman” has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: The Scotsman’s daughters are at the Poltroon’s
house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you
the way.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: By your leave, sir.</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: Explain to the Major we care little about
toying with colonial militia because we have little to fear from the
French. They have not the nature for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness
combines with their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would rather
make love with their faces than fight.</p>
<p><strong>webb</strong>: Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp.
See to it you’re there.</p>
<p>****: Heyward! Duncan Heyward.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: My God it’s good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I’m embarrassed to be so indecisive … after so
long apart and after you’ve traveled so far …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: And by sea!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You still have an aversion to the water?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Aversion? No. … “Hatred” … “Loathing” …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: But it was worth it all to end in a garden
by your side.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a
closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely … I
wish they did, but my feelings don’t go beyond that. Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Isn’t respect and friendship, a reasonable
basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time
…?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Some say that’s the way of it.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: “Some”?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Cousin Eugenie, my father, but …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Cora, in my heart, I know once we’re
joined, we’ll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you
trust, your father, help settle what’s best for you. In view of your
indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as
mine?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Will you consider that?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Yes. Yes, I will.</p>
<p>****: Duncan!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: My God, you’ve grown up.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We leave in the morning?!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Yes, miss.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I won’t sleep tonight. What an adventure! I
absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes
upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: My God, Alice.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: It can be dangerous …</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Nonsense. Papa wouldn’t have sent for us if
it were dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Atten-shun!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Shoulder arms!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Form two companies of nine … MARCH!!</p>
<p>****: Alice, did you see that …?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Alice?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Can we rest soon?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: You there, Scout!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: We must … stop … soon. Women are … tired.
You … understand?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: I understand. This is not good place to stop.
Two leagues from here. No water ’til then. That where we stop. Better
place.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the
ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: “Magua understand paleface is a dog to his
women. When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed
their laziness.”</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Excuse me. What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Magua say: “Yes. Good idea.”</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Form company! Left face! March!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Company make ready!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Present!!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Fire!!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Load! Prime!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Present! Present!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: No, Duncan!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: … case your aim is any better’n your
judgment.</p>
<p>****: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We need them to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: … why the bloody hell he do that to the
horses?!</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: … too easy to track … they can be heard for
miles … find yourself a musket …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Your wounded should try walkin’ back to
Albany. They’ll never make a passage north.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: We were headed …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: … Fort William Henry.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: … take you as far as the fort.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: If we are goin’ to take you, we need to
move. Fast … And the fort is well off our course. So if you all rather
wait for the next Huron war party to come by, we’ll be on our way.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: How far is it, scout?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Day and a half Where did you get … the
guide?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our
Mohawk allies.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: He is Huron and nothing else. Why would he
want to murder the girl?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Dark haired …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her
before today.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: No blood vengeance? No re-proach or
insult?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Of course not! And how is it you were
nearby?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Came across the war party, tracked ’em.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Then you’re assigned to Fort William
Henry?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Fort Edward, then?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: No. Headin’ west. To Can-tuck-ee.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I thought all our colonial scouts were in
the militia?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I ain’t your “scout”. And I am in no damn
militia.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Then you are one of those who would allow
England to fight alone while she protects you from France?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: England does not protect me and does not
war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on
her own account … of greed for land and furs.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Clear it up any?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I owe you gratitude or I’d call you
out!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Do not let gratitude get in the way …</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Yengeese no good in woods. Make more
noise, I kill him.</p>
<p>****: Anything to be done?</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: All dead …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Who were these people?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Ottawa!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Excuse me …</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Ottawa.</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: Mirrors … tools … clothes … all inside.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Movin’ fast, not able to carry much … this
was a war party?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Let us look after them …</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Leave them.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Though they are strangers, they are at least
entitled to a Christian burial!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Let us go, miss.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I will not. I have seen the face of war
before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as
cruel is your indifference.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Miss Munro. They are not strangers …. And
they stay as they lay …!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Why didn’t you bury those people?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Anyone lookin’ to pick up our trail, would
see it as a sign of our passing …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You knew them.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You were acting for our benefit. And I
apologize. I misunderstood you.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Well that is to be expected. My father
…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Your “father”?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Chingachgook. He warned me about people
like you.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Yes. He said … “do not try to make them
understand you.”</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Yes. And “do not try to understand them.
That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense …”</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Why did they turn back?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: “We’re a breed apart and we make no sense”
…?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: In your particular case, miss, I would make
some allowance …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You called Chingachgook your “father”? Where
is your real family?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: They buried my ma &amp; pa and my sisters.
And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up
as his own.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I do not remember them. I was one or
two.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: How did you learn English?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: My father sent Uncas &amp; I to Reverend
Wheelock’s school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds … though
we were told only bother learning readin’ &amp; arithmetic from
yous.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: And what were the consequentialities of
European culture you didn’t bother with?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about
the government of men. My father’s people already know each man is his
own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No
man is better than any other man.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: In London those radical ideas could land you
in Newgate prison. Why were those people living in this defenseless
place …?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: ‘Cos frontier land’s the only land
affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in
Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not
livin’ by another’s leave … Their name was Cameron. John &amp;
Alexandria.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: My father’s people say … at the birth of
the sun and of his brother, the moon, their mother died … so the sun
gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life. And he
drew forth from her breast the stars. The stars he threw into the night
sky to remind him of her soul. So there is the Camerons’ monument … my
folks’, too, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand
what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be,
thinking of it in Boston and London …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring …
to my blood … … than any imagining could possibly have been …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Much further?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are
downhill of it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Will we be able to bathe?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Thunder … Papa will arrange something.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: The men of the regiment will fetch water
from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice
…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora
doesn’t marry you, I shall.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Alice!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I can’t wait to see Papa …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: And you, Duncan? What are you looking forward
to?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Posting to a different continent.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I think it’s very important and exciting.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Lightning?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I’m Major Duncan Heyward!</p>
<p><strong>beams</strong>: Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn’t think you’d
make it through!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Where’s Colonel Munro? His daughters are
here, too.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Uncas! Nathaniel …</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: Thought you and Nathaniel weren’t
joinin’-up.</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: Didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Dropped in to see how you boys is
doin’.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Papa, Papa!!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Why are you here?!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Why did you allow them to come? … And where
the bloody hell are my reinforcements!!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Told you to stay away from this hell hole!
Why did you disobey me?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: When? How?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: My letter …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: There was none!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: There was no letter.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I sent three men to Webb!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: One called Magua arrived.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: He delivered no such message.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Does Webb not even know we are besieged?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly
does not know to send reinforcements!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Ambush … on the George Road. This Magua led
us into it. … eighteen killed. It’s these men who saved us. They guided
us here …</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Thank you. How can I reward you?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Help ourselves to a few horns from your
powder stores.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: Some food.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I’m indebted to you. And get your side sewn
up, young man.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Mr. Phelps!</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Miss Cora! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a
suturing needle? And we could use some rum, clothes, and a place to wash
…</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: What a place for them …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Might I enquire after the situation, sir,
given that I’ve seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine
and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make
thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two
hundred yard range, so when they’re close enough, they’ll move them in,
lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: They look to be three hundred yards out.
You have three days.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Bloody murderers.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: A man, here, can make a run straight
through to Webb.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: … not enough time to get to Albany and back
with reinforcements …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Webb’s not in Albany. He marched the 33rd
to Fort Edward two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Webb’s at Edward?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Only twelve miles away! He could be here day
after tomorrow. Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the
message.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: John Cameron’s cabin. We come upon it last
night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And it was Ottawa. They’re allied
to the French.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Yes, Mr. Poe? So?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: It was a war party. It means they’re on the
attack up and down the frontier.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Many men here, their homes are in the
path.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: That’s all, sir.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Things were done. Nobody was spared …</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Terrible feature of war in the Americas. Best
to keep your sight fixed on our duty. Our duty is to defeat France. That
hangs on a courier to Webb.</p>
<p><strong>seneca chief</strong>: … and the Black Robes of
Michilimackinac left us no time to put our cabins in order before
telling us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled our blankets
and were the first to be here. Yet we are not the first and closest to
my father’s campfire.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: For my children and the children of the
true faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless … I will give you
three oxen for a feast and tomorrow I, myself, will sing the war song
with you in the great council house.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your
English friends?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Louis Antoine, join us.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Hear what le Subtil has to tell us …</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward
with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my father’s army attacks Fort
William Henry.</p>
<p><strong>bougainville</strong>: But by now Munro knows his couriers
didn’t get through. He’ll send another.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: The Grey Hair will try.</p>
<p><strong>bougainville</strong>: Four or five, including two women
entered the fort …</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: The Grey Hair’s children were under Magua’s
knife but escaped. They’ll be under it again.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat
his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so
the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: My sappeurs are advancing the trenches
through the night, now. You may have your opportunity soon.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: She know what she’s doin’?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: First assisted me in Austria when she was
fourteen. I would say she does …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: She does not shy away from much …</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Mr Poe?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Miss. May I?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: You ‘bout done holdin’ hands with Miss
Munro?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Why, I am looking at you, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: You told him about the raid?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: He does not want to hear it. But he is
gonna have to.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get together by the West Battery James &amp;
Ian, Sharitarish &amp; William.</p>
<p><strong>uncas</strong>: Tight weave.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Another forty yards?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Sergeant! Form three ranks!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Sir! Upon the center, wheel to the
left-about! March! Rear ranks, proper distance! Front ranks, take your
distance! March! Halt! Make ready!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: First rank! Second rank! Present
arms!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Fire!!!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Advance, Sergeant Major!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Sir!!! Third rank! Twelve paces!
Forward march!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Shoulder arms! Present!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Fire!!!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Sergeant Major!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the
men.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Atten-hut!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Cora … I wanted to talk to you, but I’ll
come back another time …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Alice …</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Talk to Duncan, Cora … I must manage … I
cannot be an invalid schoolgirl. I’ll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything
…</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Her nerves are shattered. She’s trying to be
brave.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Cora, I adore you and, when we come
together, we will be the happiest couple in England … I am certain of
that. More than ever before. I believe you must trust the judgment of
others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Duncan … Duncan, I promised you an answer. You
have complimented me with your persistence and patience … But the
decision I’ve come to is I’d rather make the gravest of mistakes than
surrender my own judgment.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: And it’s been unfair to you, while I search
myself for feelings, which, if they were there and as strong as they
ought to be, would’ve made themselves known long ago … Take my
admiration and friendship, Duncan. And please take this as my final
answer. It must be no.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I see …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I am sorry, Duncan …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: … it was no raidin’ party out for pillage.
The cabin was attacked by a war party. They are sweeping south down the
frontier spreading terror among farms and Mohawk villages ’cos all the
men are here.</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: And my cabin’s not thirteen miles south of
Cameron’s!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I must receive proof more conclusive than
Mr. Poe’s opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to
withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Chingachgook’s of the same opinion. Taken
together, that’s gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb
and reinforcements, not these colonials’ presence.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop,
not you.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: That judgment is not more important than
their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms &amp;
families … Major Heyward was at John Cameron’s. He saw what it was.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: What did you see, Major?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I saw nothing that would lead me to the
conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: You’re a liar!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: And the blood is on your hands!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I’ll have none of that! Montcalm is a soldier
and a gentleman. Not a butcher.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Easy for you to suppose. While it is their
women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: You forget yourself!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We are not forgettin’ Webb’s promise!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: British promises are honored. And the militia
will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man’s
word!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nathaniel’s word been good on the frontier a
long time before you got here!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: This interview’s over! The militia stays!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Does the rule of English law no longer govern?
Has it been replaced by absolutism?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe
these people would do better makin’ a peace with the French!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: That is sedition! Treason!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: That is the truth!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I ought to have you whipped from this
fort!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Major! Some day I think you and I are gonna
have a serious disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving Fort
William Henry will be hung for sedition. Anyone leaving will be shot for
desertion. My decision is final. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: … got no kin in the settlements. If I did,
I’d be long gone.</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: You didn’t think it right to be here in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: By my light that’s how I saw it then and I
see it that way now …</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: But we are under English military
authority.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I believe if they set aside their law as and
when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All
they have over us is tyranny, then. And I’ll stay here no longer. No
force on earth will keep me here … Anyone caught leavin’ the fort could
be shot. So each man make your own decision … Those who are goin’, be
back here in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the
east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head
north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little
Meadow and you’re free of the outpost and skirmishers …</p>
<p><strong>a colonial</strong>: Should’ve skinned outta this long
ago.</p>
<p><strong>colonial #2</strong>: Got no families, Captain. Figured we’d
stay and give ’em a hand even though …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I’ll cover them from the top of the
casement.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re not coming with us?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Got a reason to stay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That reason wear a blue dress and work in the
surgery?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: It does and it is a better lookin’ reason
than you, Jack Winthrop. Push hard, ’cos you got to clear the French
outpost by dawn. Good luck, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You! Halt!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: As you were!!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Take him!</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Why do they make my son prisoner?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I helped Winthrop and the others leave …
This fight is not yours, father. I love you and my brother. And you
should leave this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee …</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: What will they do with my white
son?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get back from him!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: He saved us! We are alive only because of him
…</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: The man encouraged the colonials to desert in
this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be
tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for
my children.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: He knew the consequences. And he stayed. Are
those the actions of a criminal? … Duncan, do something.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: He knew the penalty for breaking
regulations. He ought to pay without sending you to beg.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You know he wouldn’t send me …! You
misrepresented what you saw and caused this. I, too, was at that farm.
It was as he said …</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Not with enough certainty to outweigh British
interests in this fort.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: And who empowered these provincials to pass
judgment upon England’s policies in her own colonies? To come and go
without so much as a “by your leave.”</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: They do not live their lives “by your leave.”
… They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying
their dead and their children along the way.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: You are defending him because you’ve become
infatuated with him.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable
qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong to have thought so highly
of you.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: But the man is guilty of sedition and subject
to military justice and beyond pardon.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: “Justice”? If that’s “justice” …, then the
sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it
will be for these people.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: You do not know what you are saying!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. And
if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Sorry … can’t ask you in.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: They’re going to hang you. Why didn’t you
leave when you had the chance?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Because what I am interested in is right
here …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: What would you have me do?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Webb’s reinforcements will arrive or not.
If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close
to your father. The French will protect the officer class among the
English.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: No. I will find you.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Do not. Promise me.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: The whole world’s on fire, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: This part of it sure is …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I don’t know. Whatever happens you stay
with your father. You stay among the officers.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Colonel Munro, I have known you as a
gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Please accept my compliments for the
strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a
lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and
material … mere chance has allowed me to array against you …</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a
diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: You have already done everything which is
necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony
that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there
was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I
beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: However I may apprise such testimony from
Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Honor that is freely accorded to courage,
may be refused obstinacy … These hills afford to us every opportunity to
reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your
weak condition as you are yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Perhaps the General’s glasses can reach to
the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb
…?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: My scouts intercepted this dispatch
intended for you.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Read the dispatch.</p>
<p><strong>bougainville</strong>: “Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I
have no men available to send to your rescue. It is impossible. I advise
you to seek terms for surrender. Signed Webb.”</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: This is the signature of Webb. And I know
the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk
in Hudson Bay, they’d fight to the end.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: You have heard your answer, Monsieur le
Marquis.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Sir. I am incapable of mistreating brave
men. I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have
listened to my terms.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Such as …?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: My master requires the fort be destroyed.
But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be
denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They’re
free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this
continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Their arms?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: They may leave the fortress fully armed,
but with no ammunition … Other than that, ask what you wish.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: The honors of war?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Granted.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: My colors?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Carry them to England to your King with
pride.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Allow me to consult with my officers.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I have lived to see two things I never
expected. An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too
honest to profit by that advantage.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: General Webb can burn in hell. We’ll go
back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to
fight.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Death and honor are sometimes thought to be
the same. Today I have learned that they are not.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: The decision is final.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I am deeply touched by such unusual and
unexpected generosity … The fort is yours under the condition that we be
given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their
march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Granted, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Qui vive?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: France.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Le mot d’ordre?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: La victoire.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: C’est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin,
monsieur!</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Il est necessaire d’etre vigilant, mon
enfant.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Is the hatchet buried between the English and
my French father?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men
become friends.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: My master owns these lands and your father
has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented
to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Magua took the hatchet to color it with
blood. It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be
buried.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: But so many suns have set since Le Renard
struck the war post. Is he not tired?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the
hill. It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and
kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European
masters who are always greedy for more than they need. And Le Subtil is
the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains.
But now he has come to lead his nation.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: That Le Renard has the power to lead his
people into the light, I know well.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Does my father know that?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: That’s where a lead bullet has torn
you.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: My son has been sadly injured. Who did
this?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. And
the sticks left their mark … Magua’s village and lodges were burnt.
Magua’s children were killed by the English. Magua was taken as a slave
by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua’s wife believed he
was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of
all this. In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free.
In his heart he always was Huron. And his heart will be whole again on
the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: My son Magua’s pain is my pain.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Does the chief of the Canadas believe the
English will keep the terms?</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: Munro would. But General Webb will not
send their soldiers across the salt lake. Having let them go, I fear I
will only fight the same men again when I move south. And yet, I cannot
break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France …</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Many things my French father cannot do, Magua
can.</p>
<p><strong>montcalm</strong>: As the English march away, our soldiers
and the Canadiens will be drawn to the looting of the fort … except for
a small guard …</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: I wonder at the blindness and pride of the
white man. He believes only he knows how to speak falsely to make other
men do his bidding.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Monsieur, the fort is yours.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Steady! No one fires!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Men are to stay in file, Sergeant
Major!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Do not break ranks! I want these ranks to
hold …!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Right - about face! March! First
rank present!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Prime! Load! Second rank six paces
forward! Present!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Cora!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Cora! Alice!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime!
Load! Third rank! Present!</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your
living chest in front of your eyes. As you die, know that I will put
under the knife your children and wipe your seed from this earth forever
…</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two,
present! Rank two, hold!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Rank two, six paces back! Rank one,
present!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: You got nothin’ better to do today on Lake
George than shoot me, Major, then go ahead …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Stop it!!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: When you fall into British hands again,
Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat #1</strong>: Can’t … keep it up …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Pull!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Only chance we got is … … to get more
distance on ’em and go to ground!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Pull!!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Pull …!</p>
<p><strong>redcoat #2</strong>: Spent.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Head for … for the white water.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Do you hear me, sir! If you ever fall …
into British hands … What white water?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Here’s where it gets tricky …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Don’t move …</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Where do we go from here?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: I don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: This is it, as far as we can go … If we’re
lucky, they’ll be figurin’ we can’t have come this way and must’ve
beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we’re very lucky, they’ll
figure we went over the falls.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Then we take the south rim down the
mountain and it’s 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: And if we’re unlucky?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: You will have to forego the pleasure of
hangin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Any powder?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye:</strong>: Only one or two loads.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Are we safe?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Maybe …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Our father? Did you see my father?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Say nothing to Alice …!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Uncas …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Yes. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: What the bloody hell plan is this?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: In this there is a chance. If I live, I can
try to free you. If we don’t go, there is no powder, there’s too many of
them. Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance.
None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Yes. I want you to go.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Coward! Coward back at the fort. Coward
here.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You try. With all you have. To save yourself.
If the worst happens, and only one of us survives, something of the
other does, too …</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: If they don’t kill you, they may take you
north up into Canada. A warrior may take you for a wife.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Listen. Submit. You hear me? You’re strong.
You stay alive. I will find you … no matter how far, how long it takes
…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: … never doubt what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers …
will receive many gifts.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Gifts?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Three, four oxen … much wampum.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Wampum?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Does Yengeese Major have property across salt
sea?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.
Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four
oxen.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Gold could be arranged.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: For Munro children?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: How much gold has the master of the
Yengeese?</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: The King? The King has mountains of
gold!</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Not enough.</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: What is enough?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Heart. Give Magua new heart.</p>
<p><strong>sachem</strong>: The tomahawks of your young men have been
very red.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Many of the Yengeese are dead, great Sachem.
I have brought three of my prisoners, to honor you. Two are the children
of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from
his chest.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: … the earth was pale. Our tomahawks were
bright. Now they are dull from war. And the Huron rich with the trophies
of honor … Magua will sell the English officer to Les Francais and the
reward is my gift to you, wise one … The women - children of the white
war chief - will burn in our fires so all can share in this.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Nathaniel!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Translate for me, Major. Into French. Every
word … as I say it.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I come to you unarmed and in peace to
unstop your ears, wise one. Because the Hurons are mislead by the words
of the wolf who’s never spoken the truth.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro
go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of
their helpless ones.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the
Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Wise one, the French fathers made peace and
swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is
false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: It made our French father happy to never have
to fight the same Yengeese again. He told me this without telling me
this.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: So the Huron are the servants of the
French? To do what the French are shamed to do?</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: No. Huron serve no one. The French father
believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is
blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French
one … Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron
is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les
Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the
Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk &amp; Fox. And make the Huron great.
Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Magua would use the ways of Les Francais
and the Yengeese …</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: The red man put down the bow, picked up the
fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the
only way.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers
foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the
white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use?
Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease?
Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest
for beads &amp; brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold? …
Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the
ways of Huron men who hunt &amp; work the land? Or of dogs? … Magua’s
heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog,
become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? … Magua’s way is false. It
is like the white sickness. Magua’s way will bring only sadness and
shame. Is there another way? I don’t know. I am Nathaniel of the
Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people …
Let the children of the dead Munro go free … I speak the truth.</p>
<p><strong>sachem</strong>: The white man comes like a day that has
passed. And night enters our future with him … Our council talks since I
was a boy: What is the Huron to do? But Magua would lead Huron down
paths that make us not Hurons. Dark girl burn in fire to heal the
twisted heart of Magua.</p>
<p><strong>sachem</strong>: Munro daughter with moon in her hair must be
Magua’s wife so Munro’s seed doesn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>sachem</strong>: … and Yengeese officer not go to Les
Francais, but back to Yengeese so their hatred burns less bright. La
Longue Carabine, go in peace.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: No! listen. Tell him I’ll trade him! Me for
her! Tell him!!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a
great honor to the Huron. Take me!</p>
<p><strong>magua</strong>: This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to the
Hurons of the Lakes! You are women. Send your arrows and guns to the
Seneca, beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. Slaves, dogs,
rabbits, thieves … I spit on you!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: I said to trade me!</p>
<p><strong>heyward</strong>: … compliments, Mr. Poe. Take her and get
out.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: And my compliments to you …</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Alice?</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life
…</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye :</strong>: … a warrior goes to you swift and
straight as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him and let him take his
place at the council fire of my people. He is Uncas, my son. Bid them
patience and ask death for speed; for they are all there but one - I,
Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Will you go back to England?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I have nothing to go back for.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Then will you stay in America?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: And will you be my wife?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Where will we go?</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: Winter with the Delaware, my father’s
cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle
with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: The frontier moves with the sun and
pushes the red man of the wilderness forests in front of it. Until one
day there will be nowhere left. Then our race will be no more, or be not
us … The frontier place is for people like my white son and his woman
and their children.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: That’s my father’s sadness talking.</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: No. It is true … One day … there will
be no more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. Like the Mohicans.
And new people will come. Work. Struggle to make their light … One
mystery remains.</p>
<p><strong>hawkeye</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>chingachgook</strong>: Will there be anything left to show
the world that we ever did exist?</p>
