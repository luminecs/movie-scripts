<h1 id="lord-of-war">lord-of-war</h1>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There are over 550 million firearms in
worldwide circulation. That’s one firearm for every twelve people on the
planet. The only question is… …how do we arm the other eleven?</p>
<p><strong>ukrainian officer</strong>: Call it “agricultural
machinery”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of
Odessa in a country that no longer exists. You might have heard of it -
a little place called the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: All property is theft.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Where I grew up, everyone was equal. Some were
just more equal than others.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Shortages? What shortages?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My father was a wounded hero of World War Two,
my younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan - a war without heroes.
I’d gotten out of military service due to a heart problem - it wasn’t
completely a lie.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: –Finally, in response to human
rights protests and in an effort to encourage the United States to sell
grain to the Soviet Union after two successive crop failures, it is
reported that the politburo has consented to permit a limited number of
Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel. And that concludes
this edition of news from the BBC World Service.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Trading Jews for grain.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: It’s good P.R. - for the Moscow
Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>irina</strong>: Good for the Jews.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: And us.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: We’re not Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We’re Jewish if we say we’re Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Mazeltov.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There have been few occasions in the twentieth
century when it’s been an advantage to be a Jew.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The rubbing from the Jewish headstone was my
first forged document. Little about my life has been kosher ever
since.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We Russian Jews were supposed to be headed for
Israel but I didn’t see much of the country on that first trip.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Real Jews or fake Jews, eighty-five percent of
us ended up in that other “promised land”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We congregated in New York’s Brighton Beach
because of its similarity to the Crimean Sea. I’ve always thought it’s
appropriate we moved next door to the circus.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I had no idea my father would take his assumed
identity so much to heart. I guess he just stayed in character.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: How many times–I can’t eat shellfish. It’s
“treyf”.</p>
<p><strong>irina</strong>: You’re not Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: I like it. I like the hat - to remind us
there’s something above us. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>irina</strong>: You’re not going to temple. You go to temple
more than the rabbi!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I was suffering an identity crisis of my
own.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My gift for languages made me highly sought
after. The C.I.A. and U.N. were both heavily recruiting Russian
immigrants.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Naturally, I went with the U.N. They were
paying more.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The fastest way to find out you can’t change
the world is to actually go there.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: West Africa’s Liberia, or “land of the free”,
was originally established in the 1800’s as a homeland for freed
American negroes. It’s been enslaved by one dictator or another ever
since. They even copied their masters’ Southern architecture.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It was my first meeting with the American-
educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste. While the warning signs were all
there, no one had any idea what a monster he would eventually become. I
certainly didn’t think he would become my friend.</p>
<p><strong>u.n. envoy</strong>: –With all due respect, Mr. Baptiste, you
don’t seriously expect us to believe that this represents your entire
arsenal.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: –World order? You say we jeopardize world
order?</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: I am only going to the restroom.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Orders.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: This is what they mean by U.N.
Observer?</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: Aren’t you going to help me hold my
cock?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Doesn’t look like a job for two men.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: You know you are fighting a losing battle,
my young friend. War is nature. If you take away the guns, we will kill
each other with knives. Take away the knives, we will kill each other
with sticks. Take away the sticks, we will kill each other with your
peace treaties. You cannot stop this bath of blood.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s not “bath of blood”. It’s, “blood
bath”.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: Thank you. But I like it my way.</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: And now, we have a surprise for you. The 83rd
West African Peacekeeping Corp is proud to present, all the way from El
Salvador, the newly crowned Miss World, Ava Cordova.</p>
<p><strong>u.n. peacekeepers</strong>: Take it off, baby! Take it
off!</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Baby blue. My favorite color!</p>
<p><strong>u.n. peacekeeper</strong>: My hope is for a piece of your
ass!</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: I don’t know if you’ll be taking me to bed
tonight, darling, but you can take her.</p>
<p><strong>u.n. peacekeeper</strong>: Ava! Ava!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Don’t touch what you can’t afford.</p>
<p><strong>u.n. peacekeeper</strong>: Let’s get drunk.</p>
<p><strong>monrovian girl</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: For the smile.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Fuck, no, no, no, no–fuck, no. Money? You want
money? Fuck, no. Don’t shoot. Don’t shoot me. Fuck. U.S. dollars.
President Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: Glock .45.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: President Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: You are driving a hard bargain.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No, keep it. Keep the money. Keep the gun.</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: What do you take me for - a thief?</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: Demand and supply. There is more I am
thinking where this comes from.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You want more Glocks?</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: And the Heckler &amp; Koch G-3 assault
rifle.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What makes you think I’ll do that?</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: I will come back and shoot you with
the Glock. By the way, do you have the hollow point cartridges?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You got any color preference for that?</p>
<p><strong>liberian man</strong>: Kelly green. I will find you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He’d come to the right place - peacekeepers
are armed to the teeth. And nothing but premium product. The U.N. mostly
buys from Switzerland - where else?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What are we doing here, Yuri?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You know what I mean. Here, in this country.
Are we doing any good?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Would nothing be better?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The starting salary for a U.N. interpreter
back then was $32,000. I made fifty K on “misplaced” weapons on that one
trip alone. I doubt the Secretary General noticed. The U.N. spends more
on lunch.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My tour as a peacekeeper was the perfect
preparation for war.</p>
<p><strong>irina</strong>: Who are you? You’re not my son. My son
doesn’t own such a suit.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You know who’s going to inherit the earth?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: It’s a hell of a fucking career move.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: That’s the point. I’ve seen how the world’s
coming apart.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: And you want to help with that?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You can’t stop it. It’s a basic human need -
we eat, sleep, sleep with each other and what else? Fight. The oldest
human skeletons have spearheads in their rib cages.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: What do you know about guns?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I know which end I’d rather be on. Every day
there are people shooting at each other. I think to myself, what guns
are they using? Why not mine?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vitaly, I’ve tasted your borscht, you’re no
fucking chef. I can eat here for free and I still don’t eat here. You’re
doing nothing with your life.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Maybe doing nothing’s better than doing
this. Yuri, I’ve actually fired one of these things.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: That’s why I need you. Brothers in arms.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Finally getting in touch with what’s
important, my Son?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It wasn’t God I was trying to get close
to.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Dad’s contacts at synagogue landed me my first
Israeli-made Uzis and an introduction to the biggest of the big
guns.</p>
<p><strong>asian businessman</strong>: –I can get you the shoulder-fired
SA-7 surface-to-air missiles. The older Chinese model. Not so effective
against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commercial
airliner. I’m giving them away at eight-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It was the eighties and the Cold War was far
from thawed. Most of the deals were government-to-government. There were
some go- betweens - freelancers - but it was a mostly private club with
a lifetime club president.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: That’s him. The guy Eli told me about. Simeon
Zaharoff. Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war - both sides, sold
missiles to Argentina in the Falklands. Hets a fucking legend. I’ve got
to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Simeon! Simeon!</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: They’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton
Beach Import-Export said to contact you. I have a business proposal.
Perhaps we can discuss it - over a drink.</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: You’re in the wrong place my young friend.
This is no place for amateurs.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yob tvayu mat.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Curious how you always revert to your native
tongue in moments of extreme anger…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: …and ecstacy.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Boh…Boh. Oh, Boh!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vitaly and I found our niche in under-the-
counter gunrunning - regimes suffering under sanctions.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The job wasn’t so different trom the U.N. I
was just as neutral working for the ununited nations. An equal
opportunity “merchant of death”, I supplied every army but the Salvation
Army.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We got our start in Lebanon after the suicide
bombing.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: When the United States leaves a war zone, they
generally don’t take their munitions. It costs more to bring it back
than buy new stock.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I sell by the kilo.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: For all my language skills, I soon discovered
that what talks best is money. As long as you can speak dollars, dinars,
drachmas, rubles, rupees, pesos, escudos, lira, krones, kwanzas, trancs,
guilders, deutshmarks, yen and pounds-fucking- sterling, you can
communicate anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking
potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: What do we do, go more legitimate?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No. More illegal.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: What I’d give right now for a plate of red
cabbage and potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s not our fight.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I sold to both Pakistan and India in their
fight tor the most inhospitable land on earth.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>indian commander</strong>: We’re making terrific progress -
most casualties from avalanches and frostbite.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Make sure you thaw out the guns before you
fight.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We had our set-backs. It’s not called
gunrunning for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Cannibal, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cannibal</strong>: Cease fire, man. Cease fire. It’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What?! What do you mean it’s over?</p>
<p><strong>cannibal</strong>: Truce. We’re friends, man.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Friends?! You can’t be fucking friends. Last
week I spoke to you on the phone. You said you would not rest until
every last rebel was dead. You called them vermin. You said would piss
in their mouths, you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches.
Just last week, you said this!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal</strong>: That was last week, man.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Cannibal, don’t you fucking walk away from
me!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal</strong>: Peace, man!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Fuck you, Cannibal!!</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: At least when they say they’re going to have a
war, they keep their word.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when they
were still fighting fellow Russians. But I never sold to Osama bin
Laden. Not for any moral grounds. Back then he was always bouncing
checks.</p>
<p><strong>afghani official</strong>: I hope you’re not thinking of
selling these, Mr. Orlov.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Personal use.</p>
<p><strong>afghani official</strong>: There’s a hundred thousand bullets
here.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m kind of trigger happy.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: And everywhere I went, Ava Cordova kept
following me around. We were as international as each other.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Operations like mine provided the only way for
certain regimes to conduct a respectable war.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The freighter I was standing on carried 113
tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery to one of the poorest
nations in Latin America in direct contravention of half a dozen
international arms embargoes.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: To keep authorities in the dark, I often spoke
in code. Rocket launchers were “mothers”, the rockets “children”.
Assault rifles were “apples”. The AK-47 was “the Angel King”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The Angel King will arrive tomorrow…Hallelujah
to you too.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Do we run?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: We have to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No, no-one’s going anywhere. Slow–dead slow.
Buy me time.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Yuri!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: I’ve got Belgium.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What the fuck use is that?! He’s painting a
name registered in the fucking Netherlands!</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Yes, why?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Turn it on its side.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: They say every man has his price - but not
every man gets it. Interpol Agent, Jack Valentine, couldn’t be bought,
at least not with money. For Jack, glory was the prize.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Not exactly “The Love Boat”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s Yuri. Phone in a sighting of the Kristol
south of Aruba.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Nice job.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Hey, pay before you play.</p>
<p><strong>narc leader</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Hey, fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>narc leader</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No, you don’t fuck him–</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The first and most important rule of
gunrunning is never get shot with your own merchandise.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The second rule is always ensure you have a
foolproof way to get paid. Credit card, check, cash. Preferably in
advance, ideally to an off-shore account. It’s why I choose my customers
so carefully. Say what you like about warlords and dictators, they tend
to have a highly developed sense of order. They always pay their bills
on time.</p>
<p><strong>narc leader</strong>: I apologize for earlier.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>narc leader</strong>: It’s all there.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>narc leader</strong>: Six keys of pure.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I can’t hand this to my fucking bank teller at
Chase Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>narc leader</strong>: You should be thanking me. Have you
checked the street price today? With the seizures at the border last
week, it’s jumped thirty percent.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I sell guns. I don’t sell drugs.</p>
<p><strong>narc leader</strong>: Diversify.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’ve got standards.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vit.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I found Vitaly twelve days, two thousand miles
and 150 grams later in a Bolivian boarding house.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vitaly! Open this fucking door!</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Yuri! It’s my brother, Yuri. He’s my big
brother.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Ukraine. I start in Odessa, work my way to
the Crimea–</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: –You’ll be fucking dead before you reach
Kiev.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: You fuck!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vitaly, you’re going to have a good time. This
is a top place. Two Ford models checked in last week and that cute
weather girl’s been here since July.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: You’re a good brother.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I never understood what separated the
recreational drug user from the habitual, the functional addict from the
dysfunctional. But for the grace of God, it could have been me snorting
lines as long as the Belt Parkway.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vitaly never got completely clean despite the
prayers of my mother…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: …and father. In fact, my younger brother was
the only reason my father ever had to question his new religion.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: After Colombia I became a one-man-operation. A
sole proprietor as you say on your tax return - that is if you’re
foolish enough to fill one out.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: By then I’d mastered my craft. Selling arms is
not so different to selling vacuum cleaners. You advertise, pound the
pavement, take orders.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be a
political scientist. I go by a seven-step approach.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: One: identity a government and an opposition
where the opposition is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Two: Wait for a radical group to break away
from the opposition.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Three: Immediately approach the radical group
and offer them arms.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Four: Whether they buy or not, inform the
government that the radical group approached you and offer the
government arms.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Five: Whether they buy or not, re-approach the
radical group and offer them more arms but now at a higher price.
Increasing tension is a means of generating demand and the ideal
situation is to sell to both sides.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Six: If they start shooting at each other, the
escalation is underway.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: They are consuming small arms and ammunition
and the cash register is well and truly ringing.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Seven: Don’t forget that the success of a
radical group in one country can inspire a radical group in a
neighboring country.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: –There’s really no one else you’d consider?
Christie and Brooke are both available…not the right look? It’s just
that Ava doesn’t generally do print.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The product? Er,…Colt .45. The beer.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It cost me twenty for the fake booking,
another twelve to buy out the hotel. You can’t force someone to tall in
love with you but you can sure make ita damn sight easier.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Popular hotel, huh?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yuri Orlov. What brings you to St. Barts?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: A photo shoot. At least, that was the plan. But
the photographer’s plane got stuck in Miami. Hurricane - though there
was nothing in the news.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Those things can come out of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: The job’s cancelled and there’s no flight back
to New York ’til Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You can hitch a ride with me if you like.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: In my experience some of the most successful
relationships are founded on lies and deceit. Since that’s where they
usually end up anyway, it’s a logical place to start.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I nearly went broke trying to convince her I
was anything but. I knew Ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by
a ride in a private jet unless you owned the jet.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: This is your plane?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: That is my name.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Of course I was lying. The plane was a rental,
like the car and even the suit I was standing in. At the last minute, I
bribed the crew for the paint-job.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn’t
looking anywhere but in my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Don’t apologize. I put on clothes for a
living.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: At least you aren’t taking them off.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: I would be if half the photographers had their
way. But I can’t complain. I’m paid to say, “Cheese”. What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Nothing so glamorous. I’m in transport -
international air freight mostly.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: What, like UPS or something?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Business is good.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Like you, I can’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: But if you did?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Well…I don’t know. It’s just that I travel all
around the world but I can’t help feeling sometimes that I’m going
nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: This is no accident, is it, Yuri?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I don’t believe in fate.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: What do you believe in?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We married in a synagogue to make my father
happy. In the eyes of my Catholic mother, it was worse than living in
sin.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s traditional.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Traditional.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Always remember, son, there’s something
above you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sure, Dad. A forty-thousand dollar crystal
chandelier.</p>
<p><strong>irina</strong>: You need this.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I was still living way beyond my means,
mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card to payoff another. Anything
to keep Ava in the style to which she had, thanks largely to me, become
accustomed. Then suddenly all my Christmases came at once.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Jesus was Jewish. You’re worshipping a
Jew.</p>
<p><strong>irina</strong>: Ava, this is too much.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yuri likes to spoil you.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Nicki! You did it. Good boy!</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: That’s my grandson.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yuri. Don’t you want to see what your son is
doing?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Tak! Tak! Tak-fucking-tak!</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: What the hell’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s over! It’s over!</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: What’s over?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil
Empire. Mikhail’s saying “no mas”. He’s throwing in the towel. It’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: That’s nice. Your son is crawling.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: At least there’ll be religious freedom.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I think I’ll go back for a visit. Do you stay
in touch with Uncle Dmitri?</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Dmitri Volkoff? Now and then.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: The luckiest man alive. You know he was one
of the first men at Chernobyl. Off-duty, at his daughter’s wedding, he
was roaring drunk. He was the only one who survived. Later they found
that alcohol in your blood resists radiation.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He’s still a General in the army?</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Major General. He got promoted. Two of his
rivals were also there that day. I told you - he’s the luckiest man
alive.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He may be luckier than you think.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: We’re not fools, Yuri. What’s between you
and your wife is your own business but I don’t think you’re going to
Odessa to open a McDonald’s. Is this how you want to be remembered?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You’re only remembered when you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: It’s not kosher.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Merry fucking Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Vitaly, who is this?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Angel.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Her name really is Angel. She’s a fairy.
Let’s stick her on top of the Christmas tree.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m going back to Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: I miss Odessa. I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I miss you too.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There’s no problem leading a double life. It’s
the triple and quadruple lives that get you in the end.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Back then I carried a French, British, Israeli
and Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the U.S., but that’s
another story.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I also packed five different briefcases
depending on the region of the world I was visiting.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The end of the Cold War was the beginning of
the hottest time in arms dealing. The Wall had fallen. The arms bazaar
was open. Those forty-five years had generated the highest weapons
build-up in history. The Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the demon
hole - huge stockpiles and now no enemy.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: Visa?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s good to be home.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Nephew, come here and hug the luckiest man
alive.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: This is the SLK?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: 0 - 60 in 4.8.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I can’t just sell you government property,
Yuri. I have to report–</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: –Report to who? Moscow? As of last week Moscow
is in a foreign country.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: New flag, new boss.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There is no new boss yet. They’re too busy
squabbling over who gets the presidential holiday home at the Black
Sea.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How many Kalashnikovs do you have?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: 40,000.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Is that a “4”? It doesn’t look like a “4” to
me. It looks more like a “1”.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: No, it’s a “4”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s whatever we say it is because no one else
knows the difference.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Someone will work this out, Yuri. What
happens then?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We’ll cut them in. Anyway, what could happen -
you’re the luckiest man alive.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947 - more
commonly known as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov. It’s the world’s most
popular assault ritle - a weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple
nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and molded plastic. It doesn’t
break, jam or over-heat. It will shoot whether its covered in mud or
filled with sand. It’s so easy, even a child can use it. And they do.
The Russians put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag.
Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian
peoples’ greatest export - after that comes vodka and suicidal
novelists. One thing’s for sure, no one was lining up to buy their
cars.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Of course my idea was not entirely unique. I
had rivals.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He’s a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: Do you know who the fuck I am?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Who the fuck cares who the fuck you
are?</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: I demand to see your commanding officer.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: You don’t demand shit.</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: Just give me back my papers.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: What papers?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You’re late, Simeon.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: You sell guns?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Maybe you’d like to come to my room and see my
bazooka.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You look a little lost, Simeon. Is the world
changing too fast?</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: I am here, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not all of you, I think.</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: I can’t deny, it takes some getting used to.
Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we’re going
into business together.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There’s no place in gunrunning for politics
anymore, Simeon. I sell to leftists, rightists. I’d sell to pacifists
but they’re not the most regular of customers.</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket
but there are the other satellite states. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland,
Belarus. Instead of cutting each other’s throats, it may be more
profitable to work together. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I think you are the amateur now. I think you
suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy. I
think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct.</p>
<p><strong>simeon</strong>: The problem with gunrunners going to war is
there’s no shortage of ammunition.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Back then, it was all for sale…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Helicopters, torpedo boats, armored personnel
carriers, whole tank divisions.</p>
<p><strong>ukraine major</strong>: –I’ll tell you what I’ll do. Buy six,
you get one free.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What about tech support?</p>
<p><strong>ukraine major</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Son, get off there before you get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ukraine major</strong>: He’s the tech support.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He’s twelve.</p>
<p><strong>ukraine major</strong>: Thirteen. Almost fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Kids grow up fast around here.</p>
<p><strong>ukraine major</strong>: He can take it apart in his
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: How can I? You keep selling my helicopters.
You’re too greedy, Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We have to go back.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: We’ll be going in reverse. We can’t turn
around for a mile.</p>
<p><strong>young soldier</strong>: They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: We shoot it out?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: And start an international fucking incident -
no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: So we run.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No. I’ve got paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Not for the gunship. Yuri, you know the
penalty for sanction-busting - selling a military helicopter?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s not a military helicopter. It’s a rescue
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yuri Orlov.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Papers.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The crew called that vessel a lot of names -
none of them repeatable in polite company.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: The end-user certificate for this
aircraft states Burkina Faso. Nice. Did you type it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s for humanitarian missions.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You’re a humanitarian?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not any more.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Listen to the nephew.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Didn’t you get the memo? The war’s over. What
can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What, yes?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The only way you could die from this baby is
if a food drop hits you.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Also going to Burkina Faso?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But to a different client at a different
address.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What do you take me for? A complete
fucking fool?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not complete, Sir. And while I hesitate to
tell you your job, I must point out that when shipped separately the
weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade
standards and practices.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You expect me to believe this is a
coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I can see how certain people might interpret
it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone
does not constitute a crime.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Yuri Orlov. You and I are going to be
seeing a lot of each other.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I can hardly wait.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Watch out for the time you don’t see
me.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What was he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Trying to beat your offer. I sent him on his
way. He doesn’t understand the concept of loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Don’t worry. There’re more VCR’s. I left them
in your new car.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Even your enemy was admiring that car. I am
the luckiest man alive.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Dmit–!!!</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yes, I’ll accept the charges.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Ava–</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Hey, baby. You forgotten what time it is?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sorry. I, er… How was your audition?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: They’re going in another direction. The
direction of someone who can act.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Don’t say that. You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: And you’re biased.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Where are you? Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Rough day at the office.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Come home. We miss you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Soon. How’s Nicki?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Asleep in our bed. It’s lonely without you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: A party.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: It’s always a party where you are.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’d better go. I just wanted to call–hear your
voice. Kiss Nicki for me.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: In Ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of
arms have been stolen and re-sold. One of the greatest heists of the
20th Century.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The primary market was Africa. Eleven major
conflicts involving 32 countries in the past decade - a gunrunner’s wet
dream.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My best customer was self-declared president
of Liberia, Andre Baptiste. Even though we’d met before, I was in no
hurry to meet him again. He’d gotten a reputation for routinely hacking
off the limbs of those who opposed him. His seven-year civil war has
been described as “a relentless campaign of sadistic, wanton violence
unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of man’s capacity to
visit the abyss.” That kind of sums up Andy for me.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: Mr. Yuri, I am Andre Baptiste Junior. My
father would like to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Thank him but I have other business. A busy
schedule.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: It is not optional. My father is easily
offended.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What do you know? My schedule just freed
up.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But if I thought I was scared of Andre Senior,
I knew I was scared of Andre Junior. Like father, like son. The guava
doesn’t fall too far from the tree. He was a heavy- drinker, a womanizer
with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast American
automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the
streets of the capital. Oh yes, he was also a cannibal. They say Andre
would eat a victim’s heart while it was still beating to give him
superhuman strength. I could’ve told him he’d get the same effect from a
pastrami sandwich at Carnegie’s Deli.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Monrovia itself was like being on another
planet. Planet Monrovia. From the temperature it was obviously a planet
close to the sun. I rarely saw another white man even at my hotel that
was soon dubbed the “Little Kremlin”. And I never left town alone.
Outside town, was the edge of hell. I didn’t want to even gaze into
it.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: This is your hotel. Two stars.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Part One, Two or Three?</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: I have only seen Part One.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The M60. You want the attachable grenade
launcher?</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: Please. And the armor piercing bullets.
I will be back to get you in an hour…or two. It’s Liberia. We left a
welcoming present in your room.</p>
<p><strong>hotel porter #1</strong>: My God, he nearly cut off her
head.</p>
<p><strong>hotel porter #2</strong>: When I get to America, I will not
live in Brentwood.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: In the most AIDS infested region of the globe,
where one in four is infected, Andre’s idea of a joke was to put a young
Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and no condom within a hundred
miles.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Hello, Mr. Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: We’d be happy to make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Don’t worry, we don’t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Do we look like it?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What if I have AIDS? Don’t you worry?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: You worry too much.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Why worry about something that can kill you
in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: How can we make you happy?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: By leaving.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: –that’s the Beretta, comes with a 36
cartridge, easy-operating clip–</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Now you’re going to have to buy it. It’s a
used gun. I can’t sell a used gun.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: A used gun. That’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I had heard of the “Boy Brigades”, “Small Boy
Units”, “Kalashnikov Kids”. The theory was that a bullet coming from a
fourteen year old is just as effective as one trom a forty year old.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: I can’t pay your asking price, Yuri. We
are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your
Kalashnikovs. In some places you can buy one for the price of a
chicken.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You can’t just look at the unit price. You
forget the ancillary costs. End user certificates need to be forged and
notarized, shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews
hired. Not to mention the bribes. You can’t get a nut and bolt out of
the Eastern bloc without a bribe. There’s one bribe for the nut. Another
for the bolt. This is an expensive proposition.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: I pay in timber…or stones.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’ll take the stones. It’s hard to get a tree
trunk in my hand luggage.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: Very professional, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I know you’re planning a new offensive. If you
delay a week I can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked
about. They would give you a significant strategic advantage.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: They say I am the lord of war. But perhaps
it is you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s not “lord of war”. It’s “warlord”.</p>
<p><strong>baptiste</strong>: I like it my way.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Diamonds are far less bulky than hundred-
dollar bills. You can get a million dollars into a cigarette box.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: By the mid-nineties, my wealth had caught up
to my lies about my wealth - even surpassed the lies.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yuri, I just got off the phone with the dealer.
I sold my first painting.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Fantastic. Who bought it?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Someone important. They want to remain
anonymous. How was your trip?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You know. Same old, same old. Where’s Nicki,
in bed?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: I’m sorry. Poor darling. He tried to stay
up.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’ll kiss him goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: This calls for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: My first painting. I’m officially an
artist!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I figured I was a patron of the arts and of
everything else Ava had tried and failed at after modelling. Acting, her
own cosmetics line. I didn’t sabotage her careers but I can’t deny it
was convenient for me in maintaining a low profile. She was a beautiful
bird in a gilded cage.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How are you, brother?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: You know, still the resident family
fuck-up.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Someone has to do it.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: She knows, right?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We don’t talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Shit, you’re good. You almost had me
convinced. We’re going, baby.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: To Manet, Monet…and Ava Cordova.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yuri!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The trip went better than expected.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yuri, they’re beautiful. But what am I going to
wear them with?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I know just the outfit.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I didn’t know how much she knew and how much
she ignored. I was a good provider and as far as she was concerned -
loyal. Despite the other women, I always made love to Ava as if she was
the only one.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Take Park.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: This is good.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Where in God’s name is he going? Is he
lost?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Vitaly…it’s Ava.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I was now the best merchant of death alive. I
didn’t own my own plane. I owned a fleet - running guns into Liberia,
Sierra Leone or the Ivory Coast at least once a week. Unfortunately, my
friends at Interpol were also starting to find West Africa on the map.
Most trips I had phoney paperwork. If the deadline was tight, I had no
paperwork at all.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: –Even taking into consideration the pay-off
to the parents, a week with a girl in Burkina Faso is cheaper than a
night with a girl in Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Plus, they’re cleaner–</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: –and a lot of them speak better English.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Personally, I prefer a language
barrier–</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: –Charlie, Echo, India. Descend for
landing on heading zero…two…nine.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Colonel Southern, it’s Yuri. Sorry to call you
on this number but I’ve got an Interpol jet and–</p>
<p><strong>col. southern</strong>: I can’t know you right now. It’s not
a good time.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not a good time!</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: –Charlie, Echo, India. Comply
immediately. That was your last warning.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Where was the first fucking warning?!</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Rock your wings if you intend to
comply.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I’m putting us down.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You land and we’re all going away! I don’t
have paperwork!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We’re in a flying fucking bomb! They’re
firing bullets at our bullets! Forget about going away! They shoot
again, we’re going away for good! I’m putting us down.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Okay! Okay!–Fuck!!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: This is Charlie Echo India. Descending on
heading zero two nine.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not the airport. There. The highway. It’s our
only fucking hope.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: A pothole could set us off.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Don’t underestimate yourself. You’re the best,
Tony.</p>
<p><strong>interpol pilot</strong>: I can’t land there.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: He can’t get far. I want a truck waiting
on the tarmac.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We’re going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: As far from the evidence as I can.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Wait, you idiots! There’s not going to be any
evidence! Stay with the plane!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Help yourselves. Be my guest. No charge.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: shutting off the calculator in</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Hey, not those! You don’t touch the plane! Not
the fucking seats…</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>mbizi</strong>: You run from us. Can you run with no
legs?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: No, Mbizi. No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>mbizi</strong>: Let me disappear him, Mr. Valentine. He is a
devil. Let me disappear him.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>mbizi</strong>: Look where we are. Who will know?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: We will.</p>
<p><strong>mbizi</strong>: Turn your back, Mr. Valentine. I will go to
hell to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: No. Find the pilots.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What’s the charge?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What are you doing in Sierra Leone?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m on safari.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Shooting wildebeests with submachine
guns?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Are you with the park service? Hunting without
a license - is that the charge?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You’re trafficking arms.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Trading. But without evidence who can say?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by
keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other. Do you know
why I do what I do?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I don’t want people dead, Agent Valentine. I
admit, a shooting war is better for business. But I’d prefer people to
fire my guns and miss. Just as long as they’re firing.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I am legally permitted to hold you for
twenty-four hours without charging you.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You’ll be pleased to know your colleagues
were no more co-operative than you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yuri! Yuri Orlov!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vivian…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You know. Fighting the good fight.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: An aid program?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Uh, yes. In fact, I’ve just had some transport
problems. You couldn’t give me a ride to Monrovia, could you?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Sure. Climb in.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Jesus! Simeon!</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: A gift for you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Me?!</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: Who do you think informed on you - cost
you your plane? He came to meet my father, hoping to take your
place.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You stupid old fuck!</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: He killed your man when he tried to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: You want us to let him go?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No. No. I…</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: So you do want him dead. You just don’t
want to kill him yourself? I understand.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: We’ll do it together. A bonding
experience.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: You can stop if you want - but you do.
Just say the word.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: I’ll get you another room with a nicer
view.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I started doing a lot of cocaine in West
Africa. I wasn’t medicating myself. I was simply playing catch-up. I was
constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the
aid of chemicals. It’s just a matter of etiquette. It’s rude to act sane
in a room full of lunatics.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: He bought you “brown-brown”, Mr. Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: “Brown-brown”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What does the gunpowder do?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: It’s magic. They give it to the small boys
before battle - they do anything.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Some other time.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You have to try it at least once,
Mr. Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Because it’s your gunpowder.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m going for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I didn’t fuck you, did I? Did I fuck you?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: It’s not what I would call a fuck.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Are you sick?</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: They will!</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: They won’t!</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: They will!</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: They won’t!</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: They will!</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Ask the foreigner. The foreigner will
know.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Sir, will my fingers grow back?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Simeon.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Don’t. He’s Andre’s.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Fuck Andre.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yeah, fuck Andre.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m sorry. They don’t usually do that. Let me
have a look. Maybe I can fix it.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: Yuri, you fucked up! I am going to
shoot your face off with your own gun.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not bad. Andre’s latest double?</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He’s too eloquent.</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: You have no heart.</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: Have you seen the news? They accuse
me of rigging elections, but after this in your Florida with your
Supreme Court of kangaroos–</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: More good news. That’s the last aid shipment.
The war is so bad, the U.N. is pulling out.</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: Why is nothing happening?</p>
<p><strong>andre, jnr.</strong>: No trucks. They are trapped on the
front lines.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There are trucks. You just have to get all
that food out of them.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: Killing certain humans can be considered
humanitarian. Isn’t that right, Mr. Yuri?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: After surviving the last few days I’d started
to feel like I was invincible. But there was a weapon that could hurt
me.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Hush, Nicki. I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I was hoping you could help us with that.
I understand your parents died tragically in EI Salvador. That regime
has startling similarities to several of the regimes supplied by your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>master of ceremonies</strong>: And now, one of the sponsors
of tonight’s evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Ava?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Ava, what’s wrong? Where’s Nicki?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: He’s with your parents.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Why aren’t you dressed? I thought we were
going out.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: I can’t wear the clothes. I can’t wear the
jewelry. I can’t drive the car. I can’t live in this house. Everything1s
got blood on it.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Don’t be so melodramatic.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Of course I’m melodramatic. I’m a failed
actress, remember? We need to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Why? We never have before.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Now we do.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: These people - you can’t trust them–</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: –I’ve talked to your parents. Why do you think
they don’t want your money? They know where it comes from. We all
know.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I sell people a means to defend themselves,
Ava. That’s all. I don’t hold a gun to any one’s head and make them
shoot–</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: –Yuri, I see the news. Sierra Leone–</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: –I don’t sell machetes.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: –What do you think is pointing at the victims
when they use those machetes? I see the pictures. Yuri, the guns are
bigger than the boys.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There’s nothing illegal about what I do.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: I don’t care if it’s legal, it’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Please stop.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It makes no difference if I stop. Someone will
take my place the next day.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Let them. We have enough. You’re not that
little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for a loaf of bread–</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: –It’s not about the money.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You can’t leave. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: You will? You promise?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yes. Now get dressed. We’ll go out.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: For the next month I stopped running guns. I
went legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No wonder Valentine was confused.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Thank God there are still legal ways to
exploit developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But the only problem with an honest buck is
they’re so hard to make. The margins are too low. Too many people are
doing it.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: –Impossible. Two and a quarter? I can’t make a
profit at two and a quarter. Why don’t you take my oil and I’ll fucking
pay you?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the
lobby.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He’s early.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: –You should come to Liberia with me
tomorrow. It is beautiful this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: Liberia. Is that on Long Island?</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: Yuri!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: We’re here for the peace talks at
the U.N.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: So at the same time you thought you’d drop in
on your arms dealer?!</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: Is that what you still are? You’re a
hard man to get hold of all of a sudden.</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: –But now you mention it, we are
doing a little shopping while we’re here - that is if you open for
business.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: They’ve got to be watching.</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: Of course they blame me. They always
blame me. They are on a–</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: –hunt for a witch?</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: “Witch-hunt”. But I have been
granted diplomatic immunity due to the escalation in hostilities. That
is why I need you. They are making life difficult to re-supply. It will
require a man of your unusual ingenuity.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I can’t help you. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>andre baptiste</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: You still haven’t brought me the gun of
Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Was that about the oil or the timber?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Both. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: At four and a half months a human fetus has a
reptile’s tail - a remnant of our evolution.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You can fight a lot of enemies and survive but
if you fight your biology you always lose.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye? I’m
leaving in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.</p>
<p><strong>nicolai</strong>: Bye, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: See you, big guy.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Personally, I’m glad you’re going. You’ve been
here so long you’re starting to get on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: This oil concession should be wrapped up by
Thursday. I’ll be back for the weekend. We’ll go somewhere - the
sea.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: That would be fun.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You trust me, right?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She looked me directly in the eye the way I’ve
looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials, government
bureaucrats and footsoldiers from every law enforcement agency in the
world - and she lied without flinching.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yes, I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She’d learned from the best.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>nicolai</strong>: Where are we going, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: It’s a game.</p>
<p><strong>nicolai</strong>: Like hide and seek?</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I can always sense when I’m being tailed. I
know what to look for. But then I’d never been tailed by the woman I
love.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I can put myself in Ava’s place. She might
have understood if the combination was the last four digits of my
social, my birthdate, even her birthdate but not Nicolai’s.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My son’s birthday unlocked what the government
would later describe as, “a catalogue of carnage”.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Not that. Not that, Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Come to see how the other half lives?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I miss your borscht. Mom and Dad say you’re
clean.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: You too. They said you went legitimate -
hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: That’s because it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Only you know. I’m leaving tonight - on a job.
I want you to come.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: I can’t. I’m thinking of opening my own
place.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Maybe this trip will help. It’s good
money.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: I’ve given my word.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: They don’t have to know. We’ll tell them we’re
going for a little “r” and “r”.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Why do you need me all of a sudden?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: West Africa’s fucked-up. More than usual. I
can’t trust anybody. I need someone to watch my back.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: RUF - “freedom fighters”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Every faction in Africa calls themselves by
these noble names - “liberation-this”, “patriotic-that”,
“democratic-republic-of- something or other”. I guess they can’t own up
to what they usually are - “federation- of-worse-oppressors-than-the
last-bunch-of- oppressors”. Often the most barbaric atrocities occur
when both combatants proclaim themselves “freedom fighters”.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Yuri, I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: We can’t do this deal.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The fuck we can’t.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Look over there. As soon as we leave,
they’re going to die.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s not our business.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: They killed a boy just now - as young as
Nicki.</p>
<p><strong>rebel leader</strong>: What’s the hold up?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: There is no hold up. I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Today we can. They’re right there - close
enough to touch.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What do you think they’ll do if we back out -
they’ll kill us.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: And if we go ahead - they’ll kill them.</p>
<p><strong>rebel leader</strong>: What is he saying?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Nothing. You’re right, Yuri. You’re right.
Did I hear you say 300 IPG’s, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades? I
thought it was 1,200 grenades. I’d better check.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly</strong>: Something for Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>andre jnr.</strong>: Step away - slowly.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vit!!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning.
Never pick up a gun and join the customers.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone.
Demand is so high. Fortunately, we had a lot of boxes just the right
size.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I don’t know which is worse, Jewish guilt or
Catholic guilt. My parents were like God’s tag-team.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But I could not deny them the chance to say
goodbye to their eldest son.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed
the lead from Vitaly’s body and wrote a bogus death certificate. I
should have paid more.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’ve smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition
and the bullet that lands me in jail is found under my dead brother’s
rib.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Yuri Orlov, we’re with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Believe it or not, I only use the first
two.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You have the right to remain silent. Use
it.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: “Crimean Restaurant”.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Papa?</p>
<p><strong>irina</strong>: Both my sons are dead.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: One of yours?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Maybe he did. If I saw one of those coming at
me, l’d have heart failure.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: We performed the autopsy and released
your brother’s body to your family. You tried to do something decent,
Yuri. You went against your nature. And now it’s cost you. Your
brother’s funeral is looking a lot like your funeral.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Falsifying a death certificate? That’s not
going to hold me.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You’re right, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: This. Tell me that I am everything you
despise, that I am the personification of evil, that I’m responsible for
the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order, that I am
a one man genocide. Say everything you want to say to me now - because
you don’t have long.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Are you not paying attention or are you
delusional? You’ve broken every arms embargo written. There’s enough in
those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences. You’ll spend ten
years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your
time.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My family has disowned me. My wife and son
have left me. My brother is dead. Trust me, I fully appreciate the
seriousness of my situation. But I promise you I won’t spend a single
second in a courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You are delusional.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I like you, Jack. Well, maybe not. But I
understand you. You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been
rewarded. But you haven’t counted on the people who gave you that
badge.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: In the hall there will be a man who outranks
you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: First, he will compliment you on the fine job
you’ve done, how you’re making the world a safer place and then he is
going to tell you that I am to be released.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You are going to protest, you will probably
threaten to resign.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But in the end I will be released.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The reason I’ll be released is the same reason
you think I will be convicted. I do rub shoulders with the most vile,
sadistic men calling themselves leaders today. But some of those men are
the enemies of your enemies.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I would tell you to go to hell. But I
think you’re already there.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What if I’m not? What if I sleep fine at
night? What if I sleep better than you? I think that’s what truly scares
you.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Most people are happy just to get out of jail.
I expect to be paid to leave.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m not a fool. I know that just because they
need me one day doesn’t mean they won’t make me a scapegoat the next.
But I was back doing what I do best.</p>
<p><strong>border officer</strong>: Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sun umbrellas.</p>
<p><strong>border officer</strong>: Have a safe trip.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: For someone who’s never fired a gun or been in
a battle, I have suffered many casualties in my life. I guess that’s how
I survived. I never went to war…</p>
