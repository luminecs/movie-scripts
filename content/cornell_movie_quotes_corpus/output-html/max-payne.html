<h1 id="max-payne">max-payne</h1>
<p><strong>c</strong>: I don’t believe in heaven, but I have this idea
about it. Something I heard in a song.</p>
<p><strong>max’s voice</strong>: Heaven is a place where nothing ever
happens.</p>
<p><strong>max’s voice</strong>: There’s an army of bodies under this
river. Criminals, people who ran out of time, out of friends.</p>
<p><strong>max’s voice</strong>: The next time they drag this river,
they’ll find me on the bottom with the rest of them. And there won’t be
anybody left to say I was different.</p>
<p><strong>max’s voice</strong>: I could feel the dead down there, just
below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me as one of their own.</p>
<p><strong>max’s voice</strong>: It was an easy mistake to make.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Hey, that’s a really nice watch.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Kinda reminds me of one I lost–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You didn’t lose it. You pawned it up on 128th a
few hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ask Doug. He was there with you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’ve been following us all night?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. I’m only following you.</p>
<p><strong>pawnshop</strong>: You a cop, or something?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pawnshop</strong>: Too bad. Go get my watch.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Watch over me, watch over me…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Open your eyes, now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Have you ever seen her before?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey
with William Preston three–</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Bill’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s why I’m talking to you. Did he ever say
anything about this woman? Did you ever hear anyone–</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Bill died because their wings couldn’t lift
him up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, he got shot robbing a liquor store. What
are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Their wings are golden, the feathers only look
black…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: You my new guy?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I didn’t think anybody was here.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: Everybody’s usually a little late.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: All the cold investigations in the city
are collected and delivered over to us. We call each witness to see if
they can add anything to their original statement.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: And if they can?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: We send the file back to the original
precinct for follow-up. Don’t get your hopes up, though.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: Once you’ve gone through the file and
come up empty, bring it here…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: Max here handles our filing. Once it
hits his desk, a case is officially dead.</p>
<p><strong>etective</strong>: What if there’s no phone number for a
witness? Should I follow up in person?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: Nope, we don’t do that down here.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I don’t understand, then how–</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: How do you solve that unsolvable murder
mystery and redeem yourself?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: The grand jury couldn’t find–</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: Stop. Trust me, there’s a tragic story
behind why I’m here giving you this tour. We all did something, so just
save it. Follow me to the break room…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: We should get a beer after work, or
something…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: So what did he do?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: emember when you were a kid, and you’d hold your
breath when you went past a graveyard?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. adams</strong>: ust…try to leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax walks up the street, brushing past HOMELESS
PEOPLE and FASHIONISTAS jostling for the same space on the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>oice</strong>: You can’t come here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: William Preston was a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You can’t come here, I said. I’m done
helping you. I’ve already… …paid my debt to society, you know? I’ve
cooperated enough.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We need to talk. Won’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I thought you found Bill’s partner.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I did, but Doug only wanted to talk about
pigeons, or something. I need a new name, someone robbing houses to feed
a habit around that same time.</p>
<p><strong>revor</strong>: Three years is a lifetime for guys like that.
One way or the other, they’re probably all gone now. Either way, I’m not
the one to ask anymore. I cater to a better class, now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: This is a party. These are my friends. You
remember friends?</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: I need another name, or I start frisking your
friends.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: don’t have one to give you, Max. Look,</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: ry sleeping at night every now and then,
you’d see that for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’d invite you in, but…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: hanks.</p>
<p><strong>atasha</strong>: ou decided to stay for a while.</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: ow it’s your turn to say something…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: Thank you. It’s… Shit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why don’t you let go–</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Mind your business.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold
of Max’s arm. Incredibly, he’s just as fast, slipping free of the grip
that would surely have snapped his wrist…</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: My sister. Sort of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You have to go. Now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fine. I just want to ask her something
first…</p>
<p><strong>atasha</strong>: Looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Were you in there?</p>
<p><strong>atasha</strong>: Take me somewhere, I’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: You just move in?</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: hree years ago. So we’re somewhere, now: who was
that guy–</p>
<p><strong>atasha</strong>: Fine. What was her name?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: The girl from the boring story you want
tell me. The one that ends with you living here. Very sad.</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: tell you what…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: That way you can make love to her again,
just like she never left you. Oh, Max, I miss you…</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: You should go.</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s nothing you can tell me.</p>
<p><strong>atasha</strong>: ou’re kicking me out of your bed?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: Owen, pick up if you’re awake…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: wind picks up, garbage blowing…</p>
<p><strong>natasha</strong>: ot yet! Please, just let me…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: LEX HILLMAN sits behind the wheel - about Max’s
age, but in much rougher condition, everything about him a little ashen.
He watches Max turn away from the office and move closer.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re not serious, are you?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hey’ve parked at a crime scene - the alley in
front of them sealed with police tape, COPS posted to keep onlookers
away.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I need you to look at something.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Her. Just one.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: omebody found her leg near the sidewalk,
called it in a few hours later. We found the other one in the dumpster
over there.</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>etective #1</strong>: Don’t tell me you two are gonna start
working together again. I’d–</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: What do we know?</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: Only that it didn’t happen here.
Beyond that, I don’t even know how to describe it in my report.
`Disassembled,’ that’s the word we came up with.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why are you showing me this?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We found it here, by her heart.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: As far as we know, the victim–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Natasha.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They couldn’t lift him up…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We need to talk, Max. Tonight. Here’s my
address…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: For God’s sake, I know where you–</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, I moved out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Alex? Are you in here?</p>
<p><strong>u</strong>: nseen behind Max’s back, the front door pushes
closed…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Alex!</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: nother reflection shows a set of eyes. Frozen.
Frantic. It’s Alex, staring at Max, seeming to silently beg for help.
Max looks from the reflection to the legs. There’s no way…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: The E.R. doctor’s old man was a patrolman in the
45th. I got him to get you a private room.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: our contact information was… pretty out of date,
you know, but one of the dispatchers remembered me and your dad riding
together back in the day.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Alex.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: he first unit to respond must’ve scared them
away before they could do the same thing to you. Pretty remarkable,
considering your luck.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He was trying to tell me something.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Was he alive when you showed up? Did you get a
look at the guys who–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. I get Bflashes, but it’s…wrong.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: I hate to say it, but you need to come up with
something better than that. They’ve got nothing for leads, so the whole
force has you pegged as the prime suspect.</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: You tell them where to find me.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: No need. The funeral starts in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: ust slow down. You need to–</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: What I need is to borrow some dress blues. Can
you help me out?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah. My office is on the way.</p>
<p><strong>.j.</strong>: –with a major system moving down from Canada
tonight, transportation authorities are bracing for a blizzard…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You quit working for Aesir?</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: I didn’t quit, they made me head of security for
the whole parent company. That comes with its own building, such that it
is. Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s a bullet hole.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah, from a musket ball. The British used this
place as a military prison during the Revolutionary War. Think about
that. It’s older than St. Paul’s.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax looks up at the crumbling gargoyles perched
above.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hen the weather isn’t so shitty, the view is
unbelievable. I’m not making any guarantees that any of this will
fit.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I saved one of those for you. Third page from
the back.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: hey’re going to set up some kind of scholarship
in her name.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: hey kept coming to me for suggestions over what
she might want. I guess since we go back so far, maybe they think I’m
family. Nobody knew how to find you… I said art. She liked art,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: t’s a nice thing, a scholarship. Good way to
remember somebody.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You still haven’t been out there, have you?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s a nice spot. I’ll go up there with you
after, if you want…</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Go ahead up and say something to Christa. I’ll
find us some seats…</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Let him through.</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: Christa, I’m really sorry about what–</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Don’t talk to me like some stranger.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Who did this to him, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We don’t have a lot, yet…</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: When everything happened to you, Alex
completely fell apart. He ruined his life, he cared that much. So what
are you going to do for him, now?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax could melt under those eyes, but Christa turns
her back and continues up the path to Alex’s waiting coffin.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Detective Payne?</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: .A. I need you to come with me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ow?</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: ow’d the girl have your wallet?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She stole it.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Like…picked your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: So you didn’t know she was a
prostitute?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, I didn’t. We met through a friend.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Trevor Duncan. He’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: That’s classy. You know what Trevor does
for a living, I assume?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He used to snitch for me.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: ell me, Max, what’s a glorified file clerk still
need a snitch for?</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: see. So you’d piss in a cup for us,</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I think you just said the magic words. Call once
you hear from the union lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: ou and Detective Hillman haven’t worked
together since your reassignment. What made you get back in touch?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He wanted me to help him with something.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s what I’m going to do.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: ook at this from my perspective: I’ve got
two bodies in ten body bags. You</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: were the last person to see either one…</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: And some of that blood is mine. Good luck with
your case.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Nice work, detective.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: You’ve been around long enough to know I’m
his only way out.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Well, I hope that felt good.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It makes you look guilty. You understand that,
right? Now it’s not just Alex’s unit that thinks you’re the guy…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You need friends on the force right now. There’s
only so much I can do outside…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>detective #2</strong>: God damn it, that means you need
a–</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax gives the knob a final twist, and the door
swings open.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There wasn’t ever a key.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What are you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he SLAMMING sounds outside push Max deeper into
the desk, frantically spilling the contents onto the floor…</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: ut on the street, the Man’s SCREAMS mix with the
howling wind. The Figure steps into the street, towards the alley…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Lose your dog?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: We need to talk about my sister.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: hoever killed your sister did the same thing to
my partner– It was the same person.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Yeah. You.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So stupid…</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You left your wallet lying beside her body.
Who’s stupid?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax slumps to the side, spitting out a stream of
blood…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Does that sound like something a Homicide cop
would get wrong?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know somebody named Owen?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Owen Green?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Natasha called him on her way out of my
apartment. Give me one day to–</p>
<p><strong>ona</strong>: No. Now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Somebody my sister used to hang around with.
Nice kid.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You better hope he backs your story up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have things I need to ask him, myself.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Owen, open up.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Open–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Owen?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax lowers his pistol - ready for anything, not
for this.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Owen?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Owen, wait…</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: is attention is torn from their reflections on
top of the glass by the spectres looming beyond it outside. Their claws
reach in, raking his body, pulling him closer…</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Make them stop, tell them I can’t fly…</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: What did we just see?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re sure this is the place?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Natasha had all her work done here.</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: Something I can help you with?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What if I wanted this tattoo?</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: Then you’re probably in the Marine
Corps.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This one.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: It’s a Norse superstition. The
Vikings used to wear them for protection.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Trust me, my sister had all the guardian
angels she needed.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: Not angels. Valkyries.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he Artist goes to a shelf bulging with old books
- his reference library. He searches through dusty volumes…</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: In Norse mythology, the only way you
get to go to heaven is to die in violence. Die in your sleep, you go to
hell. Valkyries fly over the battlefields, picking out the righteous
dead. They reward the people who draw first blood. A soldier’s
angel.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: I’m generally thrilled to have
referral business, but I tell people looking for those wings to find ink
closer to home.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Where’s home?</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: Some club down in Alphabet City.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Protection from what?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he pipes stop glowing, blackness replacing the
blue lights.</p>
<p><strong>pprentice</strong>: They see you…they see you…</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Do you know this guy?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Maybe it isn’t anything new. People get strung
out, act crazy…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You think they were both on something?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Crystal meth, maybe, some amphetamine that
raises your body temperature in an overdose. Explains why they were both
sweating like that, trying to cool off. Of course, a junky won’t usually
jump out the window if there’s someone left in the room to beg or
rob.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You were standing right beside me.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jumped is not the word I’d use.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he streets are more crowded there, people
shuffling towards that sign and the sounds of DARK MUSIC filtering from
inside.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: They all look…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like Owen.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This isn’t anything I’ve seen before.</p>
<p><strong>ona</strong>: You ever been to Rome?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Better cities than this one have fallen. This
is far enough.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Sorry about the chain.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: here’s some flicker of movement on the
rooftop…</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: or a moment, Max is caught between his desire to
protect the memento and to see what’s hidden inside. A deep breath…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It was sitting at this very table that your
father told me I needed to retire. For about a minute, I just sat here
thinking about knocking him out of his chair. The job was everything to
me, to the point that I couldn’t see the writing on the wall - what it
was doing to my marriage, my health. Your old man knew if I was going to
listen to reason, it</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: There’s nothing you can’t say in here. It’s like
hallowed ground.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I watched a guy throw himself out of a window
tonight. The things he was saying-</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Any guy who throws himself out a window, I
wouldn’t pay any attention to the things he said.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The problem is, I knew what he was talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I haven’t been really afraid of anything
since…that night.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: And you are now?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s something going on, and I can’t find a
rational explanation for it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s…something out there, hurting
people–</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Okay, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s real. I’m not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Then stop acting like it. Max, you’re breaking
into offices, I.A. is all over you, you won’t even show up for work…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The night Alex died, there was something else
in the room with us. I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: B goes a bit pale, smile fading as Max’s words
continue.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: It’s really important that you be careful how you
talk to people about this, okay? You’re already under suspicion–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s the same thing these people are seeing
right before they die. I think Michelle saw it, too.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: For God’s sake, don’t drag her into this.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What’s really going on here?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Alex found something out about what happened to
her. Something new.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: There’s no way. He would have told us.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He was trying, right before he died…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Listen, okay? Why don’t you come back with me,
let Beth make up the guest room for you. Just for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You need to take some time. Get some sleep, heal
up. See if it still feels real after that…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s real.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: elpless, BB can only bury his hands in his
pockets and watch Max fade away. After a moment, he pulls something
out…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You riding?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: If you’re coming, you better come on. Way
it’s looking, might be the last train tonight.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: dingy, dark bar on the first floor of an even
sleazier</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: In or out, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: We need to talk. Talk.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Shut the door, then. You Ruskies may be used
to it, but I’m freezing my dick off over here.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Okay. So talk.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Something was taken from me. It involves a
club in Italian territory, so I need your blessing to go make it
right.</p>
<p><strong>innie</strong>: You’re asking my permission? Well in that
case, sweetheart…</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I said `blessing.’</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Oh. Well, blessing might cost extra. Which
club are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Ragna Rok.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Over on Avenue–</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Yeah, I know. Sure, fine. You have my
permission…blessing, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You do still control that block, right? It’s
south of–</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: The guy’s name is Jack Lupino.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Well, that sounds Italian to me.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: He’s no kind of Italian I’ve ever seen.
Tattooed freak, a real sicko from what we hear.</p>
<p><strong>ona</strong>: You’re afraid of tattoos, now?</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: When the club first opened, I sent somebody
down to collect the…you know, fire insurance. A day goes by, and I don’t
see him. Then I get two boxes delivered to me. One box’s got my guy’s
hands and ears in it. The other box has a quarter of a million dollars
in cash.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: This neighborhood has been your family’s
forever. Two-fifty large is all it takes to–</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: What got my attention, Mona, was that the
boxes were delivered by a cop car. A guy in uniform hands them to me in
broad daylight. I’m not scared of tattoos, or freaks, or mouthy Russian
bitches. But whoever’s watching over Lupino, whoever it is you really
need to bless you walking inside Ragna Rok…him, I am scared of.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: She was thirty-five. The daughter, two months.
From what we could tell, it started out as a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: oth of the men had records, mostly bullshit -
possession, petty theft.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: ut that day…I don’t know. They had something
else on their minds.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: ax was maybe ten minutes late.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: regular home-cooked meals. Shave and a haircut.
Nice suit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Michelle!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Michelle?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Michelle, I’m right here…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: other keeps rushing, swinging a long knife at
Max’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>junkie</strong>: It’s okay. They’re angels, now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Michelle!</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ichelle huddles on the bed, baby wrapped tight in
her arms. Max rushes over to her, reaching out to touch her
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Michelle…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: We looked everywhere for the third guy, but
there was nothing to go on. Not a hair of him left behind.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: I called in a favor before I retired, had him
transferred to Cold Case while he dealt with the shock of it. I thought
it we were patient, gave him time, Max would come back to his old self
again.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Look, I called you because I thought I recognized
something in you. I thought if we could talk off the record–</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: This isn’t just some job stress freak- out. This
is a man who lost everything, and who deserves a little understanding
from the rest of us. If you’d known him before… You’d want to believe
him, too.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Believe him about what?</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Are you saying you think Max did have
something to do with Alex’s murder?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Absolutely not. Alex was his partner, they were
like brothers…he couldn’t have. There’s no way.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Then what are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Look, Max is like a son to me. Don’t put me in a
position to have to hang him. But you should hear the kinds of things
he’s saying…hallucinations, none of it makes any sense to me. I’m
worried he’s going to get into another situation before I can convince
him to come in.</p>
<p><strong>ravura</strong>: Are you telling me he was–</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m telling you to find him tonight, before
somebody else gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Is there anything we can do to help you bring
him in? Unofficially, of course…</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Bringing him in won’t be a problem. Where I
need your help will be his–</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>ravura</strong>: A New Jersey unit ID’d him near his old
house. It shouldn’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You have to find him first, protect him. Some of
the guys from Alex’s unit beat you to him, they won’t wait for a
trial.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: neatly labeled with feminine script.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, Chelle. Help me, here…</p>
<p><strong>oice</strong>: Stay where you are!</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: with panic. He assumes an awkward, textbook
firing position.</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: Relax, I’m a cop.</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Don’t move! I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just relax. I need you to trust me for a
minute…</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Yeah? Is that what you said to your
partner?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Lay down on your face.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, just take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Word’s gotten around about the sick shit
you did to him, too. If I were you, I’d get ready for sort of a long
ride back into the city…</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol
away.</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: ootsteps ECHOING, he reaches the desk and waits
for a beat.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: We have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Subjects?</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: tartled voices MURMUR. Windows that had been
black glow to life as the passengers’ eyes adjust to the dark car…</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.
The storm’s caused a power failure, but it’s absolutely nothing to worry
about. We’ll be up and running again before long.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax splits his attention between the other
passengers and the window, watching for more movement outside…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get out of the train.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get out–</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: B turns, startling as Max steps out of the
shadows - steps stiff with pain, clothes dripping icy water across the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Max? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Those grunts who went crazy in Iraq?</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: Go a little further, read what they did to the
bodies. It’s the same as what happened to Alex and that girl.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s all in her notes: people describing
fevers, hallucinations…their lymph nodes swell until their necks bruise
like something’s been choking them. The angels they all talk about?
Michelle talks about eye spasms that make things seem to flutter. Mixed
with the other delusions, that starts looking like wings… She wasn’t
seeing them. She was trying to figure out why other people were.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: thought she was working on allergy</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: Somebody at Aesir knows what–</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s me. I killed Alex.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He came to me about six months ago, asking about
one of the executives at Aesir. At the time I had no reason to connect
it to Michelle, I just thought… I tried to warn him, this guy has
connections to some scary people–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who? What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Jason Colvin. He used to be the head of the
pharmaceutical division, but he’s moved up over the last few years. I
guess Michelle probably reported directly to him…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: ou’ve got copies of this stuff, right?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: e careful, Max.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: ETECTIVES wander between yellow tarps in the
train, sipping coffee. Out on the tracks, Bravura works alone.</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: Looks like ten bodies, give or take.
Even in New York, that ought to be enough to earn Payne the spike.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: The blast point is outside the train.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: ased on the spread of the wreckage… they
moving very fast, either.</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: He forced them to stop, first.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: So he had the bomb with him inside, but he
decided to walk outside to detonate it?</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: Are you asking if that seems like odd
behavior from a guy who cut his partner’s head off?</p>
<p><strong>oung cop</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: Careful what you say to him, if you
ever want to make detective…</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: I already filled out a report.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Show me where it happened, then.</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: He jumped out and wrapped that cord
around me, and before I had a chance…</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: He was coming out of here?</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: Hey, real cops are working here…</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Where’s the stuff you guys moved?</p>
<p><strong>csi tech</strong>: Nothing’s been moved.</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: What, you playing detective now?</p>
<p><strong>ravura</strong>: This is his wife?</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: spent four hours up at Homicide going</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: If Alex was getting a little something
on the side–</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Who are you protecting?</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: Nobody, we just…why would anybody talk
to IA without a reason?</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: You’ve got a reason, now. Tell me
everything you know about this woman, starting with her name.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Jason Colvin steps out of a cab and marches up
the steps.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: You should go on home, already. There’s
nothing going on today…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Well, there’s someone in your
office…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This your daughter?</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Yes, it is. Three years old.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Is there something I can help you with,
detective?</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: You can tell me about Project Valhalla.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: I think you might have the wrong…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: eed to make a call?</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Maybe I’d better.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Yes, there’s a detective here… What did you
say your name was?</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: She was my wife.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Michelle Payne was my wife.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: What–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Before you say anything else, I want you to
know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Please, wait…</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: I need to talk to somebody about a woman
who used to work here.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Please don’t hit me again.</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: A week ago, I thought the universe had turned
against me. Everything I loved was gone, and for some reason I’d been
left here to suffer alone.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ut it wasn’t the universe that took my family
away from me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell me about Valhalla.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: There is no–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: There’s no Project Valhalla anymore. I shut
it down years ago.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: It was a disaster. The drug was so
addictive, the damage it did to the mind was so devastating that we lost
our government funding. By the end, we couldn’t even guarantee the
safety of our scientists administering the experiment. Test subjects
would follow them home and kill them for an extra dose.</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: Is that what happened to Michelle?</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Nobody knows what happened to her.</p>
<p><strong>olvin</strong>: People thought Michelle might be a
whistle-blower. That she wasn’t loyal enough to Aesir, and she might go
public about the program.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Authorized personnel only.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Don’t look at him. Move aside.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: ’m authorized.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Why are you asking me about this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I already told you. Be quiet, now.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: But why today? It’s over, I got rid of
everything before they moved me out of the division–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then you haven’t been Downtown lately, because
you missed a spot.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Are you telling me that there are people out
there taking the drug again? How many of them?</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: I knew it, I knew something was going on. I
told her the numbers were too good–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Colvin, are you okay in there? Security’s
on its way…</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: They’re not coming for you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>olvin</strong>: You only know my name because somebody high
up decided to cut me loose. There’s a safe in the wall. It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Show that to whoever will watch. If this
thing spreads, nothing will keep the rest of you safe.</p>
<p><strong>colvin</strong>: Wait, I’m not ready…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Back up, all of you. Make a path.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stay back, or I’ll–</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he crowd goes crazy, SCREAMING and trampling each
other… More SHOTS ring out, ripping through Colvin as Max lets his
lifeless body fall and hides his retreat in the scramble…</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: This is Jim Bravura, IA. You need to tell
the units responding to the Aesir call to come equipped for automatic–
The Aesir building, nobody’s called anything in yet? Hell yes, I’d like
to report something. We’ve got machine gun fire in Midtown.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax gets a few careful SHOTS off from his new
elevation, dropping Guards who’ve lost sight of him as he jumps from
desk to desk, working deeper into the maze of cubicles…</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Put your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: You need to come in now, before anything
else gets pinned on you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She was trying to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Stop what? Tell me what’s happening–</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hile Max scrambles for cover, Bravura charges
forward, waving his badge in the air above him.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: NYPD! Hold your fire!</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Hold your fire!</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: You need to see this.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: From the beginning of time, great
generals have all wrestled with one undeniable truth - morale wins
battles.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Fear, fatigue, loss of focus…the future
of combat medicine lies in the mind of the soldier.</p>
<p><strong>nnouncer</strong>: Thanks to breakthroughs made by Aesir
Pharmaceuticals, the military of tomorrow will be able of unlock the
limitless potential inside every soldier.</p>
<p><strong>h young soldier</strong>: ow has my experience in combat
changed since being selected for Project Valhalla? I’m never scared, for
starters.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: That’s the guy.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: He’s the one behind Ragna Rok. It’s his club
where the drug’s being sold.</p>
<p><strong>lupino</strong>: You face down a group of insurgents and
instead of fear, you’re filled with…peace, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>lupino</strong>: Like you’re aware of the power you have in
your own hands to make the world a better place.</p>
<p><strong>ona</strong>: So what do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: What are you doing? Uncuff me. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>w mona</strong>: hat is this? You think just because he
killed your partner, you can decide whether I–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He killed my wife.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I’ve been inside that club. You don’t have a
chance on your own. But you don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You don’t want my help, because you think if
he puts you out of your misery, you’ll get to see her again.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I hope that’s really the way it works.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: nto a bent spoon, Lupino taps greenish powder
from a small glass vial. He uses the candle to heat the spoon. Checking
his watch, one of the guards produces a cell phone and dials.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: All quiet, 4 a.m.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Screw this…</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: ait here, Mr. Lupino.</p>
<p><strong>upino</strong>: I don’t need protection. I have my own.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ax melts out of the smoke, weapon raised.
Hunting.</p>
<p><strong>lupino</strong>: an you hear them, now?</p>
<p><strong>lupino</strong>: We’ll see which one us they’re flying for.
We’ll see who they love best.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who is your contact at Aesir?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who sent you after Michelle?</p>
<p><strong>upino</strong>: You are so blessed.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ou don’t know what I’m talking about, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>lupino</strong>: The angels are not done with you yet.</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: What’s going on here, BB?</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: t ease, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Not unless you feel like carrying him out of
here. Max knows me, and I definitely don’t know Mr. Lupino.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look at me, BB. At least face what you’re
doing…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: row up.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Happy New Year.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: I hope you’re not over there blaming me. Really,
this is Michelle’s fault.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: She had no right to put me in that situation.
Asking me to pass up this kind of an opportunity to help her rat out my
bosses…I’m sorry, but that’s unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: But then again, who could blame her for getting
confused, being married to such a righteous man. So maybe it is your
fault, after all. Just like your old man. Always knew you were better
than everyone else–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. Just better than you.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: For what it’s worth, he didn’t know Michelle was
going to die.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He thought they were going out there to scare
her, destroy her research.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’d arranged with the other guys to finish the
job.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He locked them out of the bedroom, tried CPR…boy
scout shit.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: And as thanks, you nearly blew his head off
while he crawled out the window.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: B watches eagerly, waiting for what comes
next…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: That’s funny, to me.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You really didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>ax</strong>: You should have killed me then, when you had a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I learned something from your father, years ago.
Always give people a choice.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He gave me the choice between early retirement
or facing the charges he was going to bring against me. He sat me down
in that bar and explained that I could either give up the thing I loved,
or I could have it taken away by force. That</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You could have put a gun in your mouth any time
you wanted. Or, you could have kept living in the hell I made for you.
That’s your choice.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Just out of curiosity, though: why don’t I have
a chance now?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Because now I know it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Well, you’re–</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: Okay, enough. This is far enough.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: ’ve got something better.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: B motions for Max and Joe Salle to follow him out
onto the pier, its planks buried under a thick sheet of ice.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Grab me some of that rope.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s not like we didn’t see it coming.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Sullen, withdrawn…Max just never seemed the same
after the tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s a good thing his father didn’t live to see
it, though. Bill Payne’s only son, a strung-out suicide.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It would have eaten him alive.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bravura’s not going to buy it.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Sure? Not even once the autopsy turns up traces
in your blood?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: dosed you that night at Alex’s, just to</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: oe, why don’t you calm down…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s fine, as cold as that water is… Just in
case, though. Make sure.</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: stepping quiet, past the bloody and motionless
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Are you home?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he CAPTAIN steps out onto deck, zipping his coat
against the weather while talking into a two-way radio. Faintly visible
around him, larger ships are outlined by twinkling lights.</p>
<p><strong>aptain</strong>: You know how blind I am, I’m not crashing
into the dock again. When the power–</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: ang on a second.</p>
<p><strong>aptain</strong>: Jumpers.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: oly shit… Somebody get out here!</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: It’s too late. He’s frozen solid.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Somebody get some blankets.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: all the cops, he’s bleeding everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: on’t move. We’ve got help coming.</p>
<p><strong>irst mate</strong>: What is that? What’s he…</p>
<p><strong>aptain</strong>: Great, a junkie bleeding on my boat.</p>
<p><strong>an</strong>: He doesn’t really feel that bad…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What do you mean, he’s a block of ice…</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: Maybe it’s a fever already.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Let him go, then.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Okay. Again, from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>u ranking officer</strong>: nder what authority are you
interrogating these men?</p>
<p><strong>ravura</strong>: An investigation into departmental
corruption. They’re material witnesses–</p>
<p><strong>ranking officer</strong>: Just between you and me, I wouldn’t
count on these men being any kind of witnesses at all. I served with a
few of them, and remember what kind of officers they were.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: What kind would that be?</p>
<p><strong>ranking officer</strong>: Cops. Real cops.</p>
<p><strong>ranking officer</strong>: o offense.</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: None taken. Agent Taliente, I’d like you to
meet a real cop.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Let me talk to BB.</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: What’s going on downtown?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Bravura called in the Feds.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: or God’s sake, come on. Max is dead, they’ve got
nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Get up to the armory, hide the–</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: He’s not dead. He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Bullshit. There’s no way–</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: Who are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Her.</p>
<p><strong>nicole horne</strong>: This isn’t a number you use.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: need you to send a helicopter to my</p>
<p><strong>nicole horne</strong>: here was a shoot-out in my building
yesterday, twenty floors from where I’m sitting. A secretary was
killed.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I understand an executive named Jason Colvin was
also among the dead. Senseless tragedies, all.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Everything’s fine, we’re just–</p>
<p><strong>nicole horne</strong>: This was more than you were ready
for.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>nicole horne</strong>: Perhaps our partnership has run its
course.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Think pretty hard about that. I’m about to be
surrounded by Federal agents–</p>
<p><strong>nicole horne</strong>: Good heavens, BB. Best of luck.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Who needs luck? They’re going to love the
stories I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>nicole horne</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Send the helicopter, then.</p>
<p><strong>nicole horne</strong>: It’s on its away.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Take everybody and get downstairs. I want no
less than his head.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: uddenly, an office down the hall bursts to life -
a ROAR of flapping wings, light from the window strobing with
movement.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Take some C4, wire it so he can’t make it to the
roof. I’ll wait on the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know I won’t leave without you.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Max!</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I’ll do what I can to slow them down, but you
have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You’re not done yet.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: The weather’s broken, your pilot is going to
have no problem landing.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Where’s the detonator?</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: There’s more like this all over. Even if
the building doesn’t collapse, this floor is gone. Careful with that
thing, is what I’m saying. I’m sure you and I can work something
out.</p>
<p><strong>uards</strong>: Drop your weapon!</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: Hurry, Max’s already upstairs. Just hand
it over.</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: B’s done for, but this thing doesn’t have
to stop. I’m his number two, and somebody has to take over for Lupino.
Like I said, we can work something out.</p>
<p><strong>joe salle</strong>: Give me one reason we can’t do
business.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he window Max stands in front of SHATTERS in the
EXPLOSION, his demonic image bursting into a thousand shards of
glass…</p>
<p><strong>bravura</strong>: Try to take Payne alive, if there’s
anything left.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s unbelievable. All that snow, and… Watch it
end up being a beautiful day.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You want my confession, first? You came all this
way for it…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Forgive me, Max, for I have sinned. I should
have bet more on you, and less on that helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Just get to it, already. That’s all I ask.
You’ve earned it, so just…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: But I want you to listen to me, first. Just try
to hear what–</p>
<p><strong>max’s voice</strong>: I don’t believe in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>max’s voice</strong>: But I have this idea about it.</p>
