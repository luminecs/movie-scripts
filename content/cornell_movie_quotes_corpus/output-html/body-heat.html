<p><strong>third draft</strong>: October 6, 1980</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: My God, it’s hot. I stepped out of the
shower and stared sweating again. … It’s still burning? Jesus, it’s
bigger! And I thought you were making me hear those sirens. What is
it?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The Seawater Inn. My family used to eat
dinner there twenty-five years ago. Now somebody’s torched it to clear
the lot.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: That’s a shame.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Probably one of my clients.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It’s four a.m.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I go on duty at Miami Airport at seven.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I wouldn’t mind having breakfast… What do
you care? You’re watching the fire. You’re done with me. I’m just
getting into my uniform here…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You’ve had your fun. You’re spent. I’ll just
slip into my uniform here and slip away.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: My history’s burning up out here.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Hey, I don’t mind. I’m leaving. Why do they
make these damn skirts so hard to zip…</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Where’s your hat?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Hey… hey… … don’t wrinkle it!</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: ‘You’re spent.’ Where’d you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>judge costanza</strong>: Mr. Racine, I do no longer care
whether these alleged toilets were</p>
<p><strong>judge costanza</strong>: ever actually en route from Indiana
or not. I think we’re wasting our time here. It’s pretty clear your
client has attempted to defraud the county in a not very ingenious
manner. The Assistant Prosecutor has made what I consider a generous
offer. And given that you’ve failed to generate even the semblance of a
defense –</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Judge Costanza, perhaps when I’ve presented
all –</p>
<p><strong>judge costanza</strong>: Yeah, yeah. If I were you, I’d
recommend to your client that held quickly do as Mr. Lowenstein here has
suggested – plead nolo contendre, file Chapter Eleven and agree never to
do business with Okeelanta County again.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You would look favorably on that?</p>
<p><strong>judge costanza</strong>: He can walk. But don’t test my
patience for even five more minutes. If he hesitates, I’ll nail him.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ll talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>judge costanza</strong>: Mr. Racine. Next time you come into
my courtroom I hope you’ve got either a better defense or a better class
of client.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Thank you, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: – I think I’ve underestimated you, Ned.
I don’t know why it took me so long. You’ve started using your
incompetence as a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: My defense was evolving. You guys got
scared. Costanza doesn’t like me. What’d I do to him?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: He’s an unhappy man, Thinks he should be
Circuit Court by now. Here he is in a state with really top-notch
corruption and he’s stuck with the county toilets. I’m surprised you
weren’t in on that toilet caper. Could have been that quick score you’ve
always been searching for.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Maybe Costanza was in on it. That’s why he
was mad.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What’s the word from the hallowed halls of
justice? Anything juicy?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Maybe Stella was in on it. Stella, when
you gonna get a real air conditioner in here.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You don’t like it there’s lots of other
places.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: They don’t have you. Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: You can’t buy me. No sirree, I don’t
come cheap.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Lowenstein, you’re a fag.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Why does he do that?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: He’s pretty good, that’s the weird part.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Did you hear about Dr. Block?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No. Do I want to?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Agnes Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That must have been Mrs. Block’s idea, some
kind of punishment.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: It was! How’d you know? Christ, you’re
plugged in better than me. So you must know about Mrs. Block’s friend in
Ocean Grove.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Stella, this is beneath even you. Things
must be slow.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: It’s the heat.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Mrs. Singer, I would have gladly come to the
house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singer</strong>: No. no, the doctor says I should walk
and I had some shopping. Not that that quack knows what he’s talking
about. I tell you, Mr. Racine, I’m not sure his testimony is going to be
very useful.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I’ll find you a doctor
who’s more understanding. Is it bad today?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singer</strong>: Oooh, you can’t imagine. Nothing can
make up for the pain they’ve caused me.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How well I know. We’ll sue those reckless
bastards dry. Excuse my language.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singer</strong>: Don’t apologize. That’s the kind of
attitude you’ve got to have these days…</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You can stand here with me if you want, but
you’ll have to agree not to talk about the heat.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m a married woman.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Meaning I’m not looking for company.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Then you should have said – ‘I’m a happily
married woman.’</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: That’s my business.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: How happy I am.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: And how, happy is that?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You’re not too smart, are you?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I like that in a man.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What else you like – Ugly? Lazy? Horny? I
got ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You don’t look lazy.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Tell me, does chat like that work with most
women?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Some. If they haven’t been around much.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I wondered. Thought maybe I was out of
touch.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How ’bout I buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I told you. I’ve got a husband.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ll buy him one too.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He’s out of town.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: My favorite kind. We’ll drink to him.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He only comes up on the weekends.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m liking him better all the time. You
better take me up on this quick. In another forty-five minutes I’m going
to give up and walk away.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You want to buy me something? I’ll take one
of these.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Cherry.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Make it two.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’re not staying in Miranda Beach. I would
have noticed you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Is this town that small?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Pinehaven. You’re staying up in Pinehaven,
on the waterway. You have a house.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You look like Pinehaven.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: How does Pinehaven look?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Well tended.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes, I’m well tended, all right. Well tended.
What about you?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Me? I need tending. I need someone to take
care of me. Rub my tired muscles. Smooth out my sheets.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Get married.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I just need it for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Good. Nice move, Matty.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Matty. I like it. Right over your heart.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: At least it’s cool. I’m burning up.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I asked you not to talk about the heat.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Would you get me a paper towel or something?
Dip it in some cold water.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Right away. I’ll even wipe it off for
you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You don’t want to lick it?</p>
<p><strong>pinehaven</strong>: Please drive carefully”</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Look who’s here. Isn’t this a
coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I know you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You’re the one that doesn’t want to talk
about the heat. Too bad. I’d tell you about my chimes.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: The wind chimes on my porch. They keep
ringing and I go out there expecting a cool breeze. That’s what they’ve
always meant. But not this summer, This summer it’s just hot air.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Do I remind you of hot air?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks.
Another?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What are you doing in Pinehaven?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m no yokel. Why, I was all the way to
Miami once.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: There are some men, once they get a whiff of
it, they’ll trail you like a hound.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m not that eager.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What is your name, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Ned Racine.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Matty Walker.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes. My temperature runs a couple degrees
high. Around 100 all the time I don’t mind it. It’s the engine or
something.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Maybe you need a tune-up.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Don’t tell me – you have just the right
tool.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t talk that way.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: How’d you find me, Ned?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: This is the only joint in Pinehaven.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: How’d you know I drink?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You seemed like a woman with all the
vices.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You shouldn’t have come. You’re going to be
disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: A lot of them have tried that seat. You’re
the first one I’ve let stay.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You must come here a lot.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Most men are little boys.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Maybe you should drink at home.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Too quiet.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Maybe you shouldn’t dress like that.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: This is a blouse and a skirt. I don’t know
what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You shouldn’t wear that body.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I don’t like my body much. It’s never been
right.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Sometimes, I don’t know. I get so sick of
everything, I’m not sure I care anymore. Do you know what I mean,
Ned?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I know that sometimes the shit comes down SO
heavy I feel like I should wear a hat.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I think I’ll get out of here now. I’m going
home.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ll take you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I have a car.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ll follow you. I want to see the
chimes.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You want to see the chimes.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I want to hear them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: That’s all. If I let you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m not looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I mean it. I like you. But my life is
complicated enough.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: This is my community bar. I might have to
come here with my husband some time. Would you leave before me? Wait in
your car? I know it seems silly…</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t know who we’re going to fool. You’ve
been pretty friendly.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Now leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Lady, you must be some kind of crazy!</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Remember your promise.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Just like my place.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No help?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: She goes home nights.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’re not nervous alone?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You do have chimes.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: A gazebo</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No, out there.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Boat house.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What is in there?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Boat.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: It’s a mess. There’s a row boat, a lot of
lounge chairs… things like that.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I think you should go now.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I just got here.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You’ve seen them. Please go.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You didn’t bring me here to see your wind
chimes.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes, I did. I said what I meant. Do you ever
do that?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No. not very often.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t think you want me to go.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes… Please.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: There’s nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: There is for me.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Thank you. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have lot
you come.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’re not so tough after all, are you?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No… I’m weak.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s right… that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Please, please …</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I didn’t want this to happen. But I didn’t
try hard enough to stop it… Because I wanted you. I wanted you here,
like this … This is bad for me. I know it. Now nothing’s going to be the
same anymore.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I like this place. It’s got a nice feel.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You were on top.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: So it could use a better mattress. See to
it, will you?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hey, gimme a break here. It takes a little
while.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: It’s your fault.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It takes me a good thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Are you sure? I just want to make sure
here.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Jesus, I think you’re right – – you better
be on the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No, you misunderstood – – this is my new
saddle, and I just want to –</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Wow! No, I must object –</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ve got to wash these.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’re afraid of your maid?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: That’s right. My mother told me “knowledge is
power.”</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: This is an interesting interpretation. Is
that why you’ve started smoking my brand?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No one must know. Promise me, Ned. No
one.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hey, lady, wanna make love?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe This sure is a
friendly town.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You are? You mean the offers no good?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I feel like a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Maybe you were supposed to deliver it next
door? You must be looking for the lady of the house.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you crazy, lady? Didn’t you hear the
siren?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Ned, this is Mary Ann.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: We were just meeting. Ned made me feel
very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m an idiot. Nice to meet you. Are you
staying in town?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No, no, just passing through. Nice area. A
little hot for my tastes.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It’s unusual. We’re famous for our cool
breezes.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Do you want to stay for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Got to go, got to go.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You two have fun now.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I didn’t see her car. I’m sorry. I got to be
more careful.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Mary Ann’s an old friend. She’s like a sister
to me. She wants me to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You know, this has never been one of my
pleasures. Car. I considered the time I spent making it – – like this …
penance for some sin.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What sin?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I never knew. Maybe worshipping women
instead of God. But it never did anything for me.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Not even a Mercedes? With genuine calf skin
upholstery?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Not this?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’re killing me.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Is there any more ice? I’m burning up.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He’s coming up tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I can’t stand the thought of him… He’s small
and mean… and weak.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Just do what I say! Go into the living
room.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Come on! It’s been three days. I want to see
you –</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m going to make it up to you tonight. But
you must behave. Now go!</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m going. I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Good evening, sir… welcome to… to Flight 413
… nonstop to …</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What do you take me for?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Don’t you like it?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You think I’m a kid?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You don’t like it? I thought you went for
this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Wait … wait … I want to tell you about the
thing… the thing that will drop from the ceiling… in case the cabin
suddenly depressurizes – oho…</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Listen!</p>
<p>****: I love that sound.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I want to be in bed.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Is that all you ever think about?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hey! I’m kidding.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes … that’s all I ever think about … You and
me. Your body near mine, close. I’m not right when you’re not with me. I
get the shakes. And each time, when I first see you, I shake even more.
For a while. And then I get calm. I feel safe … I’ve never been this
way. I can’t remember how I lived before.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You look terrible. Don’t you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I had a dream last night that was so
boring it woke me up. I was afraid to go back to sleep. Where the hell
have you been?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What do you mean, I been around.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I’ve barely seen you for a month. Wait a
minute – it’s some new quiff, isn’t it? What’s wrong with me.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: You’ve never been shy about that
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hey. You weren’t at the Y last week. We
lost.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: He’s getting discreet. I can’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Whatcha got in pie today, Stella?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Cherry, cherry… and cherry.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What do you recommend?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I like the cherry.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bring it on. And a gigantic Coke.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I’m really disappointed, Racine. I’ve
been living vicariously off you for years. If you shut up on me, I’ll
have just my wife.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: There’s nothing to tell. I lead a lonely
life.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Right. And it’s gonna snow later today –</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: … And people are basically decent.. …
Must be someone I know. Let’s see – someone in uniform…</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: …no Army personnel around. Waitress…
Could it be… …Stella!</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I know, I know – you finally got to
Glenda.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: How was it? Did she let you into the no
parking zone?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I’ll have you know Glenda is seriously
involved with a narc from Palm Beach.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: A narc from Palm Beach? Is that his
hobby?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How’s the cop business, Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Real good. Always starts hoppin’ in weather
like this. When it gets hot, people try to kill each other.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: It’s true. I could tell you some people
who’ll be dead if we don’t get a break soon.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We’ve got more of everything bad since the
wave started. It’s the crisis atmosphere. People dress different, feel
different, sweat more. They wake up cranky and they never recover. Look
at Lowenstein. Things are just a little askew. Pretty soon people think
the old rules aren’t in effect. They start breaking them. Figure no
one’ll care, cause it’s emergency time… time out.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Oscar, I just don’t understand how you
could be doing advanced theoretical thinking like that and still be
stuck working in our little town.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Lowenstein dreams of bigger things.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Assistant County Prosecutor isn’t the
end for me, fellows.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hell, no. Someday – Deputy County
Prosecutor.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: When the truth comes out about some of
the dirt I’ve been involved in,</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: my future in this state will be
unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: Hello, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hi, Glenda.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Don’t say it, if you don’t mean it. Please,
Ned, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I do. I want you with me.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m going to tell Edmund I want a divorce. I
won’t stay any longer. I would have, if you hadn’t come along. The life
is comfortable. I was willing to go on. But you’ve reminded me of what
it can be… I know now that these last three years I’ve been living half
a life. It’s my fault, I don’t deny it. You have to let yourself be
bought. I did. I let it happen. I’ve lived so much of my life with
nothing. When you have no money, you have no choices. I don’t care what
they say – money is freedom. That’s something they don’t teach you in
school. But I found out. And when Edmund came along when I saw a chance
to stop struggling I took it. I’m not ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He got what he wanted… he has a knack for
that. But no more. I’m ready to walk away from the money. I have to be
with you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It is conceivable I’ll make a buck
someday.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Oh, I know you will, darling. I didn’t mean
that. I know you will. But it doesn’t matter. It’s you I want. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Anyway, you’ll come out all right.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Of the divorce?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah. He’s ripe.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No. I signed a pre-nuptial agreement.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He insisted. He blamed it on his sister Roz –
she’s always hated me – but I know he wanted it too.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How is it?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Bad. I get some money for a year. Not much.
That’s it. But I don’t care, Ned. Not if I can be with you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Does it matter, Ned? Tell me the truth
please. I’ll understand, I swear to you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The truth? I wish you were going to be
loaded. Does it matter? No. No.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: God, you’ve made me happy. It’s time for your
present.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: From now on, when it starts coming down on
you, I’ll be there to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Put it on! I’ll bet I guessed the size
right.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Look in my eyes. Can you see yourself?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Big weekend planned?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Nope, Small weekend. Tiny little
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: There’s jazz tonight at the beach… if
you’re not doing anything…</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Beverly, do yourself a big favor and forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Forget what?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Whatever you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Come to me.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No… I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Okay, I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I saw the will once. He showed it to me. He
was trying to prove something … how much he loved me or something.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How’d he get so fat?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: The stock market, investments, real estate.
He doesn’t tell me anything, but I’ve picked up a little. I know they
own a lot of land along the shore here.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Who’s “they”’</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He’s never introduced me to anyone. I’m not
sure if they’re all legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I wonder what they call themselves. Maybe
I’ve heard of them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: They own that old place in Miranda Beach, The
Breakers… I know that.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The Breakers? I thought Hermie Fisher owned
that land.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Edmund mentioned it once.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Ned, it scares me to talk about these
things.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Let’s just not, okay? Let’s not think about
all he’s got.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What is it, Matty? Tell me exactly what
frightens you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m afraid… because when I think about it, I
wish that he’d die. That’s really what I want. It’s horrible and ugly
and It’s what I most want.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s where we’re at, isn’t it, Matty?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s what we’re both thinking – how good
it’d be for us if he were gone. It’d be real sweet for us.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Don’t talk about it, Ned. Please don’t. Talk
is dangerous. Sometimes it makes things happen, it makes it real.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Don’t let it scare you. Because he’s not
gonna die. There’s nothing wrong with him, is there? There’s no reason
to think he’s gonna die, is there?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s right. So we might as well forget
about it, It’s not gonna just happen to make things nice for us… It
won’t just happen.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m afraid, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Maybe that’s a smart way to be now, Matty.
Maybe we both should be.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The only thing wrong with your husband right
now… is us.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Well, well. Hello to you –</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Darling, I’d like you to meet Mr. Racine. I’m
sorry. I don’t know your first name.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Ned.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Edmund Walker. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you about.
You remember. He had a client who wanted to buy the house. I told him we
weren’t selling.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That hasn’t changed, has it?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: No, we’re very happy with it.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I can understand that. It’s a terrific
place.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Are you going in?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I was just going to grab a bite.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Join us.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No. Thanks very much, but I don’t want to
interfere with –</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Don’t be silly. Come on. We have room for
three, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I’ve heard this place is great. But you
can’t get near it on the weekends and I don’t get down during the week
much.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I was a lawyer. Still am, I guess. But I
don’t practice. Went to Columbia. You?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Good school. I got bored with it quick. I
guess I didn’t have the temperament. I wanted to make the money faster.
Is there a living in it here?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I can afford to send my shirts out. And eat
here once a month, if I don’t order an appetizer.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I figured an honest lawyer doesn’t make much
and the other kind was too slimy for me. I’d rather be upfront about
shafting somebody.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Edmund, really. It’s Mr. Racine’s
profession.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s all right. I don’t like it much.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What’s to like. That’s the way of the world.
Most people despise their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: No. I love it. But it’s not a job.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What is it, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Various things. This and that. Here and
there.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You don’t have to be specific.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Finance, basically. Venture capital,
Investments, real estate. We’re into a few things.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah? Around here?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Some. We own some things here.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Edmund’s company owns The Breakers.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It’s not that simple. We have an interest in
a few places along the shore. For the land. You know. Someday. There’s
no explaining it to her.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m too dumb. Woman, you know.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: She’s something, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: A lovely lady.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Yes, she is. I’m crazy about her. If I ever
thought she was seeing another guy… I don’t know. I’d understand how it
could happen. Her being the way she is. I’d understand it. But I think
I’d kill the guy with my bare hands.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s understanding.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You wouldn’t believe the dorkus she was with
when I met her. The guy came to us with a business proposition. We’re
always looking for opportunities. If the conditions are right. We’re
willing to take an occasional risk, if the downside isn’t too steep. But
this guy hadn’t done his homework, he didn’t know the bottom line.
That’s how I knew he was full of shit. You’ve got to know the bottom
line. That’s all that really counts.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: He didn’t have the goods, this guy. He was
like a lot of guys you run into – they want to get rich, they want to do
it quick, they want to be there with one score.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: But they’re not willing to do what’s
necessary. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m not sure. You mean, lay the groundwork?
Earn it?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: No. I mean do what’s necessary. Whatever’s
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah. I know that kind of guy. I can’t stand
that. It makes me sick.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m not like that.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: There are some messages on your desk. Be
back in an hour. Got to run.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Jesus! Did Beverly see you?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I waited till I saw her leave. Please don’t
be angry with me.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Angry? I’m not angry – How’d you get in?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: It didn’t lock. Oh. Ned, hold me. Please just
hold me, God, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He left this morning. I had to see you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I couldn’t call. I’m afraid to call. I was
afraid you wouldn’t let me come.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes, that’s right. You can’t call. Never
call. We have to be very careful now about the phone. The phone company
keeps records.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m careful. I hated it, Ned. I hated sitting
there with the two of you. I thought I was going to scream.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You did good. You’ve called my apartment
from the house.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No, never.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No? Those two times –</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I went to phone booths. I’m afraid of him,
Ned. I’m always afraid.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s good. We have to be careful about the
phones now.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Why, Ned, why do you say this now?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: We could account for a couple calls. We’ve
had some contact. That would make sense.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Why, Ned? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Because we’re going to kill him. We both
know that.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s what you want, isn’t it? We knew it
was coming. It’s the only way we can get everything we want, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The man’s gonna die for no reason but we
want him dead.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: He doesn’t deserve it. Let’s not ever say
that. We’re doing it for us. And you’re going to inherit half of
everything he owns. That’s what the will says, right?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s it then. We’re gonna kill him. And I
think I know how.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: It’s real, then?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah, it’s real all right, and if we’re not
careful, it’s gonna be the last real thing we do.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I know where he is. It’s not far from here.
I don’t want you with me.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I thought we settled that. I’ll wait in the
car, but – – I want to take the risks with you. We’re both doing
this.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Whatsa matter, you can’t think with a little
music? Like this, I said.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: It’s fast. It’s hot. It’s simple. You can use
the clock or rig it to something that moves. It starts big and it’ll go
with just the mag clips. If you want more, splash a little accelerator
around.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Just regular gasoline?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Regular, unleaded, supreme – whatever you
like, counselor. I got to tell you, though, this mama has a big
drawback.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: It’s easy to spot, even after the meltdown.
They’ll know it’s arson.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t care about that. That’s all there is
to it?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: No. No-no-no-no. That ain’t all there is to
it.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: You gotta get in, you gotta get out. You
gotta pick the right spot and the right time. And you gotta try not to
get famous while you’re in the act. If that was all there was to it, any
idiot could do it.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Hey, now I want to ask you something, Are you
listening, asshole, because I like you? I got a serious question for
you. What the fuck are you doing? This is not shit for you to be messing
with. Are you ready to hear something? See if this sounds familiar.
Anytime you try a decent crime, there is fifty ways to fuck up. If you
think of twenty-five of them you’re a genius. And you’re no genius. You
know who told me that?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Listen, man, maybe you should let me do it
for you. Gratis. I’ll do it. I wouldn’t even be on the street if it
weren’t for you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I hope you know what you’re doin’ you better
be pretty damn sure about it. If you ain’t sure, don’t do it. Of course,
that’s my recommendation anyway – don’t do it. Because I tell you,
Counselor, this arson, this is serious crime.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I don’t know why he’s so crazy about her.
Maybe because he never had any of his own. She’s a cute little girl, all
right, but other than that… I know this, though, her mother has worked
plenty hard to keep Heather on Edmund’s mind, Always bringing her
around, reporting everything she does in school. That Roz is a smart
one. And you know that anything Heather inherits goes straight to Roz.
Heather won’t even get a look at it. That’s the part I can’t stand.
That’s why it seems so wrong to have half of it go to her.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s the way it is. There’s nothing we can
do about it.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Are you sure, Ned? I’ve been thinking about
it. Maybe there is. The will is with his lawyer in Miami I know that.
What if I could get him to bring it home? He did it once, he’d do it
again. If I could swing it, couldn’t we rewrite it? Change it. Then when
he dies, I could find the new one. We could just change it a little.
Every little change would mean a lot to us, End. You’re a lawyer. You
know how to write it. It wouldn’t seem so odd. I could say he brought it
home and we talked about it and decided to make some changes up here.
And I knew you already –</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I just don’t see why Heather should take half
–</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Listen to me, Matty. Nothing strange can
happen in his life right now, not one thing out of the ordinary. That’s
vital, that’s the main thing. If anything does, the chances double that
we get caught. You and I are walking out there on the edge every second
now. One false move and we’re gonna fall off. It’ll be all over. You’ve
got to remember that all the time. You’ll get half of everything and
it’ll be plenty. No matter what it is, we’re gonna be satisfied. We’re
not gonna get greedy. If we do, we’ll get burned. You gotta believe me,
baby, the odds that we’ll get burned are good enough without looking for
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You’re right, darling. I’m sorry. I know
you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Okay. Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m just going for a ride. I wish it was all
this dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: The side door.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Two A.M. I send him down.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: We won’t talk again after I leave here
tonight. I’ll be in Miami by noon Friday. You won’t be able to reach me.
When I see you again, he’ll be dead.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m so frightened.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Hello, sweetheart. Have I got a nice present
for you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hi, Aunt Matty!</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Heather. What a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Jesus, take it easy. I thought I was
tense.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I can’t sleep. I’m going down and get
something to drink.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Edmund.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I can’t sleep, either.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Lock the door, darling.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You trying to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I’m going downstairs. Do you want
anything?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ll go down with you.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Christ, woman, did you ever hear of turning
on the lights?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Edmund… wait!</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Put on a robe or something. What if Heather
wakes up and comes down.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Damn. She’s not going to wake up at 2
o’clock in the morning…</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You don’t really mind, do you? Roz will pick
her up on Friday. And don’t worry, Roz won’t stay overnight.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: She can do whatever she wants.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Listen, I don’t know if I’ll be able to come
up next weekend. I’ll know more later. I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: My God, you scared me. You shouldn’t be here.
Heather’s still here. She’s upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: – Asleep.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I miss you so badly. But it’s too
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: She won’t wake up now.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You’re all wet.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ve been out there waiting for two
hours.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Aunt Matty?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Good morning, Aunt Matty. Hi, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Is there any more of that strawberry
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: She did.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Thank you, Aunt Matty.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Thanks, Matty. We appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Any time, Roz. She’s a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: It is me.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Why haven’t you answered your phone?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You took a chance coming here. Where’s
Edmund?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He’s not coming up this weekend. Why haven’t
you answered?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I didn’t want to talk. I just wanted to
think.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Can I get in with you?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I don’t know what Heather will tell Roz.
Maybe nothing. Maybe she’ll be embarrassed or afraid. Maybe she’ll think
she imagined the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Maybe we all did.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: We’ll know if she does tell. Roz will report
to Edmund quick enough. It’s exactly what she’s always wanted.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ve been thinking, too.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: And what have you got?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I think we should give it up. We haven’t done
anything criminal, yet.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It’s not too late to back out.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: That’s right. I don’t think we can do it.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Things have already started to go wrong. I
feel like we got to the edge and looked over and, well, it was too much.
We’ll just have to live with that.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ll divorce him. And we won’t have his
money. Part of me wants it so bad. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t. But
it’s the worst part of me, the weakest part.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: All that matters is that we’re together.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You don’t think I can pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: It’s not you, it’s us. I’m sure I’ll make
some mistake.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s not what you really mean, is it,
Matty?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No, it isn’t. You think he’s too much for
me. You think I’ll fuck it up, get us caught.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No, darling. Don’t talk that way. It’s not
true.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No? Well that’s what I’ve been thinking.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: You’re wrong. Don’t think that, ever! I know
you could do it. But all I care about is you. The money doesn’t
matter.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It does in this world, the one we’re living
in.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Why torture ourselves about it?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: When’s he coming back?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Friday.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’ll be it, then. Nothing will stop
us.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Is that what you really want? Are you
sure?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah. I wasn’t before, but I am now.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: This time you’re going to know how to reach
me. I don’t want any more surprises.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I think there’s someone downstairs I heard
something.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Should I call the police?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Will you be quiet? I’m going to nail the
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Edmund, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Will you be quiet?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ve never seen that.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I’ve got a surprise for this fucker.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Edmund, be careful!</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: He has a gun!</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The cars at the end of the drive. Spend the
fifteen minutes cleaning up inside, then come. You’re gonna have to be
careful in this fog. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>stocky trucker</strong>: Hey, man, do you have any
flares?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Uh – no. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>stocky trucker</strong>: Could you check your trunk? We got
kinda of a mess here.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t have them. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>stocky trucker</strong>: Don’t put yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Get the hell out of here and don’t come
back.</p>
<p><strong>ragged bum</strong>: Come on back here and fight like a
man!</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Thank god. I thought –</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: They’re right on time and I’m running
late.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: We won’t talk for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Ned. Miles Hardin. Do you want him?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: She says he’s a lawyer from Miami.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Ned Racine?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Miles Hardin calling.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Mr. Racine.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: This is Miles Hardin of Morris and Dale in
Miami.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: As you know, we represented Edmund
Walker.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Yes, well, Mrs. Walker has submitted the new
will you wrote up there.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes… I see.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: And frankly, Mr. Racine, I think we may have
a problem.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Uh-huh. What problem is that?</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Well, I’d rather discuss it in person. In
fact I think it might be best if we could all get together down there.
That is, if you wouldn’t object.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No no, that would be all right.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Good. We have a relationship with a firm in
West Palm – Shiller, Hastings.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I know of them.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: I’ve arranged to have the use of their
offices. I thought we might try to make it tomorrow, say ten o’clock.
Would that be possible for you?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Good. Mrs. Walker told me she would be back
down there by then.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: And I’ve asked Mrs. Kraft, Mr. Walker’s
sister, to join us, also. I’ll see you then.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Will you get me Mrs. Edmund Walker,
please.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I don’t have her. Should I?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I thought the temporary put her in. She came
in while you were on vacation. Look it up. They were in Pinehaven, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I get no answer at the Pinehaven
number.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Okay. Try again later.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Miles Hardin, Mr. Racine.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: I don’t think you know Mrs. Kraft.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No. I don’t. My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Mrs. Walker, I’m very sorry about your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Racine.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: You know Mr. Lowenstein.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hello, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Hi, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: I asked Mr. Lowenstein to join us because
he’s handling the inquiry into Edmund’s death for the County
Prosecutor’s office. He and I have discussed this matter and he’s made
is possible for us to speak very frankly here today. Off the record, so
to speak.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: As I’ve told Mrs. Walker, I was more than a
little surprised by the existence of this new will. Edmund hadn’t
mentioned anything about it to me.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Mrs. Walker explained to me that when she
and her husband decided to make some minor changes, they just took care
of it up here for simplicity’s sake. And, indeed, as you know, the new
will is almost identical to the old but for the disposition of a few
items. At the risk of oversimplifying, the thrust of the will is to
divide the estate in almost equal parts between Heather Kraft and
Mrs. Walker. Would you agree with that assessment, Mr. Racine?</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Mmmm. And you witnessed the signing by
Edmund Walker along with this Miss – – Mary Ann Simpson on July twenty-
first. Apparently, it will be impossible for us to contact Miss
Simpson.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Mary Ann is a lifelong friend of mine. She
happened to be visiting on her way to Europe. I’m sure when she returns
she’ll get in touch with me.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Although it’s certainly not required. The
witnesses to the signing of a will are not commonly available when the
will is entered into probate. It’s not standard by any means.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Edmund Walker’s death was not standard.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Pardon me. I’m sorry. I’m confused. Is there
some question about the authenticity of the will?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m confused, too. Do you have a problem
with the witnessing or the signatures? What is it you’re getting at?</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: No, there doesn’t seem to be any problem
here. This is Edmund Walker’s last will and testament. I’m afraid the
problem is elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Would anyone mind if I smoked?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I don’t need my own. I’ll just breathe
the air.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Everything’s in order up to there. The
problem comes in the language of the bequest to Heather. It’s a
technical matter.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: In writing the will, I’m afraid Mr. Racine
violated what’s known as “the rule against perpetuities.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: It’s a small thing, but it’s the law. It
forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations.
Many general practitioner lawyers don’t fully understand it. It doesn’t
come up much for them, because wills this complex are usually handled by
estate departments in larger firms. Handled by lawyers who specialize in
this type of work.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: I know this is terribly confusing, but if
you’ll bear with me… I spotted the problem right away, but since
Edmund’s intent was clear, I thought it in everyone’s best interest to
try and get the will admitted into probate anyway, even though it was
technically incorrect. I knew that a probate judge in Miami would spot
the mistake right away. That’s all they do all day, they’re expert. So I
thought I’d bring it up here to Okeelanta County – since Edmund had the
residence here – and see if I could get lucky with a judge who didn’t
know estate law quite so well… Perhaps find one with the same kind of
training as Mr. Racine.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Unfortunately, my plan backfired. I ran into
a judge who’d had other dealings with Mr. Racine. A Judge Costanza.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: In fact, it seems there were problems with
an estate in a case four years ago. Very different problems, it’s true.
But on a will Mr. Racine prepared. It was quite a mess. Accusations of
carelessness, a malpractice suit… I think he called it the Gourson
case?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Once again, Mr. Hardin, you’ve lost me.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Yes, what does all this mean?</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: It means, I’m afraid, that Edmund’s will is
invalid. Edmund Walker died interstate, as though there were no will at
all.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: So… what happens now?</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Perhaps Mr. Racine would like to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: In the state of Florida, when a person dies
without a will, and there are no children and no surviving parents, then
the spouse inherits everything.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: My god. You mean… it’s all mine?</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: Though that was clearly not your husband’s
intention.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: My god.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: He intended Heather to benefit –</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Of course, of course, I understand. Of
course.</p>
<p><strong>hardin</strong>: As you can imagine, Mrs. Walkers given the
circumstances of Edmund’s death, none of this is going to happen… how
should I say it… simply.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: … Of course…</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You look good in black.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ve missed you so badly. I need you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: At first I couldn’t figure out when you got
ahold of my stationery and stuff. It finally came to me… Edmund’s
signature must have been a snap. And you knew I wasn’t gonna challenge
mine –</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Please stop. I don’t blame you for hating me
right now.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’ve really done it, Matty. You really
have.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Will you come to the house tonight?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I want you more right now than I ever have. I
know how you must feel about me. But please come tonight.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I hope you haven’t done us in.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hi, guys. Just come on in, make yourself at
home.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Not me. The door was unlocked, inviting
illegal entry. It’s behavior like that makes Oscar’s job so hard.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Sorry, Oscar. Would you guys a beer?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: No thanks, I already had one.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ve gotta bring my wife up here. She thinks
our house is the hottest place in the county.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It ain’t great this time of day.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Ned, how did you get involved with this Matty
Walker?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I mean she’s poison, man. Tell me what you
know about her old man’s death.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What read in the paper. He died in the fire.
Looks like arson–</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Was arson.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Okay, was arson. You don’t know if he was
setting it and messed up… or if that’s just what someone wanted it to
look like.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Nah, he didn’t set it. Somebody offend
him.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: His people owned the place or something?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s right. A very rough group of fellows,
too. They’re arguing with the insurance company right now. It’s possible
they wanted to cut old Edmund out. I’m sure they’re not too broken up
over his departure. But this just doesn’t seem like a neat way to handle
something like that.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: It’s not their style. They’re very
smooth. They’d rather destroy you than kill you. And they hate
publicity.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Course guys like that make a lot of enemies.
Coulda been a grudge match from the outside, I suppose. But me, I’m
kinda interested in the grieving widow.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Her sister-in-law’s got plenty of ideas
along that line, too. She could barely contain herself today, I could
tell. But she wants to wait and see how Matty treats her on the estate.
She doesn’t want to blow it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How’d you get involved?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: They asked me to re-do the will. I met with
her and Edmund. It was pretty simple. This Mary Ann Simpson witnessed it
with me. Walker didn’t seem to think it was any big deal.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What was this Simpson’s story?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t know… old friend of theirs,
good-looking broad. She was just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: On her way to Europe?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The passport people can’t find any record of
that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What do you think? About the wife?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I suppose it’s possible. I don’t know much
about her, except – – what I’ve seen. Wouldn’t shock me, either way.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I’ve got a feeling she’s very bad news.
Take some incredibly intelligent advice and stay away from her.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He’s right for once.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Well, I’m sorry, guys. I’m afraid I can’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: First of all, did you get a look at her?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That wouldn’t be quite so meaningful, except
that today she started coming on to me. And maybe you haven’t heard but
the lady is about to come into a great deal of money.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The fact is, she’s invited me out to her
place tonight. And I’m going. And I’ll keep on going as many nights, or
days, or weekends, as she’ll have me.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Ned, that lady may have just killed her
husband.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Peter, she’s not gonna inherit anything by
killing me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Ned, you’ve messed up before. You’ll mess up
again. That’s your nature. But they’ve always been small-time. This
might not be. She’s trouble, Ned. The real thing. Big-time, major league
trouble. Watch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I know. I know. I know you’d probably like to
kill me. I know. But please… you can hate me… punish me… hurt me if you
want, but don’t talk yet.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Please, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: … Mary Ann and I left Wheaton together and
went to Chicago. We didn’t know what we were doing. I got in bad trouble
with drugs. Speed. Really bad. I did things… Whatever’s the evilest
thing you can think of me now, I did worse things then. There’s nothing
lower than the animal I was then. Worse than you can imagine. I thought
I would die. I prayed I would… And then a man helped me. He got me
clean. He didn’t want much in return, either… He was a lawyer and he put
me to work in his office. I learned a lot there. One time I even thought
I might go to law school. … That’s where I picked up the business about
making a will invalid. That happened to him once. I swear I would never
have used that if I’d known about your case… I was afraid to tell you,
Ned. I knew you wouldn’t let me do it. I’m greedy, like you said. I
wanted us to have it all.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I don’t blame you for thinking I’m bad. I am.
I know it. I’d understand if you just cut me off now. If you never
trusted me again. You’d probably be smart. But you must believe one
thing. I love you. I love you and need you. I want to be with you
forever.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: They already think you’re involved.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: There’s nothing we can do about it now. In a
little while we’ll either have the money or we won’t. It’s out of our
hands.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I fired the housekeeper. We can stay together
as long as we want. We’re all alone here now.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ve been down there a lot lately. Isn’t
that amazing? Miami. Jesus. I’m handling the purchase of some property
down there. I’ll be going back in the future… if that’s all right, if
it’s still legal to go to Miami.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: He is mad.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Nooo. No, I’m not mad. Why should I be mad
just because my friend here, who I’ve know for years, wants to know of
my whereabouts on the night of our recent local murder?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: It’s not so recent anymore. Maybe he’s
feeling some pressure.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You brought this on yourself, man! I don’t
run this department, you know. There are people watching this thing.
They hear you’re out there banging the widow every night; it tends to
call attention to you. So don’t give me shit.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s my business!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This whole damn case is getting crazy.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Did you tell him about the glasses?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Seems Walker always ware glasses –
steel-rimmed glasses. He was a real fanatic about them.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: But there were none on the scene.
Coroner says they should’ve been there. He says that even after the fire
the frames should’ve been seared into his – well, you don’t want to hear
the details.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So it’s looking more and more like he was
killed somewhere else and brought there in his own car. Your honey, his
wife, says he left the house in the middle of the night driving himself
to some mysterious meeting. Is that vague enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Look, what is this? What do you want? Am I
supposed to be an undercover agent for you guys, or something?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Interesting choice of phrase.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How ‘bout tonight I ask her? ’Say, did you
kill your husband? My friends were just wondering…’</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Hey, that’s an idea. Ask her where the
glasses are, where she did it… Anything else I’m forgetting, Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Just one thing.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Oh, yeah! Right, right. You’ll love
this, Ned, this latest development. Maybe you’ll be able to work up a
little sympathy for us, see why Oscar here has a tendency to get carried
away. Tell him, Oscar. This is rich.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: This is from the sister-in-law, the Kraft
woman. She’s been driving me batty lately. She’s convinced she ain’t
gonna be out into the will. It seems that a couple weeks before the
murder, Walker’s niece stayed up there for a while with your friend
Matty. One night she waxes up, goes to see her aunt and catches the lady
with some guy.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Do you get it? In the act or some
fucking thing!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We haven’t got all the details yet.
Mrs. Kraft is bringing the little girl up here today to tell us her
story.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Oh, they’re here. I ran into them on the
way in. They’re waiting outside.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Christ. I’m not sure I’m up to dealing with
this scene.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Listen, you probably don’t want to see the
Kraft woman right now. She’s a little wild. Why don’t you slip out the
back way here?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Are we done here?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ve got it all here. And, Ned, I’m sorry I
had to ask.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ll go out this way. I’ve had a lot of
experience with disgruntled people. I’ll be over to Stella’s, if you
want to have some lunch.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Kraft.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Hello, Mr. Racine.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: How are you making out?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: We’re all right, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You must be Heather.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m Ned Racine, Heather. I’ve heard a lot
about you. It’s nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m sorry our town is so hot for your
visit.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It sure is.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Hi, Racine. How you doing today?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m fine, Stella. I’m fine. What’s the
latest? Any hot news?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Nothing much doing. What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What’s the special?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Veal outlets.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What day’d you cook ’em?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: They’re fresh this month.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: The usual, my sweet.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Two ice teas for Fred Astaire.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Are you ready to hear something
wild?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t know. I may have had my share for
the day.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: No, this is right up your alley.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Little Heather comes out onto the back
porch, and this dude is out there with her aunt, see? And he’s turned
away with his pants or shorts or whatever dropped, so he’s mooning the
little girl, right. And he and your friend are going at something which
Heather couldn’t quite figure out.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Poor little Heather! She’s never seen
one angry before. But it made quite an impression on her. Yessirree!
That’s all she can remember.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: One other thing. She says the guy’s hair
was greasy. He wore it slicked back. “Like a Cuban,” she says. I loved
that! Can you imagine poor Heather? She hustled back to bed after
getting a gander at that. And listen to why she got up in the first
place, this is the capper. She had a nightmare! Christ, can you imagine
what kinds of dreams she had the rest of the night?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Don’t say that. Don’t say you don’t have
them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I swear to you, I don’t. What’s wrong with
you?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: They had to be here when you cleaned up that
night. Think about it, think hard. They’ve probably got my prints on
them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I must have missed them. I wasn’t looking for
them. I thought they were on Edmund.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: So where could they have gone?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I don’t know. Betty!</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The housekeeper? Where would she have put
them? You’ve been through his things.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: She might have taken them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Listen to me. That’s why I fired her. After
Edmund’s death she started acting strange. She was always watching me,
listening to my calls.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: That’s crazy. You imagined it. I know, I’ve
been imagining things, too. Plenty.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No, Ned, not with her I wasn’t. I could tell
there was a difference. Maybe she know about us. Maybe she wants
something.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Don’t you think we would have heard from her
by now?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I don’t know what to think. I’m worried. But
it’s not about the glasses. Or your friends. It’s us.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Your first reaction is to accuse me. What’s
happening to you? I don’t know if we can hold on like this.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Hardin called today. He said everything
should be cleared up by next week. I’ll get the money He apologized for
the delay.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: They’ve been stalling. They’re draggin it
out, hoping they’d come up with some way to implicate you.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: But they haven’t been able to. Soon it’ll be
all ours. That’s why we’ve got to hold together, Ned. It won’t be long,
then we’ll get away from here. Out from under all this. All we have is
each other. I’d kill myself if I thought this thing would destroy us. I
couldn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Peter?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Hi, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I’ve been looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Yeah. You always run this late?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Nah. I’m going to Miami tomorrow. I’m not
gonna have time.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: What’s in Miami?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’m closing this real estate deal I’ve been
working on.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: You’re some kind of health nut. Matty
Walker smokes that same brand. I noticed that.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Is this gonna be one of those conversations?
Maybe I should have my lawyer present.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Buddy, your lawyer is present.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: You know, that Edmund Walker was a bad
guy. The more I find out about him, the happier I am he’s dead. I figure
it’s a positive thing for the world.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’re not known for being a hardliner.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Mmm. I have my own standards. I try to
keep them private. As far as I’m concerned, I don’t care who killed him.
And I don’t care who gets rich because of it. But Oscar, Oscar’s not
like that. His whole life is based on doing the right thing. He’s the
only person I know like that. Sometimes it’s a real pain in the ass.
Even for him.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Oscar’s unhappy right now. He’s in
pain.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Because he likes you. He likes you even
better than I do. That’s why he’s been busting his butt trying to locate
this Mary Ann Simpson. They finally found her place in Miami yesterday,
but the woman herself was gone… looked like she left in a hurry. Oscar
thought any story she could tell might help you. He thinks you need
help.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Someone’s putting you in deep trouble,
my friend. From about three thirty to five AM on the night Walker was
killed, someone called your hotel room repeatedly. The hotel didn’t want
to put them through, but whoever was calling convinced them it was an
emergency. The phone rang and rang, but you didn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Don’t say anything. Save it for some
Other time. It gets worse. Now someone’s trying to give us Edmund’s
glasses. We don’t know who. We don’t know what the glasses will tell us.
But our negotiations are continuing.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I wish I knew what to tell you, Ned. But
I don’t have any good ideas.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I’ll see ya.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: We know each other, don’t we? I’m Michael
Glenn. With Bashford, Hillerman.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Ned Racine.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Christ, I’ve done it again. I’m just meeting
some people.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Hey, this is silly. You’re not still mad
about that Gourson business? We had to do it. Costanza practically
insisted we sue you. Listen, nobody at our place likes malpractice
against other lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I tried to make it up to you.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Did you ever meet a lady named Matty Walker?
You’d remember her. A very hot number.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Matty Walker?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Yeah. I met her at a party. She said she was
going up there and she wanted to know about lawyers. I gave her your
name.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: When was this?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I don’t know… long time. Maybe September.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Oops, gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Did you tell her about the Gourson case?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Hey, I was trying to get you work.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Did you tell her about Gourson?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Jesus, are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Maybe I told her how we met. Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Is there something wrong with your
phone?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Just off the hook. What?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Teddy Laursen is in County. He’s very
anxious to talk to you. He sounded bad.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Hey, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I don’t know. It’s a thing in Lauderdale.
Something must’ve gone wrong, but they’re not telling me. I’m a little
worried.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: No, no. That’s not why I called you. In fact,
I got me another lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I think it would be better. You know
Schlisgal.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: He’s good.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: This broad came to me last week. A real
looker. She said you told her how to reach me, I figured you musta, she
knew all about it. She said you wanted another one.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Yeah, I was afraid of that. But I’m a slow
thinker.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: She had me show her how to rig it to a door,
with a little delay. Does any of this mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Then I’m glad I told you. Watch your
step.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Thanks, Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Racine… Don’t thank me yet. These guys here,
they’ve been asking me about The Breakers. I haven’t told ’em shit. But
I don’t like the look on their faces.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Ned. It’s Mrs. Walker. Do you want her?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yeah. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Hello, Ned. Can we talk?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Okay. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’m in Miami. I’ve been running around like
crazy and I could reach you before I left.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ve got the money. I’ve taken it and sent it
somewhere safe. It’s all ours now. But that’s not the best part.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: What’s the best part?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: The glasses. I got them back. That is, they
should be ours by now. Betty had them. She wanted money. That’s why I
had to come down here. She made it all very difficult, but I think it
worked out.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Do you have them?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No. She wouldn’t do that. She’s putting them
in the boathouse. In the top drawer of the dresser in the boathouse.
They should be there now, if she’s kept up her end.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I think you’d better get them right away. I
don’t trust her.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: In the boathouse.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: That’s right. The top drawer of the dresser.
Oh. Ned, we’re going to be all right. I’ll leave here as soon</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: as I can. I should be there by seven- thirty.
I can’t wait to see you, darling. We’ve made it.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Good-bye, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Teddy, this is Detective Knapp from the Fort
Lauderdale Arson Squad. He’s brought some very bad news about that fire.
Seems there were two people who didn’t get out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know, Teddy. It’s not like you. And I’m
willing to make that clear to anybody who’ll listen. But you’re going to
have to help me out on this Breakers business.</p>
<p><strong>pinehaven</strong>: Please drive safely”</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: Stupid. That’s always been the problem.
Her mind encompasses his.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I better go get him.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Hello, darling.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Hello, Matty.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Where’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: In the back. With yours.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Why haven’t you turned on the lights?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I could see.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: It’s all ours now, Ned. We could leave
tonight if we wanted. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What’s this –?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It’s Edmund’s gun. You remember it, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: What is it, Ned? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I think you know.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: No. I swear to you, I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: It’s the glasses, Matty.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Weren’t they there? Didn’t she bring
them?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I didn’t see them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: She promised she’d bring them.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Maybe I missed them. The way you missed them
that night.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Ned, I don’t know what you think, but you’re
wrong. I haven’t done anything to hurt you. I love you. You’ve got to
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Keep talking, Matty. Experience shows I can
be convinced of anything.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I did arrange to meet you. But, Ned, it all
changed. You changed it. I fell in love with you. I didn’t plan
that…</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You never quit, do you? You just keep on
coming.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: How can I prove it to you? What can I
say?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: The glasses, Matty. Why don’t you go down
there and get them?</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: But you said they weren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I said I didn’t see them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: I’ll go, Ned. I’ll go and look for them.</p>
<p><strong>matty</strong>: Ned… no matter what you think, I do love
you.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: No, Matty! Stop! Don’t go in! Matty.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: She’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: But what if that was someone else’s body in
there? What if it was already there when I got there – dead and waiting
for me. Maybe her friend… Mary Ann.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Her teeth were left, man. We sent them back
to Illinois. The identification was positive. That was her, that was
Matty Tyler Walker. That was her and she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You’re not listening to me. What if she’s
been using this other girl’s name? Since she met Walker three years ago,
since she first spotted him and decided to take him… one way or another.
Maybe Walker – or any of us – never knew her real name.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why would she want to hide her identity?</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe there was something in
her past, something so bad she was afraid it would queer it with Walker
if he found out – that he’d never marry her.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Let’s say she’s living as the other girl,
this girl from her past. Someone whose history she knew and could use
any way she wanted. And there’s only one person in the world who knows
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: And then just when Matty’s got me on the
line, when she’s finally going to collect, that one person shows up.
That girl. Finds her. And threatens to expose her. So Matty starts
paying her off. Maybe she even promises to cut her in on Edmunds’ money.
Now she’s got to share it with two people.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: But when Matty sees a way to get rid of both
of them at once. A way to solve all her problems and get clear, with no
one looking for her. At the boathouse. You find two bodies, me and this
girl. Two killers dead. Case closed.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: You can’t find the money, can you, Oscar?
Doesn’t that tell you something?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It tells me she moved it and we can’t find
it. And that don’t mean shit. It could be sittin’ in any bank in the
world waiting for a dead lady to come for it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do you hear what you’re saying? It’s crazy.
This Matty would’ve had to been one quick, smart broad.</p>
<p><strong>racine</strong>: Oscar, don’t you understand? That was her
special gift she was relentless. Matty was the kind of person who could
do what was necessary. Whatever was necessary.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Racine, you got to face something. You killed
Edmund Walker, man. And you’re going down for it. Two people are dead.
And no matter how you want to figure it, you ain’t bringin’ either of
’em back to life.</p>
