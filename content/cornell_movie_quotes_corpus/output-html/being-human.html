<p><strong>being human</strong>: Hector is a family man. He and his
woman and two children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a
hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance by a covering
of branches and brush. Just inside a small fire smoulders permanently, a
few times a day encouraged into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever
went out it would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com-
fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family. Hector doesn’t
know that his name is Hector. It is simply a convenience to help us tell
his story. The idea of individual names is an imaginative leap that has
not yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector is living
out his life 4000 years before the birth of Christ, in a reasonably
temperate zone of the planet. In his entire life Hector will traverse no
more than ten square miles of it.</p>
<p><strong>first image</strong>: is the reflection of Hector’s face in a
rock pool. The image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself,
deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his image reforms
itself and then is disrupted again. When he is finished, a trace of
vanity makes him bend down closer to his reflection. He strokes his long
hair and fingers a blemish on his cheek. Then he is aware of another
presence. He sharply turns. Some way off a solitary figure stands on the
rise of some rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Go back home… leave me alone…</p>
<p><strong>1-4 continued: 1-4</strong>: The Boy tumbles down from the
shelf to the cave floor at his mother, DEIRDRE’s feet, howling in pain.
Deidre scowls at Hector. If the gesture had been invented he would
probably shrug his shoulders. The Boy howls on. Hector kneels beside his
daughter, absorbed in her antics as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer.
Her whole little form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy
unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime noises, squeals
and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci- nated. Where has his daughter
gone? Who is this strange wild creature that has taken her form, lying
beside him? Hector’s daughter delights him. And while Hector watches his
daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No… stay here… stay!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No… go back… go away…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Leave me alone! Stay here… Stay!</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. shore - day 5</strong>: Hector is foraging on the
shoreline, gathering cockles, seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible.
He splashes in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven bag.
Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its shell or crunch on a
particularly tasty piece of seaweed. Hector looks about 30 years old.
This is advanced middle age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy
cold and an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition a
modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly drugged days in
bed, perhaps attempting a little light paperwork propped up on some
pillows.</p>
<p><strong>6 continued: 6</strong>: He stops for breath and to look back
on the bay. The shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly
made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal raiding. The
boats are nearing the beach now and figures can be seen preparing to
land. Hector gathers enough of his wits and strength to continue his
race up the hillside.</p>
<p><strong>8 ext. hillside - day 8</strong>: Hector shoves his children
in one direction up the slope further into the hills. His woman runs off
the other way. A hasty, confused argument takes place.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Up the hill!</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: No, down onto the other beach. The little
ones can’t take the hill. Neither can I.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Up the hill! They’re down there already. I
saw them!</p>
<p><strong>deirdre</strong>: You’re wrong!</p>
<p><strong>8 continued: 8</strong>: The little Girl starts to go back
for a precious toy she has dropped. Hector picks her up and carries her
off over his shoulder. The Boy follows. Deirdre is trailing behind them.
She was right. She doesn’t have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks
back and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con- fusion of
fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to go back and help her, but
then changes his mind and runs off once again with the children. Deirdre
is by now throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers, hoping
that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her to gain some ground.
But they don’t stop and the effort tires her even more.</p>
<p><strong>9 ext. valley - day 9</strong>: Hector is tiring, too. With
the Girl still awkwardly clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a
steep slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops for a breath
and sees the raiders moving into the valley below. In a moment of utter
panic he lets go of his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs
on alone. We can sense the moment of release in his unburdened flight.
But it doesn’t last long. Some way up the slope he stops and turns. He
sees his children, only now beginning to work out what has happened, and
the raiders below. He can’t do it. Even as the Girl calls to him he is
running back down the hill, feeling the first stab of a guilt that will
never leave him.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Come back, Dada…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Don’t move from here. I’ll come for you in
the morning. There’s no food. Try and sleep in the branches. Don’t cry.
Don’t make a noise.</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. rocks - dusk 11</strong>: It is dusk now. We find
Hector waking from a fitful sleep behind some rocks. He sits up and
takes in his surroundings. His face hardens as awareness of his pre-
dicament returns. He stands up and then crouching low, moves off down
the hill.</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. valley - dusk 12</strong>: Hector has returned to the
area of the tree. He slows down some distance away and just in time. He
sees a figure standing beneath the tree. He moves forward to the
protection of some rocks, and watches. He is close enough to hear the
voice of the solitary Raider, although he doesn’t understand the words.
The Raider looks up into the branches and talks in a friendly,
persuasive way.</p>
<p><strong>raider</strong>: It’s too cold to spend all night up there.
We’ve got a fire at the beach. Food, too.</p>
<p><strong>raider</strong>: Come on! Your mother’s down there. She’s
happy… she’s warm, too… and full… she wants to see you… she sent me…</p>
<p><strong>12 continued: 12</strong>: Then he reaches up for the Girl,
catches her as she drops and keeps her in his arms. He laughs in a
comforting way.</p>
<p><strong>raider</strong>: That was easy, eh? You’re half asleep
already, little girl. I’ll carry you.</p>
<p><strong>14 ext. rock shelter - night 14</strong>: Hector spends a
long, cold night alone, squatting in a narrow crevice in the rocks. He
doesn’t sleep, or even attempt to close his eyes. He stares into the
darkness. There is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi- losophy
or religion, no friend to run to. This night he is utterly alone.</p>
<p><strong>15 ext. rocks - morning 15</strong>: In the morning it is
lightly raining. Hector stands in the drizzle outside the shelter. It
seems to revive him, refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however
meager, that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc- tion of
the shore. There is not much else that he can do.</p>
<p><strong>16 ext. beach - day 16</strong>: The Raiders are loading up
their boats, wading back and forth from the shoreline. Hector watches
from cover. His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting
whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.</p>
<p><strong>17 ext. cliffs - day 17</strong>: Hector’s hands have been
bound with rope. He is being led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest
and the Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely. At the top of the
cliff the bay and the boats and the wide sea are stretched out beneath
them. The Priest, as they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile
of large stones at the very summit of the headland. The mound of stones
is obviously man-made.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I told you! I knew they did it around here!
Ask him…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: What do we do? Do we throw you over, is that
the idea?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: He wants me to throw you over. What does it
do? Does it help the sun? Should I throw you over?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I tell you, it’s one man, one stone. It’ll
help the voyage.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: What’s it got to do with the sun?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I don’t know, yet.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: No. It’s too much of a risk. Just add a
stone to the pile. Let him go. That’s the best we can do. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: It’s meaningless, without him going over the
cliff.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Off you go. We don’t want you.</p>
<p><strong>18 continued: 18</strong>: Then the tense moment passes, as
the man grunts and nods at Hector’s hands, still bound with rope. Hector
under- stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort hacks
through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades back to the boat.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. cave - day 19</strong>: Hector has returned to his
cave home, now cold and empty of life. He is working on his instincts
now, still emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of the
fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold some life. Hector bends
low and starts to waft expertly and blow at the fire’s remains. We leave
our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the simplest act of physical
survival. For him the problems of emotional survival without his family
lie ahead.</p>
<p><strong>21 int. bathhouse - day 21</strong>: Above the heat and filth
there is a different world. A clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing
figures, droning conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room
of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have advanced 4000
years into the future and it shows in the technology. It is men’s day at
the bathhouse. All of the people relaxing in the water look prosperous
and comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance, some around
the edge of the pool, others in the water rubbing backs and massaging
shoulders. There are three or four times as many slaves as bathers, and
the proprie- torial way that they look after their masters gives the
place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over- indulged
grown-ups.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: I’m going to the cool room.</p>
<p><strong>22 int. bathhouse - another angle - day 22</strong>: Hector
wraps the towel around his master and follows him, a look of concern on
his face. Lucinnius’ worries are Hector’s also. Hector walks a pace
behind Lucinnius through various chambers of the bathhouse, passing the
games area and the massage room as they go. All around them slaves
attend to their pampered masters.</p>
<p><strong>23 continued: 23</strong>: Hector as if by magic produces a
small wooden stool for his master to sit on as he joins the others.
Hector then moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master’s
behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his
friends. The eldest of the three gives off as much of the aura of a
Godfather as a naked man in a towel can. The other two are deferential
to the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con- tempt. Hector
watches the older man put a paternal hand on Luccinius’s shoulder and
speak with a calm smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his
master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave and master exist so
closely together that many of their feelings are shared. More precisely,
Lucinnius’s feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.
From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too, Hector is
living two lives, his own and his master’s. Here in ancient Rome is this
what they call classic schizophrenia? As Luccinius stands to leave we
can tell by their expres- sions that the THREE MEN are open in their
contempt for him. Hector is quickly on his feet and by Lucinnius’s side
as he goes. A final sarcastic remark comes from one of the three.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Well washed, Lucinnius.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Bad omens, Hector. Bad omens. Get me
something to eat. Just a mouse or two.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Two mice… and some bread…</p>
<p><strong>stallholder</strong>: No mice.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Two chicken legs, then, cold, and the
bread.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Of course you’re free to call at my house at
anytime, but I was receiving Nepos… how could I admit you?</p>
<p><strong>slave #1</strong>: Spoiled his day, meeting your man… he’s
been avoiding him all week.</p>
<p><strong>slave #2</strong>: His ships have gone too, we heard.</p>
<p><strong>24 continued: 24</strong>: This is news to Hector.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: When did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>slave #2</strong>: Last night. Nepos knew. Pirates. They’re
sunk, he reckons. That could finish him, eh?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: This is the worst it’s been.</p>
<p><strong>slave #1</strong>: You’ll be up for sale before you know
it!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: He’s finished… you reckon?</p>
<p><strong>slave #1</strong>: Yes… at the baths… I could tell… they
smelled blood…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well… if he’d pulled it off he’d be in Rome
by now…</p>
<p><strong>slave #1</strong>: And you with him…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: And me with him… half way home…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: He’s a true friend, probably the only one
I have left.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Will he lend you the money?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: He was honest about it. He said so, plain
and simple. No.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: That’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: And the ships have gone… did I tell you
that?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Have they?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Cyprian knows already. He’ll want his
money back too…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: When we get home I want you to get some
chickens… and fetch Hermas, the diviner.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>26 int. house - day 26</strong>: At home, we find Lucinnius
and Hector with the diviner HERMAS. They are gathered around a shrine in
the large public room. The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of
marble. Hermas prods them with a knife. He makes much of the mysteries
of his craft, as if it were a skill beyond ordinary men.</p>
<p><strong>26 continued: 26</strong>: The other two peer over his
shoulders. Suitably mysti- fied, Lucinnius talks in a reverent low
voice.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Are my ships from Sicily still
afloat…?</p>
<p><strong>hermas</strong>: No, no… offer the grain first… sprinkle it
on the altar…</p>
<p><strong>hermas</strong>: … and we can’t ask the Gods specific
questions like that… it’s a gentle, probing enquiry… general questions…
but let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>hermas</strong>: General answer… no…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>hermas</strong>: I mean, no. The liver says no…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Do it again… I want you to do it again…
Is it the Gods’ will… that Cyprian… be well disposed towards me… in the
future?</p>
<p><strong>hermas</strong>: If you want to do it again, you need another
chicken and another fifteen sesterces… and I’d like the first fifteen
now please.</p>
<p><strong>27 int. house - night 27</strong>: Hector is giving Lucinnius
a soothing shoulder massage.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Cyprian loaned me half a million to fit
out these ships… I’m finished. Just when things were going well… I had
plans for you too, Hector… in four or five years I was going to make you
a free man… and then in ten years you’d be a citizen… you… you could’ve
found your family… brought them here… everything…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: It does, doesn’t it!</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: I shouldn’t give up. I can’t… I’ll visit
Cyprian, first thing tomorrow… before the others can get to him… he’s
got to see reason… I can pay him back… sometime. It’s the only chance we
have, Hector. Should I do it?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You must.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: You’re right. I must.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Thalia, I think I need one of your
massages. Hector, you can finish the lamps.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Lower, Thalia.</p>
<p><strong>29 int. house - night 29</strong>: In the darkened house,
Hector makes his way up some stairs and along a passage. The only sound
is a crack or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage, Hector
finds a small ladder propped against the wall. He climbs this, and lifts
open the trap door above his head.</p>
<p><strong>30 ext. roof - night 30</strong>: Odd flashes of lightning
far out to sea are the only source of light as Hector moves across the
flat roof. In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline of
a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He moves towards it. The
figure speaks.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: I missed you last night.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: He kept me working until morning.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: He has no money and a lot of enemies. If
he’s very clever he’ll survive… but the omens are bad… and he’s not very
clever.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: She doesn’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Nobody does. He’s unfortunate. You get
people like that. Clumsy and sad.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: Why does the thunder always stay out on the
ocean?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s the Gods arguing. They’re working out
what to do with Lucinnius… he’ll be lying awake down there… wondering
what they’re saying about him.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: If he goes down I’ll ask for my freedom… he
owes it to me… he said as much… you too… we could be free…</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What we talk about.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: We talk about going home. Yours is that way
and mine is that way… your family is that way.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I just made that up… I don’t know which way
they are… anyway … you can’t think like that. Not after so many
years…</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: It’s what you talk about.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We talk about it because it can never
happen. What we do is you and me…</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: I don’t understand. I think you’ll leave.
You’re going to leave me here.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Never. It’s you and me now. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: Well. We stay here. He’ll survive.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Then I can see you every night. I’m
tired.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: I can’t sleep. Get me a chicken. I want
to make another sacrifice. We’ll do it ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>32 int. henhouse - night 32</strong>: Hector is in the
henhouse, in the dark, selecting a chicken for sacrifice. He is about to
leave when he sees a MAN and WOMAN, arms around each other, sitting in a
corner. The Man looks at the white hen Hector is holding.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can’t you find a woman, Hector…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Sorry to trouble you… just fetching a
chicken… good night … the roof’s free…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Come on, miss, you can tell Lucinnius his
future.</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. street - morning 33</strong>: Hector and Lucinnius
are approaching the home of Cyprian. Hector as usual is walking some
paces behind his master, and he carries a large satchel of documents.
Cyprian’s home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but there
is already activity around the house, visitors coming and going,
messengers, petitioners. A few impor- tant callers arrive in litters,
carried by slaves. Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the
door and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius’s hopes of quietly
bending Cyprian’s ear are dashed. It seems as if the whole world owes
allegiance to this provincial Mr. Big.</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. courtyard - morning 34</strong>: The slaves gather on
one side of the courtyard, gossiping and playing games of chance on the
ground. Their masters wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on
benches along the wall. Cyprian’s aides usher the visitors into his
presence in a regular flow, some have an audience of a few minutes,
others last merely seconds.</p>
<p><strong>34 continued: 34</strong>: Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in
line, does look a little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed,
hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial
offering himself. Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other
slaves as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by place to
the front of the line. We almost expect Hector to give him a little wave
of encouragement as he is finally summoned into the inner office. Hector
waits. The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn’t emerge within the
first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him the time of day. More
minutes pass. Hector watches a game of handball while keeping an eye on
the office door. One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse,
go into the office. So does Lucinnius’ friend Julian.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You look happier.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Relieved anyway… relieved that it’s over
at last.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Will he help you?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: I have to kill myself by tomorrow
morning. He has all my letters to Titinius, none of them got through. He
says it’s like treason… and he says I should want to die for owing him
half a million anyway…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What if you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Then he will… and that wouldn’t be
pleasant… he would drag me to Rome… those letters…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: I’m done for, Hector… but it’s strange… I
feel kind of good about it… the struggle is over … we’ve seen it through
together, eh?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Let’s get home. We have a lot to do.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Tonight… peace at last…</p>
<p><strong>36 int. house - day 36</strong>: Hector and Lucinnius are in
his study. Lucinnius is busy clearing up his papers. He is less
hysterical than in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what
he has to do.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: We’ll do it with a knife, Hector. When
everyone has gone to bed. The two of us, to the end…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t understand. What do you want me to
do… I don’t think I can help you…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: We’ll help each other, Hector. We must.
We’ve been through this whole mess together… we must die together.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t know what you mean. What mess?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: You don’t understand do you? I’m asking
you to die with me… you’re my closest, my dearest slave… what would they
say about me if you refused to die with me? This is honor… we’re
choosing death… we’re not going to submit to the humiliations that
Cyprian can heap on us, are we?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You say we… I don’t know… what is we? I’ve
done nothing… I know nothing…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Hector… at Cyprian’s this morning … I had
to sign certain papers … tell a bit of a story…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What kind of story?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: A confession. That we were plotting
against Cyprian and the provincial senate… we were short of names… most
of the people I know were in the room… people I thought were my friends…
so I mentioned you… I had to…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: So I’m a conspirator?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Yes. So you see, I don’t want you to die
with me just because of my honor… it’s more complicated… I’m sorry,
Hector. I would be honored… if you would die with me… I mean it…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Can I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: This is the worst it’s been.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: But even if it’s round you can still fall
off the edge.</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: No… it’s not round like that… it’s round
like this.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Do you believe everything that Greek tells
you…?</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: Rome must be right in the middle… here… and
we must be out here somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: So, where is my home?</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: How many months did they march you here?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: It must be about here.</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: But then you’d be upside down…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I wasn’t upside down… and how could you see
the sun round there … I saw the sun at home… every day…</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: I’ll ask him tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes, tell me tomorrow… I’d like to know…
because my children are round there and I want to know that they’re
getting the sun… ask him something else, too… where are the gods if the
whole thing is round?</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: I think I know that… they’re out here, and
all around… that’s how they can look down and see everything…</p>
<p><strong>38 int. altar - night 38</strong>: Lucinnius is at it again.
In the lamplight, a live chicken stands on the altar.</p>
<p><strong>38 continued: 38</strong>: Hector and Lucinnius watch it as
if their lives depended on it. Perhaps they do.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: If he eats the grain it means yes.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s saying yes… there’s a way…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: No, it’s saying yes, we should die.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: But you asked it if we had to die, or if
there was another way… it’s saying yes, there is…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: No, it’s saying yes, we should die.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Maybe it’s just hungry…</p>
<p><strong>39 int. dining room - night 39</strong>: A dead chicken
adorns Lucinnius’s table. He and his wife, DALMIA, and their son are
lying on their couches picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius
is drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other household slaves
are in attendance. Thalia is also there, serving her mistress. Dalmia
knows something is up, but she doesn’t know what. She attempts to break
the silence. She calls on the cook from the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>dalmia</strong>: Solus!</p>
<p><strong>dalmia</strong>: Solus… I’m eating chicken again. I ate
chicken yesterday and the day before… will I be eating chicken again
tomorrow? Why am I always eating chicken?</p>
<p><strong>39 continued: 39</strong>: SOLUS looks up at Lucinnius and
Hector, but they offer him no help.</p>
<p><strong>solus</strong>: It’s what we have to hand in the kitchen,
ma’am… I always try to use the fresh stuff… the chickens have just been
turning up…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: Two men have come to see you. From
Cyprian.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. reception room - night 40</strong>: The two VISITORS
that await Lucinnius and Hector are an unpromising sight. They are big
men, unsophisticated and look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A
couple of the godfather’s foot soldiers. They greet Lucinnius
deferentially, but he knows that they would break his back at the whim
of their master.</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian asked us
if we could be of any assistance… in the business that you have to
conduct tonight… to make that business as… comfortable… as you could
wish…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Thank you, gentlemen… But I feel that I
will be capable of taking care of my affairs tonight without your help…
Thank Cyprian for his kind thought…</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: We’re spending the night at the house of
Nepos, not far from here. Don’t hesitate to send your man for us… at any
time… We’re anxious that things should go well for you.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Thank you. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: We’ll call in the morning at any rate… just
to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: You. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: He looks like the kind that’ll want some
help. Have you ever killed before?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Only chickens.</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: He’s not much different. Use a thin blade,
but long. Get it in deep… the heart… feel for a space between the
ribs…</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: … or go in from the back… any place he’ll
let you…</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: Getting it out’s not as easy as you might
think… you have to twist a bit… to get over the stickiness…</p>
<p><strong>41 int. study - night 41</strong>: Late at night in
Lucinnius’s study, an oil lamp and a candle cast their shadowy light,
adding to the tension in the room. Hector stands beside Lucinnius, who
is counting out coins and other valuables on his table.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Eight hundred sesterces… cash … that’s
all that’s left… what a failure… my father left me three farms and forty
thousand…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Nothing else to be done. Don’t you want
some wine?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No… but I want something…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I want to die a free man… I don’t want to
die a slave…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Hector, by this proclamation, I make you
a freed man… I don’t know the exact words… I’ve never done it before…
But you’re free, Hector.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: In writing… so that when they find me… they
know I died a free man… please…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Very well…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: They’ll find it in the morning. It’s a
nice thought, Hector… you were right to ask.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Well… freed man, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Nothing… I mean, not to me… I have to do
it first… you understand that… and then you… if I don’t succeed… then
you must help me…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: No point in messing up the room. Let’s go
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. passage - night 42</strong>: The house is quiet and
in darkness as they walk along the passage and down the stairs to the
washing room. Hector walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius’s
crumpled, defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first quietly, then
more loudly and more pathetically. Hector looks around and behind him,
afraid, or perhaps hoping, that Lucinnius’s moans will wake the
household.</p>
<p><strong>43 continued: 43</strong>: He runs into the tiled washing
room, wails loudly and makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector
sees all of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius crumples
to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls out in pain.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Oh, that hurts, that stings!</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: This is hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Help me, Hector…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’ve done it… you’ve done it … lie
down…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Close your eyes… you did it…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: You do it now, Hector… hurry…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Lie still… lie still…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Do it Hector… do it… you promised…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Shush… I’ll need the knife…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Take it… do it…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Do it, Hector… do it… do it…</p>
<p><strong>lucinnius</strong>: Do it… do it… do it…</p>
<p><strong>44 int. study - night 44</strong>: Hector runs into the study
and makes for the box contain- ing the coins. He puts most of them into
a leather money bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on
Lucinnius’s cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns quickly to pick
up his certificate of freedom from the table. Then just as he is
leaving, he again stops, sits down on the chair, pulls off his worn
shoes and places on his feet a pair of Lucinnius’s stout street
sandals.</p>
<p><strong>46 continued: 46</strong>: Hector whispers to her before she
has time to open her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m leaving… come now if you want to… but we
must hurry… I’m a free man… I’m free. Will you come?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I have some mail for Tyre… where are the
east-bound ships?</p>
<p><strong>watchman</strong>: Ask at the harbor.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We want a timber ship… they go west…
straight to Rome…</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: And then? Then you go home?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You can go to anywhere from Rome.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. quay - night 48</strong>: Hector and Thalia approach
a ship heavily laden with timber. Final supplies are being carried
aboard, super- vised by two men on the quay. Hector approaches them.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Where is the Captain?</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: He’s on the ship.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Good morning, Captain… I’m looking for
passage to Rome, for both of us…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: And who might you be?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m the steward of Lucinnius the merchant…
we have business in Rome… I need an immediate passage…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s five or six days… to Brundisium… you
can walk or ride from there… you have money?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Well, let’s see… passage for two… food for
two… six days… what were you thinking of offering?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: When do you leave?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Anxious to leave, are you?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Keen to start, yes.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. ship - day 49</strong>: Hector and Thalia are asleep,
huddled together in a cor- ner of the ship that they have claimed as
their quarters.</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: Captain says to come on deck.</p>
<p><strong>50 ext. ship - day 50</strong>: There is no sign of land
behind them. The ship is moving swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a
light sea. We can tell from Thalia’s reactions that she has never been
out at sea before, at least never above deck. Every- thing is novel to
her and it shows, even the movement of the ship. Her excitement is
childlike.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: Where’s the land gone?</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: Have you been on a ship before?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: Me, too, but they kept us down there.</p>
<p><strong>thalia</strong>: Tonight… we’ll be where the thunder is!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Thought you would like to see them.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Your master’s ships… going home…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No… they can’t be… they’re lost…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: No they’re not… I know these ships… my
brother-in-law’s the master of the big one with the brown sail…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Somebody been putting the wind up
Lucinnius? That’s an old one… didn’t think anybody’d fall for that…</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. ship - day 51</strong>: Later, the ship is still
making brisk progress. Thalia and Hector are sitting on deck, some
distance from one another. They are quieter now, more thoughtful. Hector
catches her eye. Hector is drawn by her smile and moves to join her.
They sit quietly, absorbed in thought, thoughts of each other, their
looks and smiles tell us that. As if they are talking without words.
Hector looks around him. A sailor on the forward deck is sorting out
some rope, an echo of a previous time and place. The wind catches the
sailor’s hat. He grabs it from the air and spends time arranging it once
more on his head, just so. A tiny human moment.</p>
<p><strong>52 ext. wagon - day 52</strong>: A man is driving a heavy
two-horse wagon. The wind has just lifted his hat from his head. He
spends some time replacing it carefully, just so. Watching him from the
back of the wagon is Hector. The drama of the lives of Thalia and Hector
has played itself out long ago. Between the breath of sea breeze that
lifted the hat of the Roman sailor and the gust of mountain wind that
snatches the hat of the wagoner, lies 1400 years.</p>
<p><strong>52 continued: 52</strong>: The woman and Hector exchange
glances now and then, delicate signals of mutual awareness. Talking
without words. They are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load
of timber. With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of about eight. The
Girl is tearful. A man, his face unseen, is snoring underneath his hat.
A younger man, gaunt and hungry-looking, is dressed in the rough
travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST. Even without his habit we would
know he was a holy man. His incessant talk tells us.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: We want to praise God because we live in
this ultimate age, when all things are done, all is known, all the
wonders of his creation revealed to us… nothing more for man to see or
do… all that is left is the hope of salvation… even for our humbler
sisters…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Yes weep, child, weep for joy… you are a
glorious example to us all… already a child of God’s… blessed to spend
your earthly days within his church as Christ’s servant… what generous
parents you have… giving you to the sisters… What a sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: She’s already received the last rites, before
she left her family. She belongs to God now… Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Fortunate child, destined for paradise.
Untouched by the abiding curse of carnal lust. I struggle against
it…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I will not join myself carnally with any
woman…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: … I will carry my unspilt seed from this
world to the next… as should every man…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: … If all men forsook forever the fleshy
temptations… and held womankind to barrenness… think how much the sooner
would come the day of judgement… all God’s chosen gathered in paradise…
I’ve written a small treatise in favor of virginity, sister. We could
discuss it later if you like…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: It’s simple, brother… if we cease carnal
union entirely then in fifty or so years we’ll all be rid of our earthly
lives and God can proceed with His reign over His heavenly kingdom… that
same paradise that God gave to man before, but which man was so unfit to
inhabit that within seven hours Eve was already tempting her master and
mate, and within nine hours the Lord had to expel the both of them! Just
think, they messed it up in nine hours!</p>
<p><strong>53 ext. mountain track - day 53</strong>: Hector smiles as
the Priest’s VOICE FADES into the dis- tance. It is a cold fresh day of
early summer. They are travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles
on his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket. The last
sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector
lays himself down at the side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then
a SOUND in the distance makes him open them again. He listens. MORE
SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley. He stands up and
crosses the track. At first he can see nothing. He walks back along the
rim of the road. Then he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted
skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge crosses the small
river, at the very bottom of the valley. There are no more than 30
knights in full armor, with twice as many foot soldiers and squires.
Even from such a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is
ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this distance it is like
a puppet show, except the violence is real. The scene places Hector in
his time and for us there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if
Hector has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to some
distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is where he belongs, in
Medieval Europe. Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him
he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise citizen of a
violent age, Hector knows when to leg it.</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. wagon - day 54</strong>: Hector catches up with the
moving wagon and jumps onto it, happily back in the security of his
fellow travellers. He smiles at Beatrice.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: A bit cold… walking…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How long to get there?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: When it gets dark, we’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I thought I heard fighting… back there…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I don’t know what you’re saying… I haven’t
understood anything you’ve said all day…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t know what you’re saying…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I don’t know what you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I want to go home to my mother.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Just bread and water for me, Mistress. I
have no need of wine or meat.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. farmhouse - night 57</strong>: In the dark, sleeping
bodies lie all over the floor of an upstairs room. Gentle snores and
regular breathing lay a blanket of soft sound over the human forms.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. farmhouse - night 58</strong>: Hector creeps
cautiously into the dark kitchen. The figure has gone to the pantry and
can be heard RUMMAGING there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is
the Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth as he hunts
for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under his arm. He emerges from the
pantry. He sees Hector standing by the table. They recognize one another
and relax. The Priest doesn’t re-enter his holy act. He speaks normally,
cheekily.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: God, I’m starving. Do you think I dare heat
that up on the fire?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: No… I’ll eat it cold… I deserve to
suffer.</p>
<p><strong>58 continued: 58</strong>: Then he digs his hands into the
cold stew and eats chunks of meat as they talk.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Have some wine.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I saw some fighting today… back up the
road…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: So, the mad knights are at it again… what
were they, Swiss or English?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t know. They all look the same to
me.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: It might help us get through… if there’s a
bit of confusion… we’ll still travel separately though, for now.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: But, Hector, you must keep out of the way of
temptation… I saw the way you were eyeing up that widow… now stay away
from that… although she is beautiful, is she not… but we’re going home,
remember.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How do you know she’s a widow?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Look at her eyes… hungry eyes… she could
lead you into trouble… she smells like paradise, though.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Listen, Hector, let’s get this clear… if
anyone’s going to dally with that widow it’ll be me… you couldn’t handle
her… she’d bewitch you… at any rate, you’re not a sinning kind of
fellow, are you… why don’t you get off up the road tomorrow, and I’ll
catch you up, in five or so days…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You’re not a sinning fellow, remember…
another month and we’ll be at the channel, then home… the little ones
you only talk about when you’re drunk… don’t forget them…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Why do I always talk so much… you weren’t
even thinking of her ’til I opened my mouth… but I trust you… don’t
worry. I know you wouldn’t do anything to anger your God, or me. Get me
some bread.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Who saved your neck in Venice?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You did, Ronald.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: And don’t you forget it.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: May the Lord forgive us our sins, those we
have committed and those we as yet only dream of. She’s a glory of a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>58 continued: 58</strong>: For all his wit and endless talk
we can sense a trace of vulnerabililty in Ronald. For all his bluster,
there is the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims Hector
needs him.</p>
<p><strong>60 int. farmhouse - day 60</strong>: The travellers look out
on the exciting scene, and talk as they eat their breakfast of bread and
milk.</p>
<p><strong>pedlar</strong>: Hostages, too, they’ve got… they only take
the rich ones…</p>
<p><strong>pedlar</strong>: Have you ever seen so many fine, rich men,
my girl?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I won’t be travelling today.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The fighting’s behind us, brother … you’ll
be safe enough.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You should go.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: We’re going. God will protect his ewe
lambs.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Must be sore in there. Is it your dada?</p>
<p><strong>soldier #2</strong>: If he’s got a little head it might be
alright. Has your dada got a big head?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Is there a blacksmith here? Where’s the
smith?</p>
<p><strong>farm woman</strong>: In the village, sir, half a day
away.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: You, Priest, come here… get to work on him…
he’s not ready for heaven yet… there’s a hundred thousand livres on his
head if I get him to Paris alive… Start praying… there’s fifteen livres
in it for you if he lives…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Get that helmet off… get hammers, anything
you can find… and one of you get back down into the valley and fetch an
armorer.</p>
<p><strong>61 ext. farm - day 61</strong>: More soldiers have continued
to make their way to the shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of
war. Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the medicos or
the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups. Everyone looks for food.
Individual soldiers, like lost souls, run here and there trying to
regroup with their comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir-
teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in expensive
armor.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I think you know what I’m saying … a
little…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: No, I don’t, I don’t understand a
word.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How come you don’t speak like anyone else?
Are you far from home? Home? Where you sleep and live?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I think I know what you mean… home.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m far from home, too… way, way over there…
then across the sea…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You’re losing me again.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Have you ever seen the sea? Water
everywhere… right to the end of the world… I come from the other side of
the little water, then there’s the big, big water… I had a friend who
sailed on that… went too far… fell right over the edge… into nothing.
They never came back… they fell off the world…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You think that’s funny? It’s true… it’s a
sad story… you shouldn’t laugh.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Talk about home again… remember you said
home?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m not making sense, am I? Well, let’s go
back to homes. That’s where I’m going… I’ve been away for too long… Some
people locked me up… I had to run away.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Tell me something else.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We have to learn to talk the same… try it
like me, say it… home…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I know what you’re saying… you’re saying
home… say something else.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Home… home… try it… home…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You want the word for home? It’s home… say
it… home… home…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t want your word for home, I want you
to say mine… home… home…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Come on, you can do it… home… home…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Home… home…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: That’s it… clever boy!</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Tick… it’s a tick.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Flea… a flea… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Bet there’s more in there. You need a good
going over… nobody’s been looking after you.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Why don’t we go somewhere and have a good
session… I could do you… I’d like to give you a good grooming…</p>
<p><strong>62 int. farm - day 62</strong>: Ronald the Priest still
kneels by the inert knight in armor. The boy Squire still sits by his
father’s head. Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight
is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or moaning. The suit of
armor seems to grow even more rigid as we look at it. There is no sense
of it containing life. The Officer re-enters the room from outside.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Sleeping now… at peace, for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Leave him for a while. There are a few
souls out here you can help on their way to heaven. Ten sous a soul to
you… come on.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Twenty sous is normal. How many are
there?</p>
<p><strong>63 ext. farm - day 63</strong>: Hector and Beatrice have
found some privacy, near the trees and by a low wall. Some bushes hide
them from full view of the farm yard. Hector is sitting cross- legged
and Beatrice kneels behind him, giving his head a thorough going over.
Mutual grooming is the original, and perhaps the best, form of foreplay.
Hector certainly likes it.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: That’s four.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes, it does feel good.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You can do me now.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Got one… a tiny little one… yours are so
small… and fair…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t know your name. I’m Hector… who are
you? I’m Hector.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Hector… yes… I’m Beatrice…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Beatrice.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Yes. Hector… I think you’ll have to do
under my arms… I’m a little itchy there…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes, I think Beatrice is a good name.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Maybe we should find the river, and have a
proper wash…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I’m still itchy lots of places,
Hector.</p>
<p><strong>64 ext. farmyard - day 64</strong>: The Priest is with some
seriously wounded soldiers, laid out in a corner of the farmyard.
Whether he is a bogus priest or not, Ronald is taking his duties
seriously. There is a little of the rogue about him now. He sees the Nun
and the little Girl preparing to leave. They have acquired a mule. They
mount up, the Girl behind the Nun, and plod off through the farmyard.
They stop briefly beside the Priest to say their farewells.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Goodbye, little girl… the Lord will bless
you, I know, in his house.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: How long for you on the road?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Three or four days.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: They’re not killing nuns, yet.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The Saxon, won’t he go with you?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: He’s nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>65 ext. track - day 65</strong>: The Nun’s mule turns out of
the farmyard and heads off along the track. A few Soldiers are burying
some of their dead nearby. The Nun watches this and doesn’t see what the
Girl sees on the other side, the mingled bodies of Hector and Beatrice,
all pretence at grooming now gone, engaged in fervent lovemaking. It’s
probably the first and last that the Girl will see. A smile flickers
across her face before she turns away forever. Ahead of her there might
be many a bleak night in her convent when she will remember the image,
and that same smile will return to her lips.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: My name is Peter… don’t forget … tell
everybody that was my name… Peter…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Lie still, Peter…</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: That’s it, Peter… tell everybody … write
it… don’t forget it… Peter… tell them Peter died here … my name is
Peter… Peter… say it again.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>67 int. farmhouse - night 67</strong>: The Priest makes his
way upstairs in the darkness. He yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has
completed the hardest day’s work that he has undertaken as a priest, if
he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre- tence has been just
as exhausting. He wants to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>68 int. farmhouse - another angle - night 68</strong>: In the
room sleeping forms lie here and there in the darkness. Some officers
have moved in and the place is more crowded than before. The Priest
makes his way to his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She
snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long sniff at her,
then he sighs out his admiration.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. farmhouse - day 69</strong>: The Priest wakes up.
Outside he can hear the first sounds of the day, the murmuring VOICES of
Soldiers in the yard, the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS. In the room it is still
semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have already left, but
Beatrice is there, stretching herself and fixing her hair. Hector is not
with her. She smiles at the Priest. Then, in another part of the room,
Hector emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up and
smiles too.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>70 ext. farmyard - day 70</strong>: Hector is washing himself
by the stream that flows close by the yard. He drinks a handful of water
for breakfast. The Priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join
him. Hector is in a cheerful mood, pleased with himself and his success
with Beatrice. The Priest is sullen, reproachful.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’re a busy man, what with all these souls
departing.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with helping someone
to die in peace. They want me to go with them.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Are you staying here?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Moving on, as you told me to… we’ll meet up,
like you said. I’ll wait for you at the channel.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: She’ll do you harm. I told you. She might be
a witch. Wait for me. I still have the money from Venice. We can be home
in a month.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Witch my arse. Stop giving me orders.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’re a strange fellow. Are you a priest?
Are you jealous?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: We’re moving soon, Father.</p>
<p><strong>70 continued: 70</strong>: The Priest turns to Hector for
what might be the last time.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: So, you’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You have work to do here.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t understand you.</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. track - day 71</strong>: Hector and Beatrice have
packed their few belongings into a shoulder bag. They turn out of the
farmyard and walk down the main track. Hector catches a last glimpse of
the Priest being helped onto the back of a horse, behind a Soldier. He
is ridden off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop.
Other battles lie ahead to be blessed, and more battered bodies
requiring comfort. Hector and Beatrice are enjoying the first pulse-
quickening flush of their intimacy, and the thrill of knowing it will go
further. They chatter freely, despite not sharing a language.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m glad we’re going the same way.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: We’ll have to sleep in the hills tonight.
Will you keep me warm?</p>
<p><strong>72 ext. hillside - day 72</strong>: Hector and Beatrice have
stopped to eat. They shelter in the fold of a hillside, with a wide
stream running some way below. Hector feeds Beatrice a piece of cheese
from his knife.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Hurry up and finish your wine and then we
can make love.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Why do you smell so wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Oh, you like my smell, do you? I make it
from the flowers. I put it here, and there, and there.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I don’t believe it… someone’s watching us,
the dirty devil… don’t look… he’s down by the water, by the rocks…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Cheeky devil.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: He’s not moving. He must’ve seen us,
though.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Don’t look at him anymore. Let’s go… down
the other side of the hill.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Come on, we’re going that way at any
rate.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No sign of a battle… only a few horses… or
just one. He wasn’t killed in a fight.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Poor boy. Isn’t he fine-looking. Look at
his shoes.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: We’ll cover his eyes at least… so the
crows don’t get him. Look at these shoes, though.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: That’s good of you.</p>
<p><strong>73 continued: 73</strong>: Hector helps her by gathering
stones from the stream. Soon they have covered his head completely with
stones, his body lying exposed.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s all we can do. It won’t keep the wolves
away though.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: His feet are like mine, you know. I’ll
give you mine, poor boy, and I’ll have yours. I have more walking to
do.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: It’s not stealing if I give him mine, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’ve put magic in this stuff, haven’t you,
you’re bewitching me…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You’re eager today, Hector, aren’t you? Is
it all this death?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t know what you’re saying but I like
you when you talk.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: That should help him a little.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We should go now. We’ve been here too
long.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I wonder if his mama will ever know what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You said mama. I know what that is… mama… We
can talk the same…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Mama… that’s right… mama…</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. hillside - another angle - day 76</strong>: They have
reached the summit of the hills. It is like the roof of the world. Below
them lies the valley. The air is clean. The landscape looks untouched by
man, but a few smudges of smoke in the distance suggest farms or
villages. There might be the glimpse of a castle on a hill.</p>
<p><strong>76 continued: 76</strong>: If it all feels oddly familiar to
us, then perhaps it is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story
book, or an ancient landscape on a gallery wall. Once again in the film
there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not from a dream, but in a
dream.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I have to keep the sun on my back, that’s
what Ronald said… the sun on my back all the way home… I’ll stay on this
side of the river…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Yes, of course… we stay on this side of
the river, all the way down… until tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I stay on this side…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Yes… On this side. Then the other.</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. forest - day 77</strong>: Beatrice is milking a stray
cow they have found in the forest. Hector is watching her, especially
her hands. She manipulates the udders of the cow deftly, sexily. Her
hands seem to have sensual personalities all of their own. She is
chattering non-stop, explaining the subtleties of milking to Hector. But
he can’t take his eyes or his mind off her thrilling hands. He responds
distractedly.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Oh yes… oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>78 continued: 78</strong>: We feel the echo of another night
when a man watched someone sleep and dream.</p>
<p><strong>79 ext. forest - morning 79</strong>: Hector and Beatrice are
on the move again. They make their way down into the thickening forest.
Beatrice walks ahead, light-footed and humming to herself. She seems to
be in comfortably familiar territory now. The mist swirls about him as
Hector follows on behind, tagging along as if caught in her sexual
wake.</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. boat - day 80</strong>: Hector and Beatrice have
reached the river, broad and slow-moving. Beatrice has hailed a boatman
from the far side. He maneuvers his small boat to them and they clamber
aboard. Beatrice and the boatman greet each other familiarly. They
gossip amiably as the ferry makes its way across the river. Hector sits
quietly with a smile on his face, their chatter incomprehensible to
him.</p>
<p><strong>81 ext. shore - day 81</strong>: As they climb out of the
ferry Hector is suddenly unsure of what he is doing.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I think we’re going the wrong way. I want
the sun on my back. We should have stayed on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Don’t worry… we’re nearly there. I’ll fix
your back for you… give you a good rub.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. cottage - day 83</strong>: Beatrice turns to him when
they are inside.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Here we are… home… you want some food… and
then I’ll show you everything. We have a spring … you can wash…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: This is when I wish you could understand
me. You’ll have to learn, you know… I want you to stay here. You want
to, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I look after the hens, and I make dyes
from the plants, and perfumes too. I’m good at that. But I’m no good
with the sheep and the goats. I wish you could understand… Arnaud’s been
dead two years…</p>
<p><strong>83 continued: 83</strong>: She lifts the lid and removes some
men’s clothing, rough working trousers and a hide jacket.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I still have his clothes. I’ll make them
fit you…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What did he die of?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I’m getting shy. Imagine me being shy with
you… I made this for him… tonight we’ll try them on. You’re the same
height as Arnaud, but a little thinner. I’ll make them fit. I’m a good
sewer. And we have a big bed upstairs for you and me, in the rafters…
You and me… sleep…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I like you. You like me too, don’t you? We
were lucky to meet the way we did. All the men around here are old.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Come up and I’ll show you the bed…</p>
<p><strong>84 continued: 84</strong>: The bed takes up most of the space
of the small attic. They look at it together.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: A good bed, eh? For you and me. We can
have fun up here… better than a ditch…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Mama, are you home?</p>
<p><strong>85 int. cottage - day 85</strong>: Beatrice and Hector
descend back in the room. A BOY of about eight and a GIRL of ten are
coming in from the garden. They have been working outside. Beatrice goes
to embrace each of them. Hector’s face is a confusion once again.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You were gone a long time. Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: This is Hector.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: These are my children…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: … and this is my mother….</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: So… you found one, eh?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Is there water… to drink… to wash?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Take Hector to the well… but come here
first.</p>
<p><strong>86 ext. well - day 86</strong>: Hector stands at the well
some way from the house. Beatrice’s garden is a madness of wild flowers,
harvested by her for scents and powders. She is a remarkable woman,
living as she does in the harsh male world of her time. The scented air
and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the BEES almost make Hector swoon. He is
experiencing the full, heady impact of Beatrice, and it is summed up in
a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze. He drinks at her well. The Boy is
beside him, still engrossed in his new shoes. Hector splashes some water
on his face and looks back at the house. He has some decisions to
make.</p>
<p><strong>87 int. cottage - day 87</strong>: The Mother sits by the
window in the nearest thing to a comfortable chair that the house has to
offer. She is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to watch her.
He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The Mother thinks he wants her
chair for himself. In a flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and
motions for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of
embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No, no… sit down… I just came to watch…
please… sit…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We can’t have this… this was Arnaud’s seat…
it’s yours now… I can sit on the box…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You must sit there… look… you need the light
from the window… it’s your seat… I don’t want it… it’s yours… I can sit
on the box.</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. yard - day 88</strong>: Hector has retreated to the
yard. The Girl is boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. The
Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling petals and
separating the hearts, putting them in a large jar of colored liquid.
Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him. She is returning to the
kitchen, firmly holding a struggling chicken, wings flapping and
feathers flying everywhere. This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice
in Beatrice’s final effort at total seduction, a wonderful meal. Hector
is guiltily aware of this as their eyes meet briefly. Hector takes in
what the Boy is doing and joins in the work. The Boy smiles at Hector’s
initial clumsiness. He motions for Hector to have a sniff of the jar of
liquid. Hector does so. The smell is heady and pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Ah…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Good color… for cloth?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Ugh…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Peepee?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Mmmm… good food….</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Take a walk to the village if you want…
you look as if you need a walk…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I have to leave soon. I can’t stay… it would
be wrong to stay for just a while…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I have to go… have to keep the sun on my
back… I have to get home… I have a family, just like you… I like you…
you smell good… wonderful…</p>
<p><strong>92 ext. river - dusk 92</strong>: Hector has reached the
river, but it is already growing dark and the boatman has gone for the
night. Hector sees the boat, dragged out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>93 ext. raft - morning 93</strong>: Hector awakes. He looks
around him. He is on a huge raft, made of ship’s timbers. We have left
our previous Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. This Hector is
awakening into what might be a nightmare. The huge raft is many smaller
rafts lashed together. There are over a hundred and fifty people perched
on them, lying or squatting in sleep. It is early morning. The sea is
calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is still there to remind them
of their predicament, menacing, like a controlled anger.</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: Andre is Hector’s slave, still
bound to him in service through shipwreck and disaster. Our Hector is
now a master. Andre is a young Asian. A quiet, capable, intelligent man,
but with that same lost look in his eyes that Hector had as a slave. He
too is far from home.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I had a wonderful dream. I was lying under a
tree, beside a river. I was dozing. I heard the water… beautiful clear
water. I got up and drank some. I think I ate some raspberries too.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: I would like some water.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: God, this is the worst, the worst.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Let me keep him… they said we’ll find land in
a day or so… you’re evil…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: When they’re dead they go over the side… The
place stinks enough as it is…</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Do you think I’ll still see Europe?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I think there’s more chance of me eating
you, Andre.</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: The more we see of the people,
their costumes, weapons, mannerisms, the easier we will place them in
their time. They are survivors of a foundered ship some time at the
height of the great colonial empires. The year could be 1590. The place
is the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: I think today will be the day, my
friends. We’ve been in the inshore currents since yesterday. Three
crowns to the first one to sight the coast. God preserve us all.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Never mind the three crowns… a side of beef
would do… or a drink of clean water.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Don’t worry, there’ll be food for all
ashore. Africa’s full of meat and drink.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It’s full of Africans too.</p>
<p><strong>94 continued: 94</strong>: Hector works his oar with the
rest. He has time to cast a glance at Ursula and Francisco. Francisco in
his manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time trying to
offer a steadying arm to Ursula. If Hector had time or energy to laugh,
he would.</p>
<p><strong>95 continued: 95</strong>: Some of the survivors have
recovered sufficiently from the trauma of near death to mark out the
boundaries of their new beach homes with lines of stones. The habits of
ownership die hardest of all. Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority
he is also a man in deep shock. Most of what he has earned or plundered
in his colonial years now lies at the bottom of the ocean. Since he is
socially superior to anyone else on the ship he assumes responsibility
and command. There are probably fifty men among the survivors more
suited to lead them to safety. By Dom Paulo’s side always is his SON. A
quiet boy of about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his father,
dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a constant, silent witness
to everything that Dom Paulo does, good or bad, wise or foolish. He and
his father are a continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy
Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the absurdities and
comedies of the situation can be high- lighted in this way. There can be
sadness in it too however, the pain of a son witnessing his father’s
compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo’s sad awareness
of his image slowly tarnishing in his son’s eyes. Amidst the
construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with some of his OFFICERS.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: How many made it?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Eighty men. Ten women. Eighteen children
and forty-five slaves.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Two parties of ten men each… one to the
north and one to the south… bring back what you can… game, fruit,
anything… and send someone back as soon as you find fresh water. Any
trouble, discharge three shots.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Have the carpenter start immediately on a
cross, a big one… Father Diogo wants a place of worship by this time
tomorrow. We’ll look for a spot later. We’ve all got a lot of praying to
do. And where’s Dias… tell him I want to see him.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. camp - day 96</strong>: Hector and Andre are walking
through the half-built village. Andre is carrying Hector’s possessions,
a rolled-up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth. We feel an echo of the
days when Hector was a slave, walking two paces behind with his master’s
possessions. Hector finds what he is looking for. Francisco is working
on a shelter for himself and Ursula, with the help of some slaves.
Hector approaches him, making another attempt to heal wounds from his
past.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I have a carpet and some cloth… I thought if
we worked together we could make a better shelter…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: If it’s a joke it’s a poor one.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: At least ask Dona Ursula…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I don’t have to ask her… I know she would
agree with me… leave us alone.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well… would you take my cloth, at least?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Keep it and build your own hovel
somewhere else… leave us alone…!</p>
<p><strong>96 continued: 96</strong>: Then from along the beach the
sound of RAISED VOICES distracts them. They see some figures, laden with
supplies, running off into the forest. Others are following them,
discharging MUSKETS, shouting for the DESERTERS to stop. Hector and
Francisco walk briskly in the direction of the trouble. They see two of
the Deserters being overtaken by their pursuers. The rest make their
escape into the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: They ran off with the dry bread… about eight
of them, sir…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: You men are deserters. You will die
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Chain them on the raft for tonight, and
watch them…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I must object… these sentences can’t be
lawful…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Of course… we can’t allow ourselves to
fall into terror and violence…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: You’re right… but then how can we punish
them? We can’t lock them up…</p>
<p><strong>97 continued: 97</strong>: Dom Paulo looks around at the
assembled notables, confused, out of his depth. Other opinions are
voiced.</p>
<p><strong>salgado</strong>: You were right the first time, sir… they
must hang… they were stealing the bread from our mouths…</p>
<p><strong>young deserter</strong>: I didn’t steal any bread… Gomes had
the bread… he’s off, in the forest…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Oh dear…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: What do you think, Father?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I’ll comfort them whether they live or die,
now or later, any of you, all of you… I’ll comfort you all.</p>
<p><strong>salgado</strong>: Hang them… you have to set an example…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: So I was right the first time?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: No, sir… there must be proper
justice…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: What’s proper justice?</p>
<p><strong>deserter</strong>: I didn’t steal any bread…</p>
<p><strong>salgado</strong>: You have to make a decision, sir.</p>
<p><strong>deserter</strong>: It was Gomes… he told us to run.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: I’ll decide… no I won’t… we’ll all
decide… most of the people that matter are here… we’ll have a vote… who
agrees with Salgado… and me… that they should die?</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: … and those against death…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: You can’t vote…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Can he?</p>
<p><strong>salgado</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>salgado</strong>: I don’t think this is working, Dom Paulo…
we need authority… you must decide…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Very well… Da Cunha?</p>
<p><strong>97 continued: 97</strong>: DA CUNHA steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: The cross the carpenter is working on…
tell him to turn it into a scaffold… have it erected along the beach,
away from the women… the executions will be at sunrise tomorrow. Tell
Father Diogo.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Take them to the raft.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Everyone in agreement with hanging? Or
should we shoot them… or what?</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: Hanging is fine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Very well… now… who’s going to conduct
the executions… should we pick someone, or have a volunteer…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Hector?</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: I’ll do it, Dom Paulo.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Thank you, Alvarez. Sunrise tomorrow.
Send the Priest to them tonight.</p>
<p><strong>98 ext. camp - evening 98</strong>: It is growing dark. Fires
are being lit outside the shelters. Andre is building Hector’s tent
while Hector watches him. The tent is only large enough for one person,
and somehow looks mean compared with the others.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Good work, Andre.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You go and sleep by the big fire, Andre.
Keep warm.</p>
<p><strong>99 int. camp - night 99</strong>: Hector goes inside his
little house. He puts his back to the entrance and opens the canvas sack
which contains all his possessions. He pulls out his prize, a sizeable
chunk of bread and some dried fruit. He guiltily gnaws at the hard
bread. He is surprised by the sound of the boy, Nuno outside.</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: Senor Hector?</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: This was all they found in the forest. Four
for each of us. They taste kind of milky, but sour.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Thank you, Nuno.</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: My mother ate three and she was sick. So try
two… but she’s sick anyway… maybe you can try three…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ll start with two.</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: Hector, will you help me?</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: Lopo… the boy they’re going to hang tomorrow…
he was cook’s cabin boy… I was going to take him something to eat… I
thought, perhaps, one of yours and one of mine…</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: You said you might just eat two…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: But there’s tomorrow, Nuno… we must eat
tomorrow too…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Dom Paulo would call it a waste. You must
keep yourself strong, Nuno, that’s what he’d say… so that you can help
the others… God knows what we have ahead of us… we’ll need strong people
like you…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Try not to think about Lopo any more… The
guards wouldn’t let you near him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Goodnight!</p>
<p><strong>100 int. camp - night 100</strong>: In the privacy of their
tent Dom Paulo and his son are engaged in their nightly ritual,
practicing on their recorders. Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an
intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is an air of
stoicism about them, determined as they are to maintain their civilized
habits in these bleakest of circumstances. But there is also a feeling
of madness about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of what is
going on about him. Down on the beach men are waiting to die in the
morning on his orders. The blend of formality and madness make the scene
comic.</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: Some gunpowder would scatter them,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: No, they might want to be friendly…
they’ll have food too… get one of our African slaves… we must try and
talk to them… If they think we’re timid we’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>102 ext. dunes - dawn 102</strong>: A solitary SLAVE makes
his way up from the camp to the natives on the dunes. Everyone in the
camp watches as he approaches them. There is tension. Will the natives
run or fight or talk. They begin to talk. The natives seem most
interested in the hangings, and point in that direction, asking
questions. The Slave makes an attempt at explaining what is happening,
but the natives seem baffled. They start laughing and shaking their
heads. By now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the cross
making an efficient double-gallows.</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. camp - dawn 103</strong>: While Francisco’s
attention has been on the natives, Hector has sidled up to him, still
hoping to ingratiate himself. He talks while they watch the two events,
the hanging and the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I hate it when people have to die.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: It’s foolishness. Killing our own men
when we have the whole of Africa to face.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s foolish squabbling at all. We should be
friends.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Some bread and raisins.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I thought everything was shared out on
the raft…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well this wasn’t. It’s for her… and you.</p>
<p><strong>103 continued: 103</strong>: On the high dunes the Slave and
the natives have now parted company. The Deserters still spin at the end
of their ropes, the Priest praying at their feet. Francisco walks away
from him. Hector calls out.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I must speak to her!</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: They want to make a visit here… with their
King… he will bring gifts, and will receive gifts. They said not to
sacrifice anymore men for them… they don’t like that…</p>
<p><strong>105 ext. bay - day 105</strong>: The tide is sweeping more
wreckage into the bay. Barrels and boxes and timber bob in the waves.
People make their way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from
the sea. The whole of the camp is eager and shouting. They bring in the
boxes and barrels. A whole harmonium is man- handled ashore. Some boys
drag it up onto dry sand and start to work its bellows. At first only
water spurts from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. The mood
soon becomes festive. Dom Paulo makes his way down to the shore to make
the celebrations official. By now the first of the newly-arrived crates
are being opened. Inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in crate after
crate. An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Turtles’ eggs, sir… Doctor Correa was
shipping them to the Royal Zoo… I think they hoped some of them would
hatch.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Well… it’s eggs for supper tonight… for
everyone…</p>
<p><strong>106 ext. camp - dusk 106</strong>: That night everyone does
eat turtles’ eggs. At their fires in the dusk they fry them, boil them,
scramble them. Some eat them raw. The abundant green fruits make a
tolerable side dish. The happy mood of the afternoon has survived into
the night. For once there is enough to eat, and the hangings are a thing
of the past. Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF the CROAKY
sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be heard.</p>
<p><strong>107 int. hector’s tent - dusk 107</strong>: Sadly for Hector,
the harmonium enthusiast is very close to his shelter. The JANGLY MUSIC
is loud and insistent. Hector removes six large eggs from a bag and
takes them outside to his fire.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. camp - dusk 108</strong>: Andre is there eating the
last of his omelette.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How are they?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yours were fine?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Have you any eggs left?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: The slaves only got three. I want to ask you
something.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You were lucky. What?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: I want my real name back.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You don’t like Andre anymore?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: I think of my home all the time. I want to
hear the name they call me. We should die with our real names.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We’re not going to die, Andre…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ve forgotten your name…</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Ketabomago Pululo.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Now I remember why we called you Andre.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I will, Andre… I promise… I’ll call you
that… when I remember…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Good night… Keta…</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Ketabomago Pululo…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes… good night…</p>
<p><strong>108 continued: 108</strong>: Hector is alone. Hector gives up
on the eggs and pulls out his store of bread and fruit from the tent.
The next source of annoyance is the continuing noise of the</p>
<p><strong>harmonium.</strong>: He shouts across to the musical
enthusiast, a YOUTH with a few older children by his side.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hey! Stop that, will you? Think of the older
people, and the sick… I’ll give you an egg if you stop… here…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: How many are sick?</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: About fifty, sir, some of them very sick
indeed. It’s the eggs. A couple of the crates were full of rotten ones,
but eaten just the same. Others just ate too many. It would have been
better to ration them, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: How wise of you to think of that now. Any
deaths?</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: How many eggs did you have?</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: Three. I had them boiled.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: I had four. I don’t feel well now…</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: Four’s all right… the really ill ones had
eaten eight, ten…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Let’s not think about it… what have you
got?</p>
<p><strong>salgado</strong>: It worked well… they’ll go for this… and
nails… Luis cleaned up a sackful from the crates…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Organize some men to gather all the nails
they can find. We have to keep control of that particular currency.</p>
<p><strong>110 int. dom paulo’s tent - morning 110</strong>: Inside his
tent Dom Paulo goes to his small mirror. He takes off the heavy silver
chain and medallion from around his neck, and a valuable brooch from his
coat. He stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its hiding
place in the sand floor. Then he adorns himself in the cheap rosary and
other trashy items. Dom Paulo, catching sight of his watching Son in the
mirror, holds a silencing finger to his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>111 continued: 111</strong>: He quickly searches through
them. He soon finds what he is looking for, a piece of wood with some
nails still attached to it. He pulls out the nails and pockets them,
then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more. Hector is a
survivor. And not the first Hector to scavenge on a beach, in a world
that feels big and empty.</p>
<p><strong>112 ext. dunes - morning 112</strong>: Hector is enjoying the
freshness of the day. We see him climb over a dune and then as he nears
the summit duck and retreat down the slope again. Cautiously he crawls
up the dune and looks over to the other side.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Stop that… leave her alone… get back to the
camp… or I’ll tell your mother… how can you play like this when there
are people needing your help back there…?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Come back… I didn’t mean it… it was a joke…
you come back… she’s still here… I won’t say anything…</p>
<p><strong>112 continued: 112</strong>: But the Boy walks on, turning
around now and then to look at Hector, who feels foolish and mean.
Hector calls down to the Girl.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>113 ext. clearing - day 113</strong>: The meeting of the two
leaders is weird and wonderful to see. The ragged Europeans, already
scanning the baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food, somehow
still muster an absurd sense of their own importance for the occasion.
The Natives, excited and curious, trying to contain their exuberance so
that they don’t miss a single detail of this most significant day. Many
of the Natives have climbed into the trees, either out of timidity or to
get a better view</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: He was excited when he heard you had come,
but he wants to know if you are real people… he didn’t think you would
be such a strange color… so he wants to see your…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: … so that he will know that you were born
like real people…</p>
<p><strong>113 continued: 113</strong>: Dom Paulo won’t suffer the
indignity alone. He talks to the Officers standing closest to him.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Right… you four as well…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: He wants to see you breathe.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Tell him that we want to trade with him,
to buy food… and we want him to guide us out of here… we have a long way
to travel… to where the white men have their big ships…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: He has heard of white men very, very far
away… this way… but you have to cross many rivers… twenty big
rivers…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Tell him I want to give him these…</p>
<p><strong>113 continued: 113</strong>: The Officer produces a handful
of large nails and gives them directly to the King. The King nods his
head in approval and shows the nails to his attendants. They are
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: … and tell him that I want to make him a
very special gift as one King to another…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Of these precious things, which my
fathers and forefathers have worn for many long years before…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: I shouldn’t do this, but it is such a
special occasion, and he is such a great and worthy King…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: He says he could not accept such a treasured
gift, something of such value to your family… instead he would be happy
to take one or two of the old rings you have on your fingers… but please
do not insist that he take your necklace…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: He will give you guides to help you across
the first of the big rivers… it is ten days from here…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Thank you, thank you…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: … and he asks you to be ready to leave the
beach in two days time… he cannot permit you to stay longer…</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: Because with the new moon the turtles will
arrive and lay their eggs… you may frighten them… you must be gone…</p>
<p><strong>114 ext. beach - evening 114</strong>: The remains of the cow
hang on the spit over the large fire the survivors have made on the
beach. Small groups of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted
flesh. The image is once again timeless, the elements of it simple; man,
fire, flesh, food. One cow doesn’t go far between a hundred starving
people. Some are still on their feet by the large fire. Now and then a
hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a bone hanging loose or a
tasty-looking piece of gristle. They are the survivors of the pack, if
any will be.</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Suck out the marrow… it’s the best bit.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m sorry about today…</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: It doesn’t matter…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: But it does… it was mean of me… I was upset
at something… I wasn’t really angry at you…</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You don’t think too badly of me?</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You still like me?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well, that makes me feel better… we all have
to like each other… and respect each other… that’s important too.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: If you don’t respect me, just say so…</p>
<p><strong>114 continued: 114</strong>: Nuno looks at him, smiling
weakly. Then he turns away in silence. Hector tries another approach to
win the Boy over.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I have a boy like you… maybe you could meet
him when we get home…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You can take her back there tomorrow,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: No… she’s sick now…</p>
<p><strong>115 ext. camp - night 115</strong>: Dom Paulo and the Priest
and some of the Officers are having a more formal meal at Dom Paulo’s
table outside his shelter. An argument is in progress between Dom Paulo
and GASPAR DIAS, the navigator. Gasper Dias has drawn a rough map which
lies on the table.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Can’t you be more accurate?</p>
<p><strong>dias</strong>: How can I be accurate without instruments? As
it is I’m sighting the sun with two pieces of wood… Call it five hundred
and be done with it… he said twenty rivers.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: We just want you to be as accurate as we
know you can be, Dias. After all, the ship did manage to find that rock
with admirable precision.</p>
<p><strong>dias</strong>: Confound you, Dom Paulo, that’s an insult… she
hit that rock because she was taking water and unsteerable… She was
overloaded before she left India and you know it….</p>
<p><strong>dias</strong>: I’ve told you… we vote for a leader or you can
walk into the jungle on your own… it should have been done days ago…</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: Calm down, Dias… you can’t stay here
forever, living on turtles’ eggs…</p>
<p><strong>da cunha</strong>: What about the sick and the injured, Dom
Paulo…?</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: I’ve discussed it with Father Diogo… I
don’t see how a hundred of us can carry seventy sick…</p>
<p><strong>father diogo</strong>: I’m going to search the scriptures
tonight. I’m sure that God has an answer to it.</p>
<p><strong>dias</strong>: An excuse, you mean… we’ll be leaving them
here to die…</p>
<p><strong>salgado</strong>: Oh, so you’re coming with us now, Dias!</p>
<p><strong>115 continued: 115</strong>: Dias mumbles to himself.</p>
<p><strong>dias</strong>: After the vote…</p>
<p><strong>father diogo</strong>: It might be the best we can offer them
now… the chance to die a good Christian death here, and set an example
to the heathens…</p>
<p><strong>116 ext. camp - night 116</strong>: Hector is making his way
in the dark back to his shelter. He passes close to the tent of
Francisco and Ursula. Francisco is outside, by the fire. An impulse
takes Hector to join him.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ll be glad when we’re on the move… the
sound of the sea is driving me mad.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Good night, Hector…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Where is Ursula? Sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Sick. She hasn’t been able to rise since
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Will you share a bottle of wine with me?
I’ve had it since we left the ship… I want to drink it tonight, with
you.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: You have a bottle of wine?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Well, fetch it.</p>
<p><strong>117 ext. camp - night 117</strong>: Hector has returned with
his precious bottle. Francisco by some miracle has two fine crystal
glasses. As they drink they begin to reveal a hint of their old
intimacy.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: You should hang for this. Some people on
the raft might have lived with a glass of this in their stomach…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I know. I feel very guilty. I brought this
too…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Honeyed fruit. The last I have.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: You rogue… give it here…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I brought it for Ursula…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Much too rich for her… do you want to
kill her?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Surely… some fruit couldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Don’t argue with me, old friend… you’re
the guilty one around here, and don’t you forget it.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Why is it always me? Why am I always guilty,
always sorry… am I so bad?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: With Ursula you weren’t bad, you were
stupid… you did the one thing you can’t do to a strong woman… you took
away her pride… what else can she do but hate you?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: And then you get on the same ship… what a
fool…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I had to get home… just like you…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: And when the ship went down… why did you
have to get on the same raft… it was as if you were trying to torment
her…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: But… the other raft was sinking…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Francisco… please…</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. clearing - day 119</strong>: The natives have
gathered nearby. They have been moved, perhaps by the music, or perhaps
by the simple, universal posture of worship itself. They begin to sing,
a low, rhythmic, compelling chant. It mingles with the distant voice of
Father Diogo, and then with the chanting voices of all the Europeans,
until it seems that the whole world is praying.</p>
<p><strong>120 ext. camp - morning 120</strong>: Next morning the camp
on the beach is being broken up. The place is like a junkyard. The
amount of damage that a hundred and fifty people can do to a beach in
two days is impressive. Dom Paulo and the officers watch the work. With
them are some messengers from the king, and the Slave translator. One of
the messengers is talking. When he finishes, the Slave translates.</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: Yes… they will look after the sick… but the
King would like one thing… the machine that makes music…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: We need food as well… ten cows… to take
with us… then the King can have the music.</p>
<p><strong>121 ext. camp - another angle - morning 121</strong>: Hector
is sitting beside Nuno on a box, talking earnestly to him. Andre stands
beside them.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You must come with us.</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Your mother might not get well… do you
understand that?</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: That’s why I have to stay.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: And afterwards… what will you do then?</p>
<p><strong>nuno</strong>: Follow you and the others.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Let him be.</p>
<p><strong>122 ext. camp - day 122</strong>: Dom Paulo and Father Diogo
are standing beside Dom Paulo’s table, all that remains of his
headquarters on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>father diogo</strong>: I’ll comfort them as best as I
can.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: You’re staying with them?</p>
<p><strong>father diogo</strong>: No, no, I’ll comfort them before we
leave. I think my place is with you…</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. jungle path - day 123</strong>: The trek from the
beach to the village has started. A long line of people, including some
local natives, carry the sick in crudely-made litters. Even this short
trip is hard. Somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the harmonium
up the jungle path.</p>
<p><strong>123 continued: 123</strong>: Just behind them Hector is
helping Nuno to carry his Mother in a litter. It is like a civilization
on the move. In a day or two the wind and the sea will have rubbed out
all evidence of their stay, and the bay will welcome its regular
tenants, the turtles.</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. native village - day 124</strong>: There is a sense
of bustle in the native village as the European sick are settled into
their huts and the others prepare to depart. Emotional farewells take
place in dark corners of the small huts. A group of unmoved sailors are
playing cards in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Francisco… I have to see her before we
leave.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I’ll ask her.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: In you go.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Ursula… it’s Hector.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We’re leaving soon. I’ve come to say
goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I won’t forget you… I won’t forget India… I
can’t forget how I hurt you…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We should have talked… I could have
explained… many things…</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Lisbon…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes… I’ll pray for you in Lisbon… at the
Cathedral…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m sorry I hurt your pride…</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: What? What did you say? What are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Nothing, nothing…</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Idiot!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Ursula?</p>
<p><strong>126 ext. hut - day 126</strong>: Outside the hut, Dom Paulo
is talking with Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: We won’t forget you, or what you are
doing for these poor people…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I’m not staying here with the intention
of dying, Dom Paulo… we’ll be following you… when we are fit and
well…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: Yes, of course…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: … and good luck to you…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: God protect you… it breaks my heart to
leave you all here, but I don’t know what else I can do.</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: We’re leaving the cross with you…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Oh, thank you…</p>
<p><strong>dom paulo</strong>: It’s too heavy to carry… and who knows…
it might make some impression on the heathens.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Francisco, I must talk to you alone…</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. hut - another angle - day 127</strong>: Hector takes
Francisco by the arm and leads him behind the hut.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: You’ve made your peace with her?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes. I think so…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Thank, God… Well, goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Is there anything that I can do for you? A
letter… a message?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: No… if you were carrying something for me
I would have to worry about you… if you go empty-handed I can put you
out of my mind!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I want to ask you something. There’s no easy
way to do it…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Go on, Hector…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Your boots…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Can I have them? You can have mine… they’ll
be fine for here… but I have to walk six hundred miles…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Yes, you’re right… I daresay my boots
would take you six hundred miles… I look after them…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ll walk all the way home, Francisco… I’ll
pray for your soul in the Cathedral in Lisbon…</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: … In my boots…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Hector, you have surpassed yourself… sit
down and take my boots!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: They were made by Da Fosca, weren’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: The best bootmaker in Goa… pray for my
soul in Lisbon, Hector… and pray for your own…</p>
<p><strong>128 ext. forest - day 128</strong>: A different forest. A
wilderness of giant pines, ranging through the mountains for hundred of
miles. It is late in the year. There is one human sound in the cold
still- ness, a voice singing. BOBBY, the owner of the voice, has a pack
on his back. He is making his way up a steep slope to an area of flat
ground. He stops singing, looks around, and calls out in a powerful
voice.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They’ve gone… long gone!</p>
<p><strong>128 continued: 128</strong>: Up the slope and INTO VIEW comes
his companion, leading a laden pack horse. It is Hector.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They’ve been gone a week, at least.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Damn them…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re ten days late…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cheer up. Have a look around. I’ll start on a
fire…</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. campsite - day 129</strong>: Hector has scoured the
campsite. He holds up a canteen he has found.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s Sandy’s… whiskey…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well done, my lad!</p>
<p><strong>130 ext. camp - night 130</strong>: Hector and Bobby sit by
the fire with their supper. They are both anxious, but pretend not to
be.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Even if we lose their track, we’ll still hit
the river… we can’t miss that.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s too high for Indians?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Much too high. You won’t find an Indian up
here. We just have to keep our heads… no panic.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: If you did find an Indian, what would he
be?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You wouldn’t… but he might be a Delaware if
you did.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We keep working?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why not. We can log the peaks on the far
side, just a couple of sightings a day… keep us busy…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You think we’ll get out?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If we keep our heads. I wish I had some
tobacco.</p>
<p><strong>132 ext. camp - morning 132</strong>: In the morning Hector
and Bobby are taking readings from the instruments they have hung on a
large tree, main- taining the disciplines of their work. It gives some
shape and meaning to their predicament.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Barometer… twenty-eight and three-eighths…
temperature… low… thirty-four… high… forty-two and a half… time…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s getting worse… you’re nearly five
minutes fast now…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m not fast… you’re slowing down.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What’s the point of having two chronometers
when you don’t take the average?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Exactly… you should throw yours away.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’re unscientific, Bobby… at heart…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Seven twenty-five…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I see her in the dewy flowers I see her sweet
and fair…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: There’s not a bonny bird that sings But minds
me o’ my Jean…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Sure this is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>135 continued: 135</strong>: He indicates a slight change of
direction, and they move off again. Still they don’t talk. We can feel
their anxiety breeding in the silence. Why don’t they talk? They proceed
in this weighty silence, but even the CRIES of the BIRDS now seem to
mock them.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hi! Hello!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hey, come back… we’re just moving through…
don’t apologize… we all got a fright… goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>137 continued: 137</strong>: The Indian is in full retreat
now, waving his hands about apologetically, but making good distance
from them. Suddenly, he is gone. It has happened so quickly that Hector
and Bobby scarcely believe it has happened. Then they realize that in
their fright they have let go of the horse. It has headed back down to
the tastier pastures in the valley. They see it disappearing into the
trees below them.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That was stupid…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sure I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Was he a Delaware?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How the fuck should I know? He was an Indian…
and Indians don’t come in ones…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah… I think he was an Indian too… What
about the horse?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not going back down there.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Don’t panic, Bobby…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Same as you.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: An Indian… with long hair…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s it… kind of short…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah… he was’t tall…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Let’s get a bit further up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’ve you got in there?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Some food, the logbooks, my letters, a
candle…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: A gun?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We won’t have a fire tonight. We should make
a shelter though, in case it snows.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What about bears, without a fire?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t even think about bears, Hector.</p>
<p><strong>140 ext. camp - night 140</strong>: They are making a round
frame of bent branches and cover- ing it with foliage. Half-hidden in
the undergrowth, it is big enough for two men to huddle in. Tonight they
feel the most basic of urges, to curl up in a ball and hide.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe he’s lost too… on his own… must be
Delaware… they were chased up here years ago… everybody thought they’d
cleared off west… the other side of Ohio… they were an angry lot… no
wonder… they used to farm on the coast.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Go on, read it out…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What? No… not tonight…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ve had to listen to it every night since
April… why not now?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Dear, Father, I miss you. Three frogs are
dead. Everybody misses you. Bring me a bear’s head and claws and a gun.
School is good. Miss White has married a fireman. Come back soon. Do not
worry about the frogs, they did not have names. Nathaniel.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s not so funny now as it was.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It wasn’t funny then.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: If you knew him… if you could picture him
saying it… it would be funnier.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I had a father like you… nine months on a
whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed
us…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m going home, for the winter…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Smell it?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Goddam it… smell it?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Tobacco?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where the hell is it coming from?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t tell… a night like this it could
carry for miles…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I wish I had a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>141 continued: 141</strong>: After a tense silence, Hector
takes a small package from an inside pocket. He hands it to Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I was saving it… you have it…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you mean, you were saving it? You
know the rules… no hoarding, tobacco or food… you’ve listened to me for
a month, day and night… wanting a smoke…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well have it now… I don’t smoke… take
it…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’ve kept it from me, and you don’t even
use it…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I was saving it for my birthday… I was going
to give it to you then…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I have to wait until your birthday for a
smoke? Who are you… the fucking king?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Go on, smoke it… have it now…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I bloody won’t… I’m not smoking on your
command… I bloody won’t.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: God, your poor children… what do they have to
do for a piece of candy in your house? It’s very hard to like you
sometimes… d’you know that?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I know, Bobby… but that’s how I feel about
you, too… that’s why we’re friends… we try hard… come on… smoke your
pipe…</p>
<p><strong>141 continued: 141</strong>: Hector is neatly turning the
tables on Bobby, who now appears churlish, childish.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No… I’ll have it in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Come on… tell me… who would you rather be
sitting here with… have a think…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Daniel Boone?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah. He would be a help… but after Daniel
Boone…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t think of anyone else… but you’re
impossible to like sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We should sleep. We’ve got a lot of running
to do in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No we’re not… we’re going to talk… all
night…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: So… where do you want to start?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I know where you want to start…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Alicia…</p>
<p><strong>141 continued: 141</strong>: Bobby’s smile breaks into a
boyish laugh.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well… what about Alicia?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What do you mean, you’re sorry… I’m the one
that has to apologize…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh no you’re not…</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. forest - dawn 142</strong>: It is a glorious dawn.
Bobby sits looking out on the valley, smoking his pipe. Behind him
Hector is busy writing in his log book.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Isn’t it a beautiful day?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ve said who we are and where we’re headed.
Want to sign it, write anything?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: The peak we logged yesterday… I’ve named it
Nathanial Mountain. After my boy… is that fine with you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I was going to call it Tobacco Mountain… or
Mount Alicia… but Nathaniel’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>142 continued: 142</strong>: Hector smiles. He puts the paper
in a small leather pouch, puts the pouch on the ground near the shelter,
and starts to build a small pile of protective stones on top of it.
Bobby stands, and turns to watch him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let’s get away from here.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: North?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. Keep the sun on our backs.</p>
<p><strong>143 ext. forest - day 143</strong>: Hector and Bobby look
vulnerable as they walk through the open forest with their meager packs
on their backs.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We can move quicker without the horse… we
just have to keep moving… we have to get away from here.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Quiet. They’re on the other side…</p>
<p><strong>144 continued: 144</strong>: On the other side, they see the
women and children of a small group of Indians at the edge of a stream.
The women are washing clothes, the children are splashing and playing.
We are close enough to hear their laughter.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re right in the middle of them…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Does it have to be bad? They might be
friendly…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They were chased here… They should be on the
coast growing corn…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They’re behind us. They must think we’re
stalking the women…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Do you want to run?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ll do what you do.</p>
<p><strong>144 continued: 144</strong>: Hector and Bobby scatter the
women and children and splash across the stream, burning all their
energy in this mad life-or-death race. Although their families are safe,
the Indians keep up the chase, the moment of confusion compounded in
action. They lope easily after them, waiting for the white men to tire.
There are no whoops or shouts. They follow Hector and Bobby into the
trees, spreading out on either side, shaping the human net that will
soon engulf them. It is a menacing spectacle. Death is near. Hector and
Bobby stay close together as they run.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: When they catch up… fight… it’ll be quicker…
fight like hell…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: They’re not going to catch us. We’re going
home.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hold my hand, Bobby…</p>
<p><strong>145 ext. building - day 145</strong>: A war party of media
people surround Hector as he exits a Yellow Cab. He forces his way
through the yelling crowd of REPORTERS and camera crews. Hector is
trying to make his way into a crumbling apartment building in Queens.
Policemen help Hector through the barrage of shouted questions.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Do you know the lady, Mr. Troup?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Think you’ll go to jail again?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Look here for a second, will you,
Mr. Troup?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Will you talk to us when you come
out?</p>
<p><strong>145 continued: 145</strong>: Hector enters the building. The
media mob immediately switch off their energy. They light cigarettes,
fiddle with cameras, stare into space, as if someone has shouted
“Cut.”</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You guys are downstairs… third floor…
thirty-eight…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You’re forty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: This is Troup!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Come here, Troup. I’m Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You bring everything?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Building warrant, license, fire
certificate, sanitation certificate… I want them all… This is
Mr. Santiago, from the city… insurance…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: This isn’t really my building… it’s my
partner’s… I just took the call and came right over… I have to leave
town in an hour or so anyway…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Slow down, Troup… so it’s 3:15 on a
Friday… you’re staying here ’til Mr. Santiago gets the paperwork… get
your partner over here, with everything… this is serious…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: 3:35…</p>
<p><strong>mr. santiago</strong>: I might have to close the place
down.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mr. philippopolis</strong>: I phoned you Monday… I told you
the floor was making noises…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Not me, Mrs. Philippopolis… my ex-partner… I
think you spoke to him… How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Come back from there, Troup, the floor’s
still moving…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ll make a couple of calls… I’ll straighten
it out… is she bad? Why don’t they move her?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: They waited for a portable X-Ray machine…
they can move her now.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: She seems in good spirits…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. philippopolis</strong>: Wait ’til my son sees his mother
lying here like this… he’s gonna sue you… you’re a lousy landlord… you
should be ashamed… to let old people live like this… I phoned you
Monday… I have a witness! I was dancing with a prince on my eighteenth
birthday, and now look at me… you have me falling down a toilet!</p>
<p><strong>148 int. building - day 148</strong>: Hector retreats into
the hallway. Takes out his mobile phone and dials, while watching the
ominous Mr. Santiago making copius notes in his book. Hector gets
connected.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Boris… why did you do this to me? Get down
here now… they want all kinds of certificates… They won’t let me leave
the building… I have my kids tonight, I haven’t seen them in four years…
I did tell you, I’ve been talking about it all week… how come they
phoned me, this isn’t my building? What? Don’t tell me anymore… I want
you here, now… and on your knee… I’ll phone the lawyer… but you move. My
weekend’s ruined before it’s started.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Anna… thank God… you have to help me… I’m
still in Queens… I’ve got cops here and everything … I need your car… I
don’t have time to pick up the rental now… they won’t let me leave the
building… you come down here… and put my bag in the car… no.. I have to
pick the kids up by six, otherwise I fuck up her weekend too… she’ll
kill me… this is an emergency… what can I say? Please… right… okay…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: It looks like water rotted the floor… You
have any plumbing maintenance records?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: At the office… I might have some bills… it’s
not my building.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: It’s a weird one… I don’t know how water
could sit in there for so long without somebody noticing … you didn’t
use water-resistent paint on the ceilings did you?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t really know…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: You’re going to have to check out the
whole building… you know that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Can I do it Monday?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Good joke… it’ll take you a month.</p>
<p><strong>148 continued: 148</strong>: Hector is already dialing
another number as Santiago wanders off in search of further fascinating
discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Can I speak with Leonard, please…
Mr. Deutsch? My name is Hector Troup, Borlonski and Troup, Real
Estate…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Leonard… it’s Hector… Borlonski and Troup…
yes… listen, we’ve had a domestic accident at our Eighth Street
building… a floor … and an old lady… she did mention the word sue, but
it might have been hysterics… what I need to know is what certificates
you have on file for the building… I know it’s Friday… just do one
thing… let me know if the insurance is current… I need to know that… I’m
on my mobile… anything you have… before five … thank you…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. philippopolis</strong>: My son’s downstairs… when he
sees me like this he’ll kill you… go on… jump through the hole… see what
it feels like! Break both legs!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ll be on the way in thirty minutes at the
outside… I can’t say… Queens to New Jersey, on a Friday… what do you
think? I’ll be there… it’s important to me too, I’ve been trying to put
this weekend together for years… I’ll be there… I won’t take it out on
the kids, I can walk away from problems… as soon as I get the car… I’ll
be there…</p>
<p><strong>150 ext. building - day 150</strong>: On a street Hector
stands with a Policeman watching Mrs. Philippopolis being loaded into
the ambulance. Her SON is with her. When she is safely inside he walks
towards Hector. Fortunately he is of modest build, and a head shorter
than Hector, and he seems to be saving his wrath for the Courthouse.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Mr. Troup, I’m George Philippopolis.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m sorry about your mother…</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Well… it’s happened… you want to travel with
us, or do you have a car?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: To the hospital…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well, I wasn’t planning to…</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: You’re not making a visit to the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ve talked to your mother, given her my
best wishes… she wants her family with her now… Any other Friday but
this one.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: He’s not coming to the hospital…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: That could look bad…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Look, George… here’s what I can do… I’ll
visit her on Tuesday, I’ll organize some flowers… lots…</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Screw the flowers… who’s gonna check her into
the hospital… who’s gonna pay? It’s your building that fell down…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: They won’t let me leave here…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Wait ’til they hear this in court … he wouldn’t
even make a trip to the hospital… Can’t you even give me a credit card
number?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s never been this bad, Boris. Deutsch is
checking the insurance… did you bring the rest?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Yeah… we’re covered for most things… the
license is current, the inspection certificate is okay…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What’s with the we… it’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: She’s a witch… her bones must be made of
steel… she didn’t break a thing… it might help if you make a visit to
the hospital… why did you do this to me?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: I’m sorry, Hector… I just put your name on
the lousy forms… I didn’t plan this… I just borrowed your name on the
titles.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I told you to stop doing that… why does this
keep happening to me… my name is mine… use your own name, Boris
Borlonski… will you remember that? Boris Borlonski!</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Hector… forgive me… I’ll take care of it…
don’t let it spoil your weekend… four years, huh? You make the most of
it… and don’t worry, you’ll walk away from this… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah, I’m sorry too… you have to get out of
this business… I thought I had…</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Go on… have a great weekend… I’ll talk to you
on Monday… we’ll straighten everything out…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: This is the worst it’s been.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Everything can be fixed… always.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Get in… you can dropp me at the shop.</p>
<p><strong>152 int. car - day 152</strong>: Anna drives skilfully
through the busy Friday streets.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You bring my bag?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeah. Your camera’s in there too. Take some
photographs of the kids…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Sure. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Not much… just like I’m being executed…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well you deserve to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Don’t worry… this is the beginning of
something… not the end… you can start being a father again.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m glad you talked me into it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I didn’t do much… you were ready…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’re right… you’re absolutely right… I was
ready… I am ready, for everything… I’m fixing all that shit with Boris…
I told him… it can’t go on… I want my freedom.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: … and the kids… that’ll work out… we can
have them over sometimes… Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sure… that was the plan… when we have the
space…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Right, when we have the space… when we get
the bigger apartment… together…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: There you go… you said it… the bigger
apartment together…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah… I said it, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re a man of decision, Hector…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes I am… Together… I said it … and get out
of my car at the corner here… I don’t have the time to go ’round the
block.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Thanks… for the car… everything…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do the best you can with them, Hector… and one
more thing… deliver these…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What? Anna, I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Here’s the address… just two blocks before the
bridge… a five minute detour. It’s a golden wedding… you have to…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We have to help each other…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh, you’ll need gas too… Go to it, Hector…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Phone if there’s any disasters… don’t suffer
alone…</p>
<p><strong>153 int./ext. car - day 153</strong>: A trip from Queens to
New Jersey at five o’clock on a Friday afternoon is going to look like a
dream sequence whatever you do with it, and that’s fine. Hector’s trip
to his children has more meaning for us than a simple journey from A to
B. We will be aware of our other Hectors, and the journeys home that
they did or didn’t manage to make. This car trip will pull the threads
together. And after so many images of the natural world, a world little
altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in all its mad glory
will place our Hector in a new dimen- sion. If there is a breathtaking
moment in this film, when everything comes together, when all the pieces
fit, then it will be somewhere around here that it happens. Six thousand
years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching for his family. If the
traffic allows, tonight in New Jersey Hector will complete his journey.
We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the avenues of Manhattan
and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hello… Leonard, hello… yes… we’re insured…
thank God… yes now I know God’s a lawyer… thanks…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Hi, Hector.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You made it. The kids are just coming.
They’re not over the moon about going to the beach house. I ought to
warn you.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Why didn’t you say? I could have fixed up
something else. I thought it would be a good place to get to know them
again…</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Well, I figured you should be allowed to make
your own mistakes. It’s only for a couple of nights, they can take it…
and you’ll learn… Check into a hotel if it gets too much… they like
hotels.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Come on, you two… your father’s ready to
go…</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: This is where we’ll be, if anything crops up…
thanks for the break…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Maybe this is a bit sudden for them… Maybe I
should have come over a couple of nights and got to know them…</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: By Monday, you’ll know them…</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Here he is, the invisible dad.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: That’s what they call you.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You three have a good weekend. If it’s too
miserable at the house your father said he’ll take you to a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Good luck, Hector.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: See you Monday, Hector.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Are those for mom?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Oh no… Jesus save me… what have I done…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No… I can’t face it, not just now…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>155 int./ext. car - dusk 155</strong>: They are driving on
the freeway. It is dusk. Hector is on the telephone again. He can’t let
go of business.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Excuse me, kids… I have to consult the
oracle…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hello… God? No, Leonard, it’s Hector… just a
joke… sorry to phone you at home, did Boris call you? The insurance is
fine? Good … but she could claim negligence … oh, she’s got a lawyer
already? That’s a bad omen…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Is there anything we can do right now… make
her an offer… Sure, with the insurance company… sure… you’re right… me,
too… I have the kids in the car with me right now… sorry to bother you…
’bye…</p>
<p><strong>155 continued: 155</strong>: Hector throws the phone onto the
passenger seat, lets out a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the
mirror. Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than they
are, and vulnerable. Hector’s heart aches for them. He smiles and puts
on an act of brightness.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: That’s it! The last call… the weekend starts
right now… we have things to do… look out for a Safeway… we need some
supplies… and gas… oh my God, gas… soon…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Want to make any calls? Betsy?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No… and it’s Thomas…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: But we called you Tom… that’s what it says
on your birth certificate…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I changed it.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Right… it’s your name… you can do that…
Safeway… keep your eyes skinned… and I could murder a Chicken
McNugget.</p>
<p><strong>156 continued: 156</strong>: For every four items Hector puts
in his cart Betsy removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector
notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy returns the
rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he makes a stand. He turns to
face her.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What’s wrong with that? It’s a kitchen roll…
why can’t I pick a kitchen roll?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It’s bleached… and it isn’t recycled… you
don’t care… you just buy junk…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Good point, Betsy…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Everything you buy is junk… I don’t eat
steak… and what’s this…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Ugh! Why don’t you ask us what we like… it’ll
save you money… you buy junk, we won’t eat it…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well, get to it… I’ll just tag along…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I do it every week anyway.</p>
<p><strong>156 continued: 156</strong>: Thomas backs her up.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: She does. She tells us what to eat. We let
her.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Can I just keep a couple of those steaks? We
can’t live on chicken.</p>
<p><strong>158 int./ext. car - night 158</strong>: Back on the road, it
is later. The kids have fallen asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them
in their sleep, searching for some traces of the little children that
have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots he abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Are you going to bring the flowers in?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Don’t mention the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>160 int. house - night 160</strong>: Later, Hector can’t
sleep. It has been too eventful a day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a
late-night TV SHOW. A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is
talking to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones which he
regularly scatters on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>tv man</strong>: This is good, Tony, the stones are talking
to me already… now here’s something… travel… movement… Tony, are you
planning a move… travel… anything?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes I am… I’ve been thinking about a move to
California…</p>
<p><strong>tv man</strong>: The big one, eh, Tony? These stones are
really talking here… what are you planning for yourself in
California?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m hoping for an acting career, Mel…</p>
<p><strong>tv man</strong>: Tony, these stones really like what you’re
planning… there is no doubt in my mind about that… now listen… you have
to be specific… these stones really want to tell you something, be it
love, money or the purpose of your life… but I want a specific question
from you… think about it… what do you want to know… love… or your income
level next year? Be as specific as you can, Tony…</p>
<p><strong>161 int. house - night 161</strong>: Next door, he watches
the kids sleeping in their little holiday beds. Hector watches them.
We’ve seen our Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as he
turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright.</p>
<p><strong>161 continued: 161</strong>: Betsy starts talking loudly. At
first Hector thinks she is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is
fast asleep.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Get me the books… all the books… all of the
books… no, no, no… not the pancakes… not the pancakes… no…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: … not the pancakes…</p>
<p><strong>tv woman</strong>: … find your true cosmic partner first time
around… every weekday morning at three here on the Psychic Network…
Lucinda’s Horoscope Dating Show… remember there is an answer, and there
is a special partner out there for you…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: … don’t let the oil run out… yes you did…
watch the oil… why… why?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How about some eggs?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You don’t eat eggs?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: How many have you got in there?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Three. Is that all right?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: For a week, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How about pancakes, Betsy… d’you like
pancakes?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Not much… why?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I just wondered. Pancakes don’t mean much to
you?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: They don’t mean a thing. Why?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I thought we could walk into town this
morning. I saw the Funfair when we came through last night.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: We don’t go to Funfairs.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Let’s take the walk anyway.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I brought some books. I want to stay home
and read.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No. We’re taking a walk.</p>
<p><strong>163 int. hallway - day 163</strong>: They are preparing to
leave the house. Thomas is still reluctant to go.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: It’s going to rain… we should stay.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Here’s an umbrella… and there must be some
old coats in here… and shoes… I only have these I’m wearing…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Donald has some shoes…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t know if I want to wear Donald’s
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Wow. Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Six years ago. Look at that… What’s
this?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: That was the flood. The sea came right up.
Donald says it’s the icecap melting. It’s going to get worse. That’s why
Mom’s selling the place.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It comes up every year?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: The last two.</p>
<p><strong>164 ext. beach - day 164</strong>: They are on the beach,
walking in the direction of town. Hector strides ahead in a show of
enthusiasm, although awkward in Donald’s big shoes. The kids trail
behind. He calls back to them.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Where are the birds? Is it the wrong time of
year?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: They don’t come over so much. The shellfish
have gone… that’s what…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: That’s what Donald says?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes… and it happens to be true.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Please don’t rain… please…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Let’s have a ride…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: The seats are wet.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Kitchen roll, unbleached, re-cycled,
biodegradable… dry seats…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: This is ridiculous. Let’s go somewhere and
talk.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: All right, if you want to…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How do we land these things?</p>
<p><strong>166 int. coffee shop - day 166</strong>: The only place the
small town has to offer is a deserted coffee shop on the shorefront.
Hector, Betsy and Thomas sit at a corner table, beyond them through the
window is the beach and the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Sure you won’t have a pancake, Betsy?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Okay, first question?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What he means is why did you stay away?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well, that’s a fair question… your mother
and I got divorced… you’re big enough to remember… she must have told
you all that?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Sure she has… but lots of people get
divorced… that doesn’t mean they disappear…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’re right… what can I tell you… I went
kind of crazy after that, for a good while… I came around a few times…
remember?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well, it wasn’t easy… everything with her
and Donald happened pretty quickly. I missed you both really badly… but
for a while I thought I should stay away, until your mother got settled…
no, that’s not really true… I missed you… but I was kind of crazy at the
same time… your mother and I married young… I wasn’t used to the
freedom… it went to my head … then you moved to New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It’s forty minutes away on a slow bus…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’re right, you’re right. I don’t have too
many excuses for the first year… the second year is easier… I was in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: We were doing government work, big
contracts… there were some temptations… my boss asked me to shuffle a
few papers… there was a lot of money in it… I had to testify against
him… it was like killing somebody.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but Mom
wouldn’t let him.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well I appreciate that… but I’m glad your
mother didn’t let you. I’ll tell you all about it some day. It was no
fun. One year and eight months.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: We didn’t even know when you got out.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I wasn’t in great shape… I sure didn’t want
you to see me then… so I got back to work… in real estate… found a
partner, we met in jail…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No. He’s a good man, a good man. I like him.
I mean it. He’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s what you do now?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yes. We rent apartments… but we want to get
into commercial property… people are a nuisance… does that sound
bad?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Just recently I’ve been feeling good, things
have been going well… and I missed you two… so here we are…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What about your girl friend?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Who told you about her?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Anna… she’s nice… she wants to meet you,
real soon… she sells flowers… well, you know that… and on Monday she’s
probably going to kill me…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Betsy thinks that was her at the gas
station…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Shut up, Tom…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No… heck… no… did you think she was
following us?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: She’s always thinking up stories like that…
she never stops…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Well, if people don’t tell you things…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: She’s right, Thomas… people should talk
more.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: So you haven’t been staying away because of
us?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What do you mean? Is that what you thought?
I was avoiding you two? No… you mustn’t think that… that’s terrible…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: The rain’s off. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>167 ext. beach - day 167</strong>: Betsy and Hector are
sitting on the sea wall, watching Thomas play on the beach. The sun is
emerging.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I have to ask you something else.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why did you leave just two days before my
swimming test?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I didn’t leave because it was two days
before your test… it was just what your mother and I decided… I taught
you how to swim… we went to the pool twice a week… why would I
leave?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I know… that’s what I mean… why did you leave
just then?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Oh, God, Betsy. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: How did you do, in the test?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I passed.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m a life-saver now.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hey, Thomas! We’re going home… we’re having
a barbecue… Betsy said she’ll even let me eat a steak!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Hurry up, Tom!</p>
<p><strong>167 continued: 167</strong>: Thomas breaks off from his play
and runs towards them.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Don’t call him Tom, he doesn’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m allowed.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Your mother said it, when we split up… don’t
lose the children… didn’t mean much at the time. But she was right.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Who said I’d let you eat a steak?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Betsy. On Monday will you come with me when
I take the flowers back to Anna? I can’t face her alone. She wants to
meet you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You’ll be there, right beside me?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’d have to take the morning off school.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Is that bad?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, that could be good…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Just tell them you were with your invisible
dad.</p>
<p><strong>168 ext. beach - day 168</strong>: Hector and Betsy are
walking on the shore. Thomas tags along behind them.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What’s she like? How did you meet her?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: The funny thing is I fell in love with her
before I ever saw her… I smelled her… It was the day I got out of jail…
I was on the train and she was sitting behind me… it was just this
incredible perfume… remember I’d been inside for nearly two years with
four hundred sweating males… She got off the train and I followed her… I
couldn’t help it… that’s how good she is… she listened to a bum who
followed her off a train…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: … but she’s still going to kill me on
Monday…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I think I’ll paint the sunset tonight.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: It’s just like a big pancake up there, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I remember when you two were tiny.. I used
to watch you sleeping… it was like now… I felt close to you, could touch
you… but you weren’t there… you were gone… dreamland … just when I was
closest to you, you weren’t there… I felt it last night, too.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s what it’s like… you should know
that.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’m not smart about things like that,
usually.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t be so tough on yourself. You seem to
want to be… you don’t have to…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No… we can do that…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Is that a joke?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, I mean it… look out for yourself…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Who are you? Who’s inside there?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>169 ext. boat - day 169</strong>: Betsy and Thomas are in a
small fragile rowboat, some distance from the shore. They are watching
Hector who is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach. Another
Hector and another pile of stones. This one is making a fire for the
barbecue. These human rituals never stop.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I thought he was taller.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Well, it’s been a while… you’re bigger.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I suppose so. He’s getting fat, too. I bet I
could beat him at the breast-stroke now.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Come on in, kids… that boat doesn’t look too
safe…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: We’re fine!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’ve just found you… I don’t want to lose
you. What would I tell your mother… come on in…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Throw me the rope, Thomas, I’ll pull you
in.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: This is one useless piece of rope,
Thomas…</p>
<p><strong>171 ext. beach - sunset 171</strong>: At the very moment of
sunset Betsy is trying to capture it in a watercolor sketch. She has set
up an easel on the beach. It’s like action painting. She works
frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips into the ocean.
Tough little Betsy can even lose patience with the sun.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why does it always go so fast…?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I used to know how to do this…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I did… I used to be really good at this…</p>
<p><strong>172 ext. beach - dusk 172</strong>: It is a calm dusk. Hector
is turning the meat on the barbecue. He is in a splendid frame of
mind.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Ah… smell it… the smell of civilization…
scorched meat…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’d forgotten that… how you eat… dedicated…
like it’s your religion!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Things I like.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: You used to hum to yourself too, when you
ate… like everything was fine with the world.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hey, so I did… I’d forgotten about that…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: There she is… old Mercury…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: No… Mercury doesn’t rise ’til after
midnight… that’s Jupiter…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I’d forgotten… we used to watch the stars…
you could tell me the names of all the planets… you could recite them
like a poem… remember… at the tiny window upstairs in the old house?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Oh well, not to worry. I’m glad you still
like astronomy though.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’m not into star-gazing so much … we’re
working on computer modelling… we’re trying to make a biosphere…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Uh-huh?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: A self-sustaining life system… for
inter-stellar travel. But we always get a methane build up, it doesn’t
matter what we do…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: This is at school?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yeah. We’re making such a mess of the world,
one day we’re going to have to take off for somewhere else…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Sounds like Donald said that…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Well, I’m glad you two are thinking about
the old planet. I’m proud of you. Look how beautiful everything is.
Sometimes I think it’s people that make it all wrong… we walk around
with all our problems…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t know. If it wasn’t for us there’d be
nobody around to see it all.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Don’t worry, you two… I’ll tell you… it’s
just a big, black sheet up there with holes in it so the light comes
through… that’s the truth… the very latest…</p>
<p><strong>172 continued: 172</strong>: Their voices ring out playfully
across the expanse of darkening beach and light-laden sky.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Wait a minute… I know… the whole universe is
inside a speck of dust that’s lying in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a
pair of pants hanging over the back of a chair…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: No… I’ll tell you… the whole thing… stars
and everything… is sitting on the skin of a bubble of milk in a bowl of
cornflakes… and somebody’s just about to eat it…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Skimmed milk…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You don’t get bubbles in skimmed milk…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Okay… it’s half-and-half…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’ve got a better one… we’re all inside a
speck of pollen that’s stuck to the wing of a bee while it sits on a
flower…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Don’t mention flowers, Betsy… please, not
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I have an idea, Betsy… we’re inside a
pancake… what d’you think?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why are you always talking about pancakes…
what’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You’ve got pancakes on the brain.</p>
