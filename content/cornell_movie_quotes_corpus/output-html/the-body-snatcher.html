<p><strong>rko radio pictures</strong>: presents</B></p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Here, – here’s a bit of something for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macbride</strong>: He’ll not leave the grave – not since
Wednesday last when we buried the lad.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Your son, ma’am? He must have been a fine
boy for the wee dog to love him so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macbride</strong>: A great, kind lad, he was – gentle
with all things like Robbie.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Not much danger here, ma’am, I wouldn’t
think – right here in the heart of Edinburgh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macbride</strong>: They’re uncommon bold, the grave
robbers – and the daft doctors who drive them on.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’m by way of being a medical myself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macbride</strong>: A doctor?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: A student. I’m studying under Dr. MacFarlane
– that is, I’ve been studying until today –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’ll get it, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I can’t run and play.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’d forgotten that, lassie. All the more
reason for Friend here bidding you a good-day.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Would you mind carrying her up the
steps?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Back in your own wee cab.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Thank ye, ma’am. Thank ye. You watch sharp,
little miss for my horse to give you a “hello”.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: I would like to see Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Maximillian – a very famous colleague of
mine. I’m delighted to honor his request.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: No. It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Was the paralysis immediate?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: No, Doctor. She seemed to get better,
then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back
–</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: How long after that was the paralysis
complete?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Nearly a year.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Any attacks of pain since?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Is her pain sporadic or constant?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: It comes at intervals. They used to be
months apart – but they’ve been growing more frequent – much more
frequent.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: See here, child, when you have this pain
in your back, where is it?</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Point to where it hurts. You can at
least do that, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: This is useless, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Please, darling, don’t be so
stubborn.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Mother – he frightens me.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Come in, boy – come in.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you
–</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Come – it’s a chance to try out your
bedside manner, Fettes. Take a look at the child.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Are you a doctor, too?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: You’ll be a good doctor. I know all about
doctors.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: That’s a nice chair you have.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: What you really want to ask me is about my
back, isn’t it – about where it hurts?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Why, yes.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Would you mind very much if I lifted you – –
onto that table in there?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Child seems to take to the lad. What
sort of an accident was it, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: A carriage overturned. My husband was
killed and Georgina was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: How long ago?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Three years.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Meg, give Fettes a hand there – help him
wheel the little girl into the hall.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: But can anything be done for her?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Perhaps – a delicate operation – an
operation which has never been performed – but it could be performed.
I’m sure it could be – I could incise the columna dorsi –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: And you will try – you will operate?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Not I, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: But, Doctor, in Leyden – in Paris -
wherever I’ve taken Georgina – they’ve mentioned your name. I’ve come to
think of you as our only hope.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Believe me, Madame, if I were only a
doctor, I would undertake this operation at once. But I’m more dominie
than doctor – I’ve a school to run.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: But, Doctor, surely in a case like this
– a child – a little child who can never walk or run –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I regret it, Ma’am, but I have the
responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand
children like your own.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: There’s nothing I can say for one small
child?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’m not heartless, Ma’am. I have every
sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to
every operation brought to me, I’d have no time for teaching – and
that’s a great responsibility upon me, Ma’am – a great
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’m afraid I’ll have to give up medicine,
Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You’re made for a doctor, young man!</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’m afraid I have to, sir. You see, my
father is vicar at Thrums – it’s a small parish – not much of a living
–</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You’re too good a man, Fettes – I’ll not
let you quit. I’ll make an assistant of you – that’ll pay your keep and
your tuition, too –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I thought only the best students were made
assistants.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Well? And are you not a good
student?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But Richardson?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Richardson is a fine student. He’s got a
glib tongue, but you’ll be a better doctor, Fettes. Come along now –</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: A word with you, Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: And why not? He’s a good lad – bright
and able.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Aye. He’s a good lad. That’s why I ask you,
MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You think it’ll spoil the boy, eh? Was I
not assistant to Knox?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Aye –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: – all my gratitude, sir – I can never
express it…</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: They’ll be satisfaction enough for me to
know I’ve trained the great Dr. Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Yes, Doctor – yes.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: – otherwise I might get the idea you are
trying to spy on me.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You know how we get the specimens we use
for dissection?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: From the Municipal Council – they’re the
bodies of paupers –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: That’s what the law stipulates but there
are not enough of them, Fettes – there are not enough of them –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Here – give me a hand – this is heavy.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’m Donald Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’m very pleased to know you, Master
Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Mr. Gray?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: That’s right. Gray, the cabman. I’ve had a bit
of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Of course – it’s the soul of the business –
the pay –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Good night, Mr. Gray.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: My respects, Master Fettes, and may this be
the first of many profitable meetings.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Well, well, my boy. Your first meeting
with the redoubtable Gray. You may count it as a milestone in your
medical career.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: My medical career –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: All right, gentleman – that will do! Settle
down!</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Mr. Fettes –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: What lady, Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Why do you come here? The Doctor said he
wouldn’t operate.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: I’ve already told you I didn’t come to
see Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Then whom do you wish to see in MacFarlane’s
own house?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: You asked to see me, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: I want you to help my little girl.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’m only a student.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Georgina told me how kind you were to
her. It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I don’t know that I can do that,
Mrs. Marsh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Did he tell you about Georgina?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I didn’t mean it that way. I meant only that
I am not in a position to ask favors.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Ask this one favor –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Of course I will.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Georgina was right. You are a kind
man.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: In an adult this muscle can apply more
than one hundred seventy-five pounds of pressure? Double that and you
get the full strength of the human jaw. That, gentlemen, is to chew our
food and bite our enemies.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Yes, sir. This fellow must have been a
great one at hurling the bar – beautiful biceps. Burke and Hare would
never have got the best of this fellow.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: I was making a joke, sir.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: It’s a poor subject for jest, Richardson
– particularly for a medical student.</p>
<p><strong>gilchrist</strong>: What did you say to His Imperial
Highness?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Nothing but a merry word about Burke and
Hare –</p>
<p><strong>gilchrist</strong>: That’s nothing for him to get upset
about. They’re dead and buried –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macbride</strong>: They killed his wee doggie too –
little Robbie.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I don’t think I can go on, sir.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What the devil do you mean? You have
your lodgings, a certain stipend – I thought I had arranged everything
for you –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I saw the woman whose son’s body was
delivered last night.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: And that’s why you don’t want to be a
doctor, Fettes?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Not if I have to be party to things like
that, Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Fettes, I was an assistant once. I had
to deal with men like Gray. Do you think I did it because I wanted to?
Do you think I want to do it now? But I must and you must.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But this woman – and her son –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’m sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her
son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to
work on more human specimens. As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me
when I know I’m right – when I know that I need those lifeless subjects
for my student’s enlightenment and for my own knowledge. And if you’re a
real man and want to be a good doctor, you’ll see it as I see it.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: We’ll have a stiffener or two of hot rum
and by then we will be able to meet this fellow on fairly equal terms of
warmth, eh Fettes?</p>
<p><strong>gray’s voice</strong>: A fine “specimen” isn’t he, Toddy
MacFarlane?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Come, Toddy – come. Sit down here with me.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Don’t call me that confounded name.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane – although I’ve
known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name. Aye, and many are dead now
who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too. But come
Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Mr. Fettes and I have professional
matters to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Medicine? That’ll keep. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: We’ll buy you a glass, Gray.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’m a pretty bad fellow myself, but MacFarlane
is the boy – Toddy MacFarlane –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: No, on second thought, let me order. We’ll
have a bowl of hot punch and a cut off the loin from that fine
porker.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I will not have you use that name to
me.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You will not have it?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane – you remember the lady who
came to see you yesterday – the lady with the little girl?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I remember her.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: She came again today. She wanted me to ask
you if you would not break your rule and operate. She feels you are her
only hope.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: So she told me. I’m a teacher – not a
practitioner.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You’re a teacher, eh? Maybe you’re afraid to
be a doctor, Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Afraid of what?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as
you make out to be.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I am the best man for the job.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Why don’t you do it then?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You? Why? Since when have you become the
protector of little children?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’m not concerned about the child, Toddy. It’s
you I’m thinking of, I’d like to see you prove that a lot of things I
know haven’t hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’ll not do it, Gray.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Oh, yes, you will. You’ll do it to oblige
Fettes and myself.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Maybe there’s some private reason between you
and me which will make you – some long lost friend of ours. Say that
you’ll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: It might be an interesting case.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: That’s a good boy, Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You only want me to do it because I
don’t want to. That’s it, isn’t it, Gray?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Toddy hates me.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Don’t call me that confounded name, I
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Hear him? Did you ever see the lads play
knife?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: We medicals have a better way than that.
When we dislike a friend we dissect him.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You’ll never get rid of me that way, Toddy.
You and I have two bodies – aye, very different sorts of bodies – but
we’re closer than if we were in the same skin – for I saved that skin of
yours once and you’ll not forget it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: You have his promise, then?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: – pain – and shock. She’s brave enough,
but I don’t know about myself. Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I
dare trust my child into any but God’s hands. Maybe He knows best.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Ma’am, is you’ll allow me, I’d like to give
you cause for courage – Dr. MacFarlane is a great man – I think he’s the
greatest man in medicine. God would not have given him such gifts if
they were not meant for Georgina’s cure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Mommie! Mommie!</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Hear him?</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: The white horse. The horse that is going
to greet me when he sees me.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: An old acquaintance, eh?</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: It was a brown horse.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: A cabby told her his horse would say
“hello” to her the next time he saw her. Georgina has been looking
everywhere for that horse.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Why do you want the white horse to bid you
“good-day”?</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: He was a nice horse.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Maybe there’s another reason. Maybe you
haven’t friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Of course – I don’t have friends. That’s
because I can’t walk. I try to make myself used to it.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: One shouldn’t get used to the wrong things,
Georgina. You want to walk and run and play.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Really, Mr. Fettes – I thought you at
least would know how much Georgina wants that.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Aye, but I still wonder how much.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I want it –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But you’ll have to stand great pain,
Georgina. Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of
your sickness. Do you want it that much?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Gray’s head – is that it, Teddy? Is that what
broke just now under the poker. Broken it – and have done with him
forever.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You’re daft. What’s Gray to me. He’s
only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it – the rest is
forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you’ll not
rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Nonsense. You’re a fey creature with mad
ideas. But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No great lady will ever take my place?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: It was about last night I wanted to talk to
you – about the operation on the little Marsh girl.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You’re a man of the world, Fettes, you
wouldn’t hold me to promise given in drink.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But I – well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh
and told her.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Really, Fettes, you irk me with your
lack of understanding.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But you did promise.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Look here, Fettes. Not I nor anyone else
knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure
success in such an operation. I would have to study the matter. Have we
any “subjects”?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Wilmont used up the last spinal section.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You see, it is completely out of the
question.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Yes, I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Now you run off and see that pretty
Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Joseph –</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I’d gladly run with a message, sir, for a
florin. It’s not much, considering it’s Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I only want his address.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: He lives in the Westport –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Do you know where Mr. Gray lives – Gray, the
cabman?</p>
<p><strong>gray’s voice</strong>: Come in – come in.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: So it’s the young doctor come to see me. I’m
honored – honored –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane didn’t send me. I came of my
own accord.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: It would be difficult – very difficult. There
was a dog that bothered me during the last job – people seem so
concerned about dogs – all in all it raised the very mother and father
of a row. I’m told the kirkyards are to be guarded. But I would not like
to say that it would be impossible to get a “subject”.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But how soon, man? Dr. MacFarlane is engaged
in some very urgent research at present. He can’t wait very long.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I fear he may have to.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But can’t you give me any idea?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: How could I? I will do my best. After all, you
see, I am financially interested.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: If that’s your answer – it’ll have to
do.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Ah, Friend! There’s bad news for you, boy –
bad news –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: There, Master Fettes. Sooner than we had
expected. A stoke of luck one might say.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You are entirely mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Well, well, good morning to you, young
Master Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane, have you ever seen a street
singer who sang “The Twa Corby”?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Every street singer with a cracked voice
gives tongue to that one.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: This girl was beautiful – a wild lassie from
the Highlands.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Beautiful, you say? It’s a wonder I have
not remarked her.</p>
<p><strong>fettes’ voice</strong>: She was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I went to see Gray last night. I asked him
to bring us a specimen. On my way I saw this girl. I gave her alms
money. She was alive and singing.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Gray killed her.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: We can’t be sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I am sure. I mean to report it. It’s like
Burke and Hare all over again.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I wouldn’t do that, Fettes. I wouldn’t
report it.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Grave robbing is one thing – this is
murder.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I don’t know that – neither do you. This
subject may have been an epileptic – thrown a fit – fallen out of bed –
cracked her skull and killed herself – there is everything explained –
the bruise on her head –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I can’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Believe it or not. It’s best for you to
pretend that you do. After all, it was you who ordered this specimen,
received it here, and paid for it. That makes you a party to murder.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But, I didn’t ask him to kill.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Who would believe that? And you know,
someone else might recognize her. She was as well known as the Castle
Rock.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Have a drop – it’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: I couldn’t swallow it.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Only twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Only twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Here is where you must watch closely,
gentleman – closely – it is the very heart of the matter –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Wait, Doctor – wait! The child’s
fainting.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Give her some brandy if you want.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: She’s unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Pulse?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Slow – but not too alarming.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Let us proceed.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’ll be finished with her in an instant.
Then you can consider her your patient, Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Doctor –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What the devil is the matter with you –
forever creeping about. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Mr. Gray –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I don’t wish to see Mr. Gray.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Now that wasn’t a friendly thing I heard,
Toddy. Not at all friendly.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: That has nothing to do with it. We’ve
decided to do more lecturing and less dissection – it’s better for the
students – that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You know what you want and don’t want – so
that’s an end of business between us – but we’ll still be friends,
Toddy. I’ll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while – for auld
lang syne, you know.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I suppose we can’t prevent that, Gray –
– for auld lang syne.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: And do you think you’re getting rid of me,
Toddy?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I would like to speak to you.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I presume you shall. This won’t be my last
visit here.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I want to speak to you alone. I saw
something. I heard.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I know –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Oh, you’ll have ample opportunity – ample –
Good morning, Dr. Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I just saw Gray. What was he laughing
at?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps
his horse tickled him in the ribs.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’ve just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina
is doing splendidly. The incision has healed – clean and fine – but she
doesn’t seem to have any desire to walk.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: When she’s ready you bring her to me –
I’ll show her how.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what
happiness you’ve brought those people.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: That’s only our duty, Fettes – that’s
the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I suppose one must pass through this
purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: That’s the way of it, Fettes. You bring
the lassie to me.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Don’t you want to find the white horse,
Georgina? You can’t find him from a wheelchair. You have to walk and run
to find him.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You can’t – can’t! Stop trying to bribe
her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk –
her spine’s all right. I know it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But she must want to stand. She must want to
walk.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Confound me, the child’s a cripple, of
course she wants to walk. Child, I say to you get up out of that chair
and walk.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I can’t! I can’t! My legs won’t move.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: I’m sorry, Doctor. Georgina’s a good
child – a brave child – you saw how she was during the operation – but
if she can’t move, she can’t move.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: But she must be able to move. Everything
is in place.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: She would if she could.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Then all my surgery is no good. There’s
something wrong with the child – something I don’t know – something I
can’t define – can’t diagnose. I can do nothing for her.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Well, I’ll be off – unless you have a fare for
me here – some gentleman a little taken with wine.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Wait a bit and MacFarlane will be wanting to
be freighted home.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: The Doctor MacFarlane?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Aye. In the other room and getting stiffer
than the bodies he demonstrates.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’ll look in on him.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Toddy –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Oh, it’s you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit
down. Have a glass with me.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You’re uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More
like the old days.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I want someone to talk to. That Fettes –
all taken up with the widow. He never came back here.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You know something about the human body,
Gray.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’ve had some experience.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Then you can understand that the
backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held
together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’ve never had it all explained that way to me
by so learned a man.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I set those blocks together, patched the
muscles. I put the nerves where they should be – I did it and I did it
right – and she won’t walk –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Oh, it’s the bit of a girl Fettes was talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: The same. Look here, Gray –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I fitted them together like this – – so
that it was right. Yet she won’t walk.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You can’t build life like you put together
blocks, Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What are you talking about? I am an
anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: And you’re a fool, Toddy – and no doctor. It’s
only the dead ones that you know.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I am a doctor. I teach medicine.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In
cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood
flow?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: The heart pumps it.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they
go and why things are remembered and forgot?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: The nerve centers – the brain –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: But what makes a thought start?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: In the brain, I tell you. I know.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You don’t know and you’ll never know or
understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those
things. Look –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Look at yourself, Toddy, could you be a doctor
– a healing man – with the things those eyes have seen? There’s a lot of
knowledge in those eyes, but there’s no understanding. You’d not get
that from me.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could
make her walk, but she won’t - she won’t –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I’ll
take you home and we’ll be friends again – now that you know that you’re
Knox’s man and my friend – aye, forever.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’m my own man and I’ll have no more to
do with you, Gray.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Why should I be afraid of you? What are
you holding over me?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’ll tell you what, Toddy. It’s because I ran
down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob
yelling for my blood. It’s because you were afraid to face it – and
you’re still afraid.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: No, I’m not afraid. Tell! Shout it from
the housetops! And remember this – they hanged Burke – they mobbed Hare
– but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you
say.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: There is much in what I say, Gray, and
if you have any regard for your neck you’ll leave now and stay away from
my house, my school, and from me.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I have no wish for a rope cravat. I’ve never
liked the smell of hemp, so I’ll bid you good night, Doctor
MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Ah – Dr. MacFarlane’s man – A surprise visit,
but come in – come in.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You’re welcome to my little nest, Joseph – is
it not? That’s right – you have something to say to me – something very
private.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Now that is very interesting – Take a chair,
Joseph,</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Can anyone hear what we say?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Only Brother.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I know that you kill people to sell
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You say you’ve come here on your own account?
No one knows you are here?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Give me money or I’ll tell the police you
murder the “subjects.”</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Well, you shall have money, Joseph. Why should
you not?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I don’t suppose the great Dr. MacFarlane is
too free with his pay, is he?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Here – have some of this.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You want money and you shall have it.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Let me see – five and five – then in gold –
six all together. Shall we say sixteen pounds, Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I have made you give me money, but you
smile. Aren’t you angry?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: No, Joseph. I’m not angry – here – another
glass of brandy –I’ll wager it’s better than the doctor’s.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Drink up, man!</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I have an idea – a splendid idea – such an
excellent idea that we must drink on it.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You see – I admire you, Joseph. Coming here
shows courage. I’m looking for such a man – but – drink, Joseph,
drink..</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You and I should work together.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: You mean we would sell the bodies to the
doctors together? Dig them up?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too
well guarded. We will “Burke” them,</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Burke them?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I come from Lisbon.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: But still you may have heard the peddlers of
verse cry out their names on the streets.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: “The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair. The
villain Burke, the meager Hare –”</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I never heard that song. But what did they
do?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Eighteen persons they killed and sold the
bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a
small. That’s good business, Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: But where did they get those people?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: That was Hare’s end. Ah, you should have seen
him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he
cozened her!</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: “A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would
you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come
with me to my house and I’ll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to
drink if you like.” Ah, how he cozened them.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: We could do that. But when he had them
there, then what?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: “Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away
their victim’s life – No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their
lately welcome guest.”</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I don’t understand the song. Tell me plain
how they did it.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I’ll show you how it was done, Joseph. – I’ll
show you how they “Burked” them.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: No, put your hand down. How can I show you,
man!</p>
<p><strong>gray’s voice</strong>: This is how they did it, Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: You’ve no need to be so anxious, Meg,
MacFarlane’s been drunk and away before. He’ll be home in good time.
Meanwhile, you’ve got me to keep you company.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’d call that no good fortune.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: There was a time, lassie – a time when I used
to bring the dashing young doctor to your door – when you didn’t feel so
uncommon cold to your old friend Gray.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Why must you be on him all the time? Why does
it please you?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: He’s my friend. I like to see my friends – I
like to visit them –</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Well, he’s come home – you’ve no excuse now to
bear me company.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What are you going here? Have I not told
you –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony,
Meg?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Crony indeed!</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You can get out.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane –
an interesting specimen – in very good condition.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’ve ordered nothing from you.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: This is a gift.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I take no gifts from you.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: This is a gift you’ll not return.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Wait, Toddy. That’s not hospitable. I want to
discuss business.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You are not to set foot in here again,
Gray, for business or any other reason. And you’re going out now!</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I wouldn’t do it, Toddy. I wouldn’t be rough
handed.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: If you were to throw me out, it might become
known that when the great Dr. MacFarlane finds his anatomy school
without “subjects” – he provides them himself and from the midst of his
own household —</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What the devil are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Take a look downstairs. Toddy. Take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Fettes – where is Fettes?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Fettes, were you down here when Gray
came?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Bring that candle over here.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: – a member of his household –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Fettes, the more things are wrong, the
more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as
you did with, the street singer – complete dissection – a proper entry
in the book –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What do you mean, Fettes?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’ll have no more to do with it. I’ll not
put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Don’t be a fool. One can’t begin and
then stop – and because that entry of the girl’s body is in your hand,
you’ll do as I say. As for me, I’ll tend to Gray.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You’re not going to Gray.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: He must leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Come, Mistress Cameron – this is no place for
you. I’ll help you upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You must leave this house.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I can’t do that – you heard MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane
and be warned.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: He’s a great doctor – a great man –</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his
bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his
own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world’s sake and his
success?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He could have been a great man – a good man and
a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the
old ways to hold him back – and always Gray – Gray to hound him to his
death.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: You’re over-excited, Mistress Cameron.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’m cold as ice.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But Gray’s only a cab driver – a
Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and
again.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: If he were only that. The man’s evil himself.
Some day you’ll know him as MacFarlane knows him – for MacFarlane he was
to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered
with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door
and my love. There is all that between them and more – Burke and Hare
and Knox –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But that’s long since. Gray can’t threaten
him with that.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the
trial?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It
was a famous case.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: And did you hear them speak of the porter who
testified against Burke?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: They did not tell you how that porter cried out
in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard – how he
cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: That porter was Gray and the gentleman of
consequence who couldn’t swallow the shame of it – who took my last
paltry savings to hire Gray –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: MacFarlane</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Listen to me, Fettes, I’m one part befuddled
with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part
fey. You’re a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we
Highlanders call the second sight.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’ve heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: It’s a gift to my people – and I see MacFarlane
and Gray– the pit yawns for them and the flames – and I would have you
away from them and safe out of the torment.–</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: This is unexpected, Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I wanted to see you. You weren’t here –
so I waited.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane.</strong>: What do you want of me. Gray?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Want of you, Toddy? I want nothing of you.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Gray, I must rid myself of you – you’ve
become a cancer – a malignant, evil cancer – rotting my mind.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: So, Toddy, you’ve made me a disease, eh?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I can’t understand your hurt to me – but
I must cut you out.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I will not leave here until I have
finished with you. Gray. One way or another – I must be sure that I am
rid of you.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: And if there is no other way –</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Surely you are not threatening an old friend,
Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: We have never been friends.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Have another glass of something good,
Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’ve drunk enough tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Another little drop’ll never do you any
harm.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Drink –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You’re getting old, Gray, and it’s a
hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh
–</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: I have other means of sustenance.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: The Resurrection business? That may end
sooner than you think. New laws may come.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What I was going to say is this –
wouldn’t you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Would you bribe me to leave you be?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I would make you rich.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: It wouldn’t be half so much fun for me. Toddy,
as to have you come here and beg –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Beg – beg of you! You crawling graveyard
rat!</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Aye – that is my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Well then – I beg you – I beseech you
–</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: But then I wouldn’t have the fun of having you
come here and beg again, Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: But why, Gray? Why?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no
more, Toddy. You’re a pleasure to me.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: A pleasure to torment me?</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: No – a pride to know that I can force you to
my will. I’m a small man – a humble man – and being poor, I’ve had to do
much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane
jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man – and if I have not that, I
have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Let be, Toddy. Let be. I have no wish to hurt
you.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: Stay, Toddy – don’t force me to kill you – I
have need of you – the great need of my pride.</p>
<p><strong>gray</strong>: That’s better Toddy. That’s more
reasonable,</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Where is Fettes?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He’s gone. I sent him away. I’ll not see
another boy harried and torn and made miserable like you, Toddy.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You’ve been with Gray again.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You’d better look at the face.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: You’d, better.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I’m rid of him forever.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: He’ll not come here again – sneaking and
whining and bullying.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Now he’ll serve a good purpose – and
tomorrow when the last bit of him is dissected, demonstrated and
detailed in the students’ notebooks, then at last there’s an end to
him.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Next day I’ll take his horse and cab to
sell at the Pennycuick fair. Then not a trace left – rid of him
forever.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You’re not rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I thought this was a school day.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I am not at the school anymore. I left last
night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Left Dr. MacFarlane?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: Play by yourself a little. I’d like’ to
speak to Mr. Fettes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. harsh</strong>: This is serious, Donald. What has
happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: It’s not because of Georgina – because
of Dr. MacFarlane’s failure?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: It’s not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane
has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he
couldn’t teach me the poetry of medicine.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: That’s why I don’t want to go on. I feel
MacFarlane had me on the wrong road –a road that led to knowledge but
not to healing. If there had been any healing in the man, Georgina would
be walking now.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Mommie! Mommie!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: I think it was the pain of the operation
more than anything else – she’s afraid that if she stands the pain will
come again. Nothing Dr. MacFarlane could ever do would take that out of
her mind.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Mommie! Mommie!</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Mommie – the white horse – I’m sure it’s
the white horse –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Even so, I could never think of going on –
I’ve got to find some other profession.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. marsh</strong>: It is a pity.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: Mommie! It was another horse.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: You’re standing, Georgina.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: You’ll not need that again, Georgina.</p>
<p><strong>georgina</strong>: I wanted to see the white horse –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: I’ve got to tell Dr. MacFarlane. I’ve got to
tell him.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Mistress Cameron – you’ll not believe it,
but the child has walked – stood and walked. I must tell
Dr. MacFarlane.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He’s not home.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Where can I find him?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You don’t went to find him. Your news will keep
until I tell him.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: But I must tell him – he must know of it.
Please – tell me where he is.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: There’s no standing between a fool and his
folly. If you must babble your news to him he’s at the Fisherman’s
Tryst. It’s the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane’s horse and gig
to get there. He’ll welcome the ride back.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: At Pennycuik. I know the inn. I can be there
in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands
for the next day.</p>
<p><strong>horse dealer</strong>: A sound horse and a closed carriage –
and after I’d talked with him a bit I had his price down to four pounds
and then.</p>
<p><strong>horse dealer</strong>: And worth every bit or ten pounds.</p>
<p><strong>maidservant</strong>: Surely, Angus, a man who had won so
great a victory in a horse deal would buy the poor loser a drink.</p>
<p><strong>horse dealer</strong>: Take him a pot of ale.</p>
<p><strong>maidservant</strong>: Ale for a Gentleman? It’s only French
brandy he’d be drinking, and that will be two more shillings, Angus.</p>
<p><strong>maidservant</strong>: The man who bought your horse would
like you to have a glass of French brandy at his charge.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Now that’s very civil of him.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Doctor – the little Marsh girl stood and
walked – really stood and walked –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What’s that you say?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: The little girl – she couldn’t walk far –
the muscles are too weak – but she did stand and she took a step or
two.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I know it – I know it – The moment I was
rid of him –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Gray – I’m rid of him –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Just that – just that – I’ve managed to
get him to leave Edinburgh – he’ll bother me no more.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Drink.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Here’s to a good riddance.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Now that he’s gone I’ll be a new man,
Fettes, and a better teacher. The doctors from my school will perform
miracles –</p>
<p><strong>maidservant</strong>: Sh-h-h! Still your song, lads – the
MacCreadys are here and they’ve come from burying the old woman in
Glencorse Kirkyard.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: See that, Fettes?</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: A burial party – poor people – it’s hard to
bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and
lonely.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Glencorse – that’s a lonely cemetery,
Fettes, not a soul around for miles.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: They’ll be thinking of that, too.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Tosh! Fettes! It’s not their grief I’m
worrying about – I’m talking of our own end –</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: You’ve no thought of going there?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Did you think Gray was the only one who
could handle a mattock and shovel? I’ve had some practice in the
art.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: You couldn’t do that, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: I pass up no opportunities, I’ve a whole
course of lectures in mind for you fellows. We’ll need subjects to
demonstrate. Come along.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Why not? I must have subjects. It’s the
only way I can teach. It’s the only way you can learn. The stupidity of
the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no – nor will they
force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our
own dirty work – and we must.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane’s voice</strong>: So we can’t do without Mister
Gray - So I’d never be rid of him, eh?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: A-ah!</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Where shall we put it? In the back?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: No room there. We’ll have to set it
between us.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Keep it off me, will you!</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: What’s got into this animal!</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Keep it off me!</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Keep it off me, I say!</p>
<p><strong>gray’s voice</strong>: You’ll not get rid of me that way –
that way – that way – that way –</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Fettes – for Mercy’s sake, let’s have a
light!</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: It’s changed! I swear it! It’s changed,
Fettes!</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Changed? Changed, to what?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Let’s have that lamp.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: This is not a woman!</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: It was a woman when we put her in.</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Hold that lamp up – I must see her
face.</p>
<p><strong>fettes</strong>: Dr. MacFarlane?</p>
<p><strong>macfarlane</strong>: Gray – Gray –</p>
