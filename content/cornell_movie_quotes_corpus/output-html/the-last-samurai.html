<h1 id="the-last-samurai">the-last-samurai</h1>
<p><strong>winchester rep</strong>: the leader in all forms of armament
used by the United States Army. When you need a friend, Winchester is by
your side. .</p>
<p><strong>winchester rep</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen … the
Winchester Corporation is proud to bring to you… a true American hero. A
patriot who has proven his gallantry time and again on the field of
battle.</p>
<p><strong>winchester rep</strong>: I hope you will join us in welcoming
…Late of the U.S. Cavalry. The Savior of Sutter Hill … Captain Nathan
Algren!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: My thanks, Mr. McCabe… Ladies and Gents.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: … On that fateful day, Johnny Reb had us in
a spot, perched on the lonely top of Sutter’s Hill, nothing but grey as
far as the eye could see: Unhorsed and out of ammunition, I gazed down
into the, um, mael… mael… -maelstrom below us, and saw them moving
up.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I knew it was fight or die. Into the teeth
of the enemy or we would all be buried… buried … Shit… …on the same hill
with our comrades a1ready gone to Merciful Heaven…</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: They’re coming, Nate.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Keep your head down.</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: Papa alwa ys said we should’ve joined the
navy.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What’d he know? You watch me now. Do
whatever I say. .</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: Aye-a ye, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: How’re the horses?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Better than you. Smell better, too. Can you
hold on, Zeb?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: I got I choice?</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: We need a flag. Find me a goddamn white
flag!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Surrender, damn it! That’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No thought of surrender among those boy.
Better to die as God made us, we thought, as soldiers… So I gave the
order. Mister Bugler, sound mount up. Mister Bugler, sound prepare arms.
There were only thirty of us, but we had fire in us yet. I looked down
the hill at the destiny ordained for us. And gave the order. Mister
Bugler, charge!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And straight into them we went…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: “Hip-hip hurray” we shouted, for we had
spirit in us yet–</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Before they knew what hit them, we had
broken through into the rear of the rebel army.</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: We did it, bro’, WE DID IT! Whoeeeee!!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Davey—!!!!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And the 23rd rode on to glory.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Now let me: tell you, gentlemen, if there’s
one thing on earth I could have had with me on that glorious day, it
would have been this beauty…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The Winchester Model ‘73 lever-action rifle.
15 shot capacity, one round-per-second, accurate at 400 yards. You’ll
note the patented loading port just beneath the cartridge chamber and
the smooth cocking action. …Lets’ just see here–</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Smooth trigger action, too.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: This is, gentlemen, The Gun That Is Winning
The West… Step on up and take a look. Mr. McCabe is here to answer any
question and take orders. I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>winchester rep</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Got their attention, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>winchester rep</strong>: Boston in three weeks. And sober
this time.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: June 17th, 1876. The dead are with me
tonight. They return each time I am obliged to tell their story.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I can almost see them in the shadows, their
bodies whole and beautiful once more. Sometimes it’s as if they call to
me in a sweet invitation –</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: “We are dead,” they whisper, “and we are
happy.”</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: “Do not be afraid,” they whisper. “You have
been dead, too.”</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Is this why they gave their lives? So that I
might disgrace their memory?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And why, after taking so many lives, do I
find myself incapable of taking just one more?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Go awa y.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Not exactly the greeting I imagined.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Thought you’d seen the last of me, I
expect.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Zeb…</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: … Saw your little melodrama toda y. Very
inspiring… .</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Given up soldiering to become a critic?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Got a job for you, unless you’re running for
office…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I have I job.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: I mean a real job. Back in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’ m retired.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: I don’t mean a U.S. uniform.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Nathan, good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Colonel Bagley…</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Sit down. This is Mr. Omura, from Japan, and
his two associates who, so far as I can tell, don’t have names…</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: They’re looking to hire real American
soldiers to create the first Japanese Imperial Army.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Japan’s got it in mind to become a civilized
country and they’re willing to spend what it takes to hire white experts
to do the job right.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Sergeant Gant has already agreed to serve.
You would be m y second-in-command.</p>
<p><strong>algren.</strong>: With approval from Washington, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Both governments prefer to consider our
mission unofficial. We’d be there as non-combatants</p>
<p>****: only, advisors to the Japanese officers. Help them with
training, ordinance and the like.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: You ought to think about it., Captain. Unless
you intend to take up a career in the theater.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I have an agreement with the Winchester
Corporation – I’m sure these people have some concept of what an
agreement is.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: You are paid seven dollars for each
performance. You do, on average, fourteen performances a year. We will
pay you 400 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: A year?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: June 23, 1876. It is impossible, standing
here, not to appreciate one’s, own insignificance.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Here there is neither past, nor future. Only
an oblivion of water.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And yet I ask myself, will the dead follow
me across the ocean to this strange new land?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: …After the Shogun gave up power, the daimyos
� you would call them warlords –knew that Japan needed a centralized
government. So they asked</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: the hereditary Emperor, His Highness the
Enlightened Meiji, to lead the country.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And these warlords just … gave up hundreds
of years of power?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Economic incentives were offered. Most
provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of modernization.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What about those that didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: To deal with those who have resisted, the
Emperor has decided to create an Army with allegiance only to him… We
considered hiring advisors from Germany, but your Ambassador reminded us
of your experience in suppressing rebellious elements in your Civil
War.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Who are we supposed to be fighting
against?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: His name is Mori Katsumoto. He is
samurai.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Samurai?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: The word you might use it “warrior”. But that
does not quite capture it … Katsumoto once served the Emperor but he is
now a traitor who leads a band of traitors. He must be punished.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You told them about our experiences together
on Sutter’s Hill, did you, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: They know I was your commanding officer.
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen. I need some air. I’m
sure Colonel Bagley can amuse you with more stories of patriotic
gore.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: He is insolent.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Get him in front of the troops, you’ll see.
Top of his class at West Point. Brilliant tactician. Even wrote a
book.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Why did he leave your army?</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: What’s a hero to do when there’s no more
great battles?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Is that an evasive answer?</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Sir, this man was left for dead at Sutter’s
Hill. Doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating, but before they
could bury him, he came back to life. After the war he fought the Sioux,
the Cree, and the Blackfoot. Point him at the enemy. He was born for
it.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: I hope you realize the kind of second chance
this is for you. I won’t tolerate insubordination.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Court-martial me.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Would you rather I hadn’t recommended you
for the medal. Nathan? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: We both know why you helped me, Colonel.
Don’t expect me to go all weepy with gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: I expect you to do your job. Save the
self-pity for your own time.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Hate boats. If the Lord bad wanted man to sail
he wouldn’t have created infantry.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: How many rimes you puke today?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: I’m down to two.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: I understand you are a scholar, Captain
Algren. Have you read his book., Mr. Gant?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Can’t say I have.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: An analysis of the triumph of weapons
technology over antiquated military tactics.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: A real page-turner. Sold twelve copies.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Nonetheless, I was impressed. I enjoy reading
military history. I spent two years studying English at Princeton
University.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And where did you learn to speak
Japanese?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Yes, and in Japanese there are twenty-seven
words for “war.” I will be impressed if you learn only half of them.
.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I got twenty-seven words too - Reb, Sioux,
Pawnee, Blackfoot, Jappo. Only one language when it comes to war.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Captain Algren, this is Mr. Simon Graham. He
will be your translator.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Pleasure, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: You’ll be quartered at the Embassy for
now.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: The Emperor will summon you at his
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: If you please, Captain…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They’re gonna carry us?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’re guests of the Emperor. You cannot
walk.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Why the hoods?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: So you won’t have to burden your eyes by
looking at slaves. Oh, excuse me, they’re servants now. This wa y,
gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Twenty years ago Yokohama was a lovel y
little port. Then your Commodore Perry arrived and changed all that.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: All this in twenty years?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Japan has…embraced… Western wa ys. Hired
lawyers from France, doctors from Germany, naval architects from
Britain, civil engineers, railway designers, scientists, teachers. And,
of course, warriors from the United States.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Buying the future.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Or selling the past…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No chairs? . .</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Correct. And this– ..is your bed.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Your pillow.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You mean to say there are no real beds in
Japan?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: For its entire history Japan his been
completely aakoku, I “closed country.” Thirty years ago, if you had
washed up on Japanese soil… you would have been beheaded on sight. Now,
they let you keep your head… and give you a wooden pillow.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I remember when it was just America and the
Dutch. Now ever ybody’ s getting into the game.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The Germans are particularly eager.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Same thing your country wants. Most favored
nation status.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: How long have you been in Japan?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Oh, western time quickly loses its meaning
here … I first came as part of the British legation in 1857. But I was
soon relieved of m y position, as a result of various…disagreements with
the Crown’s attitude toward the locals.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Gentlemen. I hope you are enjoying a taste of
home.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’ve done with worse, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: America has much to offer us, though. Its’
industry and ingenuity are without peer. I have spoken to the Emperor
about you. He is interested in the most modem theories of warfare.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I look forward to the opportunity of meeting
him someday.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: You will have that chance sooner than you
think. He has requested an audience.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Remember that he is arahitogami. A god in
human form. During the last two hundred years no emperor was even seen
by commoner. You may look at him, with deference, but do not speak
unless you are spoken to.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: The Emperor bids you welcome. He wishes you
to know that he is most grateful for the assistance your country offers
ours, in order to rid ourselves of the brutality of the provincial
warlords - and to accomplish the same national harmony which you enjoy
in your homeland.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: The Emperor is most interested in your
American Indians, and wishes to know if you have seen them
firsthand.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I have seen many of them, and have fought
them, too. They are very brave.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Thank… you… very …much.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: That young pup runs this country?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That “pup” runs the country no more than I
do. He was installed as a figurehead at age twelve when the warlords
realized Japan needed a central government. But don’t be fooled – he may
be a powerless god, but to these people he’s a god nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Gentlemen, may I present General Yoshitaka.
He will assist you in training the army.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: General.</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/graham</strong>: He greets you with extreme
courtesy and asks if you are ready to meet the Imperial Army.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Jesus….</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Ask the General what training they’ ve
had.</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/ graham</strong>: He sa ys… We have trained them
not to shoot their …asses off.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sergeant Gant, have the men stand to
attention.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Imperial Army, Atten-tion!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: For God’s sake, let’s not keep it a secret
who’s in charge here … Mr. Gant.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: August 4,1876. As I watch this new army
train, I cannot help but think of those who rode with me in me 23rd
cavalry.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: For four years they had survived, never once
shrinking from the fire. And so, when given my order to charge the
advancing rebel infantry, they never hesitated. …And they all died.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Now I am training another army. In another
civil war.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Is this why I was spared? Once again to lead
men to their death?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Ask him if they have a flag.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No flag.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They need a flag.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … I’ve been doing this for years. Trying to
capture it before it’s all gone. Afraid I’m losing the battle.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Mr. Graham…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Ah… now this should be interesting… He’s
waiting for them to show deference.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That…is a samurai.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … Before the edicts ever y citizen had to
prostrate himself in the presence of a samurai.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What edicts are those?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The Council of State has been passing a
series of laws designed to eliminate the samurai.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Because you are here now, Sergeant… For the
last 800 years guarding Japan and fighting her wars was the exclusive
occupation of the samurai.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Men like Mori Katsumoto were the most elite
caste in Japanese societ y until the Council of State – led by your
friend Omura - decided the whole class had to go … … Most of the samurai
accepted the new laws. But some didn’t. Or couldn’t. Like Katsumoto.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: General Yoshitaka bids you to remember that
the word samurai means “one who serves.” Their whole existence is based
on serving their country as warriors.</p>
<p><strong>graham .</strong>: Your Imperial Army is taking awa y their
only reason for being … So what are they to do now?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: This is sake?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Sake. Rice wine.</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka</strong>: Hie! Sake.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sake.. Good.</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Vexing people, the samurai. Blood-thirsty,
honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. Wanted to write a book about
them for years, but no Westerner can get close enough.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Ask him if he ever saw a samurai in
battle.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He is samurai.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: My friend and I were looking for some
companionship…</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Ladies of the evening? Hootchie-contchie?
Boom-Boom?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Zeb. …so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Universal language. boyo.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: That one’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No tea… Sake.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Fan dance. Saw this once in Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Okay, darlin’ time to get down to
business:</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Zeb. I don’t think she –</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: She’s just shy. Who knows what we white devils
have got in our trousers, eh, darlin’?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Come on, now.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Now, hold on there, sister. I paid good
money.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Back off, short-stuff.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Obviousl y you can kick the shit out of
people much larger than you, so we’ll be leaving now…</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/ graham</strong>: The General wishes to know if you
bad a pleasant evening?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: It was… educational Would the General mind
telling me more about our common enemy?</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/graham</strong>: … Mori Katsumoto is an extremely
charismatic leader. To those who honor the old ways, he’s a hero. His
force is estimated at about five hundred and growing by the day. All
samurai.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What kind of man is be?</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/graham</strong>: Katsumoto has no fear. He has no
pity. He is kotsutai– the soul of old Japan … He is my honored
kinsman.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Kinsman?</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/graham</strong>: We grew up together in Yoshino.
Marched together and fought together. He is Kaishaku the brother of my
spirit.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Ask him what kind of guns Katsumoto has.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The samurai don’t use guns.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No, ask him what kind of firearms they
have.</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/graham</strong>: The samurai no longer dishonor
themselves by touching firearms.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Colonel Bagley requires you.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They’re not a fighting unit yet</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: We have no choice. –the railroad has been
stopped here. Just as it entered Yoshino, Katsumoto’s province.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Captain, we cannot govern a country in which
we cannot tr avel freel y. … Katsumoto’s provocation is strategic. His
defeat will demonstrate to the other disloyal samurai that resistance is
an act devoid of honor.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: The rebels don’t have a single rifle.
They’re savages with bows and arrows. You get up there and show ‘em how
it’, done.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: With respect, sir, I need more time.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: With all due respect. this railroad cannot
wait.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: You think we’re the only country interested
in Japan?! You don’t think the Germans and the French would like to
oversee the new army?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Colonel–</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Why do you think we’re here, Captain?
Because Remington and Colt and Winchester have powerful allies in
Washington. We’re here to sell a shitload of American guns…and steel…and
timber. That shouldn’t be bud for a Winchester whore like you to
understand.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Yes, air.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What is that sign?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s the symbol for the Omura Zaibatsu.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Zaibatsu?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Old family businesses that own ever ything
worth owning. The molt powerful is the Omura Zaibatsu. That’s your
friend, Omura.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They own all of this?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They do now.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: October 24,1876. Today we entered Kansai
province. Here the local warlords have all been convinced to accept the
emperor’s rule.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Our destination is Yoshino, home of the
rebel Katsumoto. Protected by high mountain passes, it can be reached
only during the summer months, and even then with great difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: A long march. And then a battle. A new
enemy, but the same feeling I had in my guts at twenty-one, in the
cornfield at Antietam – men will die here, today, and will I be among
them?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Ask him how they’ll come at us.</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/ graham</strong>: They’ll come straight on. They
will push forward and keep on attacking… And he adds that there is no
samurai word for “retreat.”</p>
<p><strong>yoshitaka/graham</strong>: He sa ys they’re coming…</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Captain Algren, have you posted a rear guard
to protect our supply train?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Who is overseeing their deployment?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No one.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Mr. Graham, you will accompany me to the
rear. I want to be certain we are protected from any surprise
assault.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: …I’m going to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Waste of good ammo.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sergeant Gant, order the troops to assume
staggered firing positions.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Imperial Army, assume staggered firing
positions.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Hold the line … hold the line…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Hold the line!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sound fall back! Sound fall back!</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You cannot escape. We are deep in the
mountains and winter is coming.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sake.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Sake?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sake.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sake.</p>
<p><strong>ujio</strong>: My lord, why do you spare the barbarian? He is
shamed in defeat, be should kill himse1f.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: The barbarian doesn’t know hit shame.</p>
<p><strong>ujio</strong>: Then I will kill him.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Ujio-San, he will still be shamed
tomorrow or in a month. For now there are things I wish to learn.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sake!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Sake…</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: They are training.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Training what?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Their minds. It is called bushido…</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: The wa y of the warrior. We study from
when we are young. Are my words correct?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I will practice my Eng1ish with you.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Why do you learn English?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: To know m y enemy.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: If I am your enemy, why have you not killed
me?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Was General Yoshitaka your enemy?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: No, I honor his memory as my kinsman.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: That why you helped him kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: If a samurai is defeated in battle, he
must take his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture. It is
required that his kaishaku his trusted friend, help him. I was honored
to by his kaishaku.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Hell of an honor.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: It was his destiny. He knew it, he died
at peace.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Who was the warrior in the red armor?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: My son-in-law. His name was Hiroshi.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And the woman who cares for me?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: My daughter, Hiroshi’s wife. Her name is
Taka.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I killed her husband?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: It was an honorable death.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You hope I choke on it, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You want to poison it and watch me fall over
the table and foam at the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: I promise I’ll make him take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: Soon. Please.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Who are you people anywa y?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You have no God, you have no mercy, you
don’t even have any fucking walls. Your walls are made of paper, what’s
the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: This man tries to kill me and I’ve done
nothing to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act like, what?
Like I’m a guest in your house. What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Do you have a soul at all?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the
Japanese sword.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Is that what he’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: At what age did you become I soldier?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: To fight in your American civil war.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Tell me about that war’.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Everything about the civil war?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: That would take a year.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You have pressing business elsewhere?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The civil war began on April 12. 1861 when
the rebs attacked Fort Sumter. Well, actually, it probabl y began three
years earlier when the Supreme Court decided a runaway slave had to be
returned to his master</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: –and Pickett says he wants to do it, over
Longstreet’s objections and Lee doesn’t know what to think, but he lets
him. So 15,000 men go up that hill. And most of them die.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Was that wise?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No, it was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The point of a battle is to win, or at least
have enough men survive to fight another day.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You did not try to survive when we took
you prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: What do you want for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You know they’re not going to ransom me.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: We have little use for money.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Then what are you doing, why are you asking
me these questions, what is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: The snows will melt in May, and the
passes will open, and the events of the world will unfold. Until that
time, you are here. I enjoyed this conversation in your English. I hope
you will honor me with more tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Day unknown, month unknown, 1876. I continue
to live among these strange people.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Each day I am confounded by their strange
customs and contradictions, savagery followed by mildness.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They seem to value nothing more than their
families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded men without a shade of
remorse..</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: . Raisu?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Not so fast Ko…toba? What is this?</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Hashi.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Hashi.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Hail!</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Yoritomo.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Algren.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: All-gren.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Higen. Toshiie. Taka.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Higen. Toshiie. Taka.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: The parliament of your country has two
houses. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: To keep either one from being too
powerful.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Does not a people need a powerful ruler
to protect them?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: We believe the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I have a question. How do you come to speak
English?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Members of the Council were required to
study I helped restore the Emperor to the throne.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: So that Japan could have a powerful ruler to
protect it.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And now you must hate him for what he’s
done.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: He is my blood. I serve him with my
life.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: By fighting his army?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I do not fight the emperor. I fight those
who seek to influence him, those who betray the soul of my country.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: The Emperor gave this blade to my
ancestors 400 years ago. It has been used only to defend his sacred
honor.</p>
<p><strong>katsmuoto</strong>: It takes many years to make a sword. It
is a holy Act. A samurai’s sword is his soul.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: This sword is flawed. What is this uneven
line near the edge?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: One man is flexible and compromises too
much to avoid conflict. Another man is so fierce he wins ever y battle,
but so rigid he can never know peace. A man who knows both is the
perfect warrior. The lame is true of a blade .. one steel bends, and the
other cuts. And where they meet is never perfect Hold the blade up.
.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Some believe a blade is thirsty until it
tastes the blood of its enemy.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The crew at Winchester can produce one rifle
ever y seven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: We gave up firearms two hundred years
ago. It takes no courage to kill. A man from half a mile awa y. You must
look into the eyes of your enemy to know who you have killed.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’m not sure an artillery officer would
agree.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I think all killing’s a filthy business.</p>
<p><strong>katsumo</strong>: TO Taking a man’s life is nothing. It is
his honor you can never take awa y.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: In other words you have no respect for human
life.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And what is yours? To rebel against the
future? I fought the South in our civil war. Their leaders believed they
were fighting for “honor” just as you do. And their people died by the
thousands!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And my wife is dead.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Mine, too.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Tomorrow we will discuss your country’s
wish for dominance in the…“Far East.”</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: …I look forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: March 9. 1877. I have never known such a
disciplined people.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: From the moment they wake, they devote
themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue–</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And yet the more time I spend here, the less
I understand them.</p>
<p><strong>ext. village day</strong>: Two women are bowing repeatedly,
chattering in smiling, earnest argument.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Everyone is polite, every nuance of behavior
seems to have a great meaning, and increasingly I am convinced that the
lower they bow, the leas they mean it.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And I am sure they regard my wa ys to be as
confounding and unfathomable as I find theirs.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: A1gren -San. Please forgive. Too many
mind.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Mind sword, mind face, mind people watch,
too many mind. No mind.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No mind?</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Hai! No mind. You try.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Your majest y, beg permission to approach.
Your humble servants are most anxious to know if his Majest y has signed
the order regarding the railroad progress.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I am most impressed at the wa y the
blossoms float upon the air, as if held by unseen hands.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Yes, they represent the highest form of
gyoko. About the order, your Majest y.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: This railroad must go through Yoshino
Province?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: It is absolutely necessar y your
Highness.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: If you sa y so, I shall sign.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: A perfect blossom is a rare thing…</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: You could spend your life looking for
one. And it would not be a wasted life.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Were you praying?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Just sitting… I do not think I have the
word. Satori it means, maybe, awareness.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: This moment alone, apart from all others
… You know this? I am writing a poem about this time we hive spent. I
have only written one line on “His eyes were like my own but seen
through a deep and troubled ocean.” Can you suggest a second line?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’m not much of a writer.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Is this why you spend so much time with
your journal?</p>
<p><strong>. algren</strong>: How do you know that? She told you.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Did you love her husband as your own
son?</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: You have sent men to their deaths, just
as I have.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The difference is, you feel nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Before you were a soldier, you were a
farmer.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: You lived on a farm. Or in a forest of
trees.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: The wa y you look at the cherry
blossoms.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: We lived in a place called Connecticut.
My…brother and I climbed the maple trees.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Were they beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: And you were sad to see them die in the
winter.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You were something before you were a
soldier. You were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the trees
die.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Like those trees, we are all dying. The
future is an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion.
We live life in every breath. Eat, drink, fuck. Now. Every cup of tea.
Every word we write… Every blossom we hold.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Every life we take.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Life in every breath. That is bushido.
The wa y of the samurai.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I am str uck by these people and their
acceptance of Fate in a1l it s variations. At a time like this, they
seem utterly without sentiment. Even the children have a gravity beyond
their years.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Would last longer … if stone.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: No. House fall. House go back easy with
wood.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And yet I have never seen a people with more
capacity for the joy found in the simplest things of life.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: No, please.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Hai.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: Japanese men do not help with this.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I am not Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: 1… didn’t know he was your husband.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: He did his duty. You did your duty.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And you do yours.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: Hai.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: The Emperor has requested my presence. We
leave tomorrow. You will be released in Tokyo.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: April 13, 1877. Tomorrow we return to
civilization. As eager as I am to be among my own kind, I confess to a
curious reluctance.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: These months have marked me, and I don’t
fully know yet wh y.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I do know it is here that I have known my
first untroubled sleep in many years.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: You are alwa ys welcome in our home.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Domo Arrigato.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: …You will finish it soon.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: If that is my destiny.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: … The Emperor sends a message for you to
return to Tokyo, and you go?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Even though you’re in rebellion against
him.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Against the Emperor? Never. I serve him.
As I have alwa ys done. .</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Our Emperor is young, and there are
things I must sa y to him.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: But ever yone around him wants you dead.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: And if the Emperor desires, I will take
my own life at his command.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: We will stop here for the night.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Sit, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Do you drink tea?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’ve had little else for some time…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: How’s your poem coming?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I am having trouble. The truth is I am
not a very good poet. Do you know wh y you were sent here? To
Yoshino.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: To protect the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>. katsumoto</strong>: Why is the railroad here?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: So Tokyo can control the whole country.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You have seen my province. All mountains.
Far from Tokyo. Yet the rail line must come here?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You have something they want</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: What do they want in my mountains?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Minerals … Gold.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: There is no gold in Japan.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Coal? For steamships.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: And why would steamships be so
important?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: …China.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Japan has nothing. China has ever
ything.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Mine the coal to create a way station for
the trip to China … Freeze the Europeans out and Japan and America have
a monopol y on the China trade.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Add to this the Omura Zaibatsu. You know
the Zaibatus?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The wealthy families.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: As patron of the railroad, Omura owns all
land within four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. As my country
grows, so will his wealth. This is why you are fighting.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And you will tell the emperor to stop
them?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I do not tell the emperor what to do.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Then what do you hope to accomplish?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Will you return to America?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: …I have a job here.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You should return to your home.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Because I do not wish you to be m y enemy
again.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Go home Captain … Anshinritsumai. I wish
you peace.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Algren? My God, you never cease to
astonish.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They have new weapons.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: The Kaiser was only too happy to help. Along
with his friends at Mauser and Krupp. Thank God we Americans still have
a few teeth in our head.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: The ambassador and I have spent eight months
kissing Omura’s ass so he’ll sign the damn trade pact with us. You spent
all this time living with those savages? He’s going to want to talk to
you…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I need a bath.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: And your back pay, I imagine.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: They got their flag. …See?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: No, Mori-san. We arc “civilized” now.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I cannot touch the Sacred One.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You can.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Did you have a pleasant journey, Minister
Katsumoto?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: It was uneventful.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: If it is not a great imposition. I desire a
moment alone with Minister Katsumoto. Omura-San.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: So kind of you, but I fear my old teacher
wishes to upbraid me in private for neglecting my studies.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You rise against me, my teacher.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: No, Highness, I rise against your
enemies.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: They are my teacher, my advisers, like
you.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: They advise in their own interest.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: The world is changing, Mori – you have not
seen what goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science. I
need men who can look outward, or soon we will be left behind, and
defenseless.</p>
<p><strong>katsum oto</strong>: I am sworn to defend you even to my last
breath.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: The samurai live in the past. You cannot
defend against a future you don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: If I am no use, then I will happily end
my life,</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: No, Mori. It is my wish that you rejoin the
Council of State. I need your voice.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: It is your voice that needs to be heard,
Highness. You are a living God, you can do what ever you think is
right.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I am a living God only as long as I do what
they think is right.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Your Highness, may I beg forgiveness for
saying what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic drivel not
worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone a young man I know to have
some modest intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Is it possible a living God can be too
afraid to make his voice heard? Tell me what to do, Mori-San?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You are emperor, my Lord, not me. You
must find the wisdom for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: As soon as they sign the agreement, they’re
obligated to buy the entire weapons package, from Colt revol vers to
Ha1liwell twelve-pounders. Plus this particular item you might
recognize.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: They’ve been calibrated to fire 200 rounds a
minute, The new copper cartridges cut down on jamming.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: May 15, 1877. The city I return to is
immeasurabl y changed</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: As though Tokyo were determined to become
another New York or Chicago .- all in one headlong rush.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: If he asks, you can talk about
ordnance and tactics. But remember, this has to do with a lot more than
just weapons.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Ambassador Swanbeck, if you’ll follow
me.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Please, sit down, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: A gift from Czar Alexander… Captain Algren,.
it seems you have endured your captivity with little ill-effect.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: He’s an extraordinary man, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: He is samurai.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: Mr. Omura, my people have been
drawing up the documents we discussed. I have a draft–</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: We’re not quite ready to announce the treaty,
Ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: The Emperor is…sentimental. Katsumoto was his
old mentor– he is not eager to offend him. It will take I few more
days.</p>
<p><strong>ambassjsw anbeck</strong>: How many da ys is ” a few?”</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: I assure you the Samurai will not stand in
the wa y of our agreement. You are prepared to make deliver y?</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: Soon as your emperor signs on
the dotted line.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Captain Algren you are the expert. Will this
array of ordnance be sufficient?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Depends on what you’re trying to
accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: I want my country to take its place as a
modern power.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Then they will set you well on your way.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: I am pleased.</p>
<p><strong>amdassador sw anbeck</strong>: Mr. Omura, you assured us you
had the influence with your emperor to make this deal come to pass. With
all due respect perhaps there is someone else we should be speaking
to.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: With all due respect, Ambassador, perhaps
there is someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the French.
Or the English. Or any of the legations waiting in the next room.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: Yes, we1l, we look forward to
hearing from you.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Good afternoon, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Captain Algren, perhaps you can stay a moment
And tell me of your experiences in our rebellious provinces.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: You fought bravely on behalf of our army–
against the rebel Katsumoto.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: And yet you helped save his life when
attacked by the Ninja.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: My role was much less significant than you
may have heard.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Tell me about your role in Katsumoto’s
plans.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I have none.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: And your sympathies?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Again, I have none.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: I know you have little sympathy for Colonel
Bagley.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: He is…. unsympathetic.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: I thought it was we who are inscrutable.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: You have gained important knowledge of
Katsumoto’s province, his army, and his rebellion. This is extremely
valuable to me.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: You also possess significant knowledge of m y
army, my weaponry, and my plans. This is extremely va1uable to
Katsumoto.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Again, you flatter me.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: No. I am a businessman. I recognize what is
valuable. And I buy it. In this case, I value your loyalt y.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I didn’t know loyalt y was something that
could be sold.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Then perhaps you will give it, as a token of
future friendship - for which, as a friend, I would be in your debt.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Then I will consider it.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: And I will be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: All righteee, the ANDREW JACKSON leaves
tomorrow � if you want a steamship you’ll have to wait six weeks. Gets
ya to Frisco by the 28th. 14 dollars for a private cabin, 8 for a shared
or 3 for a lower berth. What can I put you down for?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sir..?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Private cabin.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white
man has ever been in your position. Do you have any idea what it will
mean to have Omura as your friend? You want land, you want women, you
want boys?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three
years. You must believe me there is a majest y about these people – can
you imagine what your own country would be if it had half the drive and
the discipline and the belief and the bravery of these ridiculous little
people?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: My God, it’s the edicts…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What edicts?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: That’s enough–</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t be stupid.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Captain, I had not thought to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’m leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need
to tell you what’s going on here.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You mean the Gatling Guns and the
howitzers, is that how you sa y it?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They’re about to close a trade agreement
that will bring this country more weapons than you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura
knows the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to need those weapons
before be will sign.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And you are to be the cause…</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Elegant, isn’t it? Omura passes laws sure
to cause a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons. The Emperor
sees that the weapons are needed so he agrees to the entire treaty,
giving your country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu what it wants.
And my country is sold to yours.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Today the Council passed two edicts. The
first called for the elimination of our traditional topknots.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: The second banned the wearing of
sword.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Hand them to me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: If you do this, they will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: I am hard to kill.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You don’t know what their weapons can do.
All your men butchered … Just for pride.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Not for pride. For the emperor.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: But the emperor is the one signing the
agreement.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: He has not signed it yet.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Is it worth it? … just for these,</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I cannot live without my soul … Can
you?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Minister Katsumoto, you honor us.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: It is my honor to join again the men who
are leading Japan into her glorious future.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: You arc perhaps unaware of this Council’s
edict regarding the wearing of swords?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I read ever y edict with singular
attention.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Yet you would bring weapons into this
chamber?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: This chamber was protected by m y sword
for four hundred years–</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: We need no protection… We are a nation of
laws now.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Does Japan no longer need its
patriots?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Who is the patriot? The man who would keep
his country trapped in the past, or the man who would help his people
into the future?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: A future with no honor,</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Honor means less to me than feeding our
children. And teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so they
will live. .</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: And lining your own pockets in the
process.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret
that I ask you to remove your sword, as this body has declared in its
edict.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: This sword serves the emperor, and only
he can command me to remove it.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Ah, but it is our tradition that the
Emperor’s voice is too pure and great to be heard in such worldly
circumstance as the Council of State.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Then, with great regret, I must refuse to
give up my sword.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to
accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where you will be our honored
guest. I think you will find the surroundings there quite
harmonious.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Brothers … One day you will know what
you have done and feel what I never will … shame.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Thought I’d missed you. Were you going to
leave without even saying goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You sod. Christ, give us. . second here</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’re making a mistake, I promise you.
Katsumoto’s under house arrest, Omura’s made his move – he’ll need you
more than ever –</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Oh, my goodness. How silly of me.. All that
time you were with him, up in those mountains,</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Then you should get out. Because Omura will
become rather impatient with anyone who isn’t on the team.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Case in point.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai
doing odd jobs for his Nibs.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What do they want from me?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: To make sure you’re on the side of God and
Country, or to make sure you get the hell out.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: You’ve been a great help, Graham. I thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Look who’s getting sentimental now.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Take back to quarters. I walk.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Oughtta shave more often, Algren. Becomes
you.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Thought I would follow the Japanese
fashion.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: …Heard you were leaving, actually?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Why would I do that? Omura wants me to train
his personal guard.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Certainly seems obsessed by you. Why do you
think that is?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Could it be my nose isn’t permanently lodged
up his ass?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: Omura, you have a lovel y home.
It must be very old.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Nothing is “old” in Japan, ever ything is
“ancient.” … But the views are pleasant. Sit down…</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Do you know your Wagner, Captain? This is the
‘Leibestod’ from Tristan and Isolde.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’m surprised you enjoy it. Literally
translated it means `love/death. ’ A samurai concept, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Champagne? And cigars, of course.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: A gift from President Grant?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Queen Victoria.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Mr. Omura, may I use the necessit y?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Now, Mr. Swanbeck, regarding our agreement, I
noticed a discrepancy in paragraph seven in reference to the investment
protocols for coal.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: This wa y…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: How’s the poem coming?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: The ending is proving difficult.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: What has become of Captain Algren?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Name’s Simon Graham. Wants to write a book
about you.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: An honor. I have followed your activities
with great interest. I think the European public would be fascinated by
a book about your adventures.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Not a book. A play!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: You go, Algren-san. I will stop them.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: …Please.</p>
<p><strong>yoritomo</strong>: Tell my family.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No. Wait…!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: There’s a wa y out. Look–!</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: This place is designed to keep people from
getting in, not from getting out. We can make it</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: This was your plan?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Do you have a better one?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I may die. But I’ll die trying.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: … 1 don’t know what to say, sir. I never
would have thought him capable of treason.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: I would say Captain Algren’s acts tonight
have assured our success.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. They will
fight. We will destroy them with your new weapons.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: What if he just goes off to the mountains
and becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: You still do not understand us … Katsumoto
can do nothing but fight. It is his role in the drama. He must act out
his destiny. He knows it.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: You trust a lot in destiny.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: This story was written years ago. From the
first sight of your warships in our harbor… It is a1l inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: June 1, 1877. Yesterday, I passed the field
where Zebulon Gant was killed by the man with whom I now ride.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I am beset by ironies – trained to fight
rebels now I am one. And yet 1 ask mysel f… can a man be reborn?:</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And if so, what would he make of it?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: I was prepared to die in Omura’s castle.
And yet here I am. I cannot help but ask why were you sent into my life.
What is the lesson you were meant to give me?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we
thought…</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You…ain’t whistlin’ Dixie…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: … he gave his life to save us. He died
bravel y.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: Thank you, Algren-San.</p>
<p><strong>higen</strong>: Will you fight the white men?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: If they come here, yes.</p>
<p><strong>higen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Because they come to destroy what I have
come to love.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: The wa y of Samurai is difficult for children.
He misses his father.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And he is angry because I am the cause of
that.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: No. He it angry because he fears you will die
as well.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Higen.</p>
<p><strong>higen</strong>: My father taught me it is glorious to die in
battle.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: That is what he believed.</p>
<p><strong>higen</strong>: I would be afraid to die in battle.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: So would I.</p>
<p><strong>higen</strong>: But you have been in many battles.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And I was always afraid.</p>
<p><strong>higen</strong>: I don’t want you to go.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Algren-san.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: They are corning.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I call it five thousand troops. They’ll come
in waves of about a thousand, a few minutes between each wave.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: German formations have the infantry
staggered with on1y light flanking. They’ll come straight on with rifles
and fixed bayonets. Mausers are only accurate to about 150 yards.
They’ll look to overthrow us.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Captain… … Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan
demands your surrender. If you and your fellows lay down your arms you
will not be harmed.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: That is not possible. As Omura knows.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Captain Algren, we will show no quarter. You
ride against us and you are the same as they are.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I take that as a compliment, Colonel. I’ll
look for you on the field.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They have the howitzers.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: About a dozen.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: A man could get lost up there … Build an
army. Hold out a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Algren-san…Have you seen what happens to
the villages that stand In the way of the railroad?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: That is what will happen to my village if
we do not stand and fight. No. We serve the Emperor here.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: By dying?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: At least make it battle, not a suicide.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: And what would that accomplish?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: It might give you one more day … One more
fine day like this.</p>
<p><strong>ext. village night</strong>: It is the eve of battle. And the
samurai rejoice.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: July 14, 1877. For so long now, I have
managed to convince myself that there was nothing worth believing
in.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Certainly nothing worth dying for.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Now I am not so sure.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: And so, for the first time in my life, I am
truly afraid. Not of dying. But of losing something worth living
for.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What is it:? .</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The kenbu,.. his dance of death.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: Algren-san, will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: If you wear this, it will honor us.</p>
<p><strong>ext. katsumoto’s house – porch later that night</strong>: The
quiet evening continues.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: So m y hair will have a pleasing scent
when I meet my ancestors … … You do not do this ?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I studied war at a place called West Point.
They taught us about a battle called Thermopylae. Three hundred brave
warriors held off the king of Persia’s army of a million men. For two da
ys they made them pay so dearly that the king lost all appetite for
further invasion … I have some thoughts about the battle tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Do you really think we can defeat
them?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I sure as hell want to find out.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You believe a man can change his
destiny?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No … But I think a man cannot know his
destiny. He can only do what he can, until his destiny is revealed.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: “I belong to the warrior in whom the old
ways have joined the new.”</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: Return.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: If that is my destiny … Anshinritsumai.</p>
<p><strong>taka</strong>: Anshinritsumai.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Mr. Graham….</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Would you please stay with the horses?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: As you suggest.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Mr. Graham … Take this.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Maybe you can use it for your book.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: The call to advance.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Tell me … what happened to those three
hundred warriors at Thermopylae?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Dead to the last man.</p>
<p><strong>hagley</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny.
Send in the second wave. Two divisions.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They need to regroup and report our
position. Then they’ll come hard.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: It is sad to see brave men die without
faces… You cannot tell one warrior from another.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: They’re not warriors. They’re soldiers. It’s
a modern army.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Not my world anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: A classic “V” ambush. Sonofabitcb is using
Welt Point tactics.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: He was Kaishaku … my trusted friend.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: We won’t be able to hold them back this
time.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: This is not your battle. You do not have
to die here.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I died a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: But now you live again.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: It was not your time.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No. Maybe I survived just to live this one
last day.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: The gatling guns. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>bagley</strong>: Fire! Fire, dammit!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Help me up…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: Just – stay there.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: Help me up.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: My sword…</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: You have your honor again. Let me die
with mine … Kaishaku.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: You must help me. Hold it firmly…</p>
<p><strong>ka tsumoto</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: No, Kaishaku.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: We will ride together again.</p>
<p><strong>katsumoto</strong>: It is perfect… They are all perfect.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: …will usher in an era of
unprecedented prosperity and cooperation between our two great
nations.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Highness, if we could just conclude the
matter at hand…</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: All your enemies are dead, Enlightened
One.</p>
<p><strong>emperor/translator</strong>: You were with him at the
end.</p>
<p><strong>algren/transla tor</strong>: Yes. He asked that I bring you
this – that the strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: En1ightcned One, we all weep for his loss,
but the future of our country lies in-</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000
years. And for all that time we have slept. During my sleep I have
dreamed. I dreamed of a unified Japan. Of a country strong and
independent and modern… And now we are awake. We have railroads and
cannon and Western clothing. But we cannot forget who we are. Or where
we come from.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Ambassador Swanbeck I have concluded that
your treaty is not in the best interests of my people.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swandeck</strong>: Sir, if I may–</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You may not. From this moment on, economic
investment from ever y nation will be considered equally.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador swanbeck</strong>: This is an outrage–</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Enlightened One, we should discuss this</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Omura, do you know our northern island?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: There is a small one called Taraku. A rock
in the sea. There is nothing there but crabs who have been known to tear
a sleeping man apart … I have had a small house constructed on the
island. You will go there now and await our summons.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Sir…?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I hereby seize your family’s assets and
present them as my gift to the people.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Further, I have decided to stop the
railroad cxpansion into Yoshino.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Enlightened One</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You have served your function. I have no
more need of you … You can conspire with the crabs now. Remove
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>omura</strong>: Honored Emperor, I do not know wh y you
disgrace me.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: If your shame is too unbearable … I offer
you this sword.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: The samurai is not a man now. He is an
idea. Tell me how he died.</p>
<p><strong>algren</strong>: I will tell you how he lived.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: …And so the days of the samurai had
ended.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: And in the years to come the Rising Sun of
Imperial Japan would fl y in triumph over Korea, over Russia, even over
China. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own
destiny</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: As for the American Captain, no one knows
what became of him. All that is left is his journal which I have
published, according to his last request.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Some lay he died of his wounds, others that
he returned to his own country…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: But I like to think he may have found at
last some small measure of the peace we all seek, but few of us ever
find.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Anshinritsumai.</p>
