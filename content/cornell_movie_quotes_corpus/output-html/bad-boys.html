<p><strong>bad boys</strong>: Revised Draft</p>
<p><strong>1 ext. miami landscape - night 1</strong>: The sun might be
down, but the city is baking. Waves of heat ascend into the sky while an
unmarked van navigates ACROSS the SCREEN.</p>
<p><strong>2 int. unmarked van - in motion - night 2</strong>: The
driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen- ger seat is a man
dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He looks to the rear.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: What’s taking so long back there?</p>
<p><strong>rear</strong>: Where the rest of the gang waits. NOAH, KUNI,
FERGUSON, and CASPER. All dressed in black like Fouchet, except for
ANDY. He stands and shows off his Miami PD uniform. His English is poor,
yet he’s got a big, happy-to-be- along grin on his face.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How do I look? Like the real thing, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Step back and lemme get a good look at
you.</p>
<p><strong>close shot - rear view mirror</strong>: THROUGH which Eddie
can watch the action. Andy steps further to the rear, almost to the
door, facing the front.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Tell me again about your assignment,
Andrew?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m the decoy.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Right you are.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. van in motion 3</strong>: Andy’s body is blown through
the rear doors as the van turns a corner.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. van - fouchet 4</strong>: He dials 911 on his cellular
phone. Fouchet sounds distressed.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Please help! I just saw a policeman shot!
Send help. Hurry! I’m at the corner of…</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. near downtown - van - night 5</strong>: A stream of PD
CARS haul past, lights blazing and SIRENS on full.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. colony hotel - night 6</strong>: Crowds moving up and
down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people walking. Beautiful people watching.
MUSIC BLENDS from nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to
the hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with:</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: Report of an officer down. Be advised,
all units. Corner of Lennox and Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>a7 int. colony hotel - night a7</strong>: Where the buffed
DESK MANAGER gets off the phone to greet the effeminate pair.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Good evening. I’m Mike –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: – And I’m Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: We’re lookin’ for a couple of our Latin
friends who checked in a little while ago. You might remember them?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: No chest hair. And packin’.</p>
<p><strong>desk manager</strong>: I’m sorry. But our guest list is
private.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Oh, didn’t they say? There’s going to be
party! It’s</p>
<p><strong>b.y.o.b.o. –</strong>: The B.O. stands for baby oil.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Maybe you can come. Get off after you get
off?</p>
<p><strong>desk manager</strong>: Well, now that you mention it. They
were kinda cute. Suite 202.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. colony hotel - stairwell - night 7</strong>: Lowrey
and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster their guns. The posing
is over. This is business.</p>
<p><strong>a8 int. colony hotel - suite 202 - night a8</strong>: On the
table are two briefcases. Each opened. One containing cocaine. The
other, cash. A pistol next to each.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Police! On the floor!</p>
<p><strong>b8 bedroom b8</strong>: Lowrey tackles the first dealer to
the floor. A LATINA girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a
hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered, Lowrey swings his
pistol up underneath the perp’s jaw and knocks him through the bathroom
door. Lowrey cuffs him to the sink. Meanwhile… Back to:</p>
<p><strong>8 living room 8</strong>: Burnett’s in trouble. He’s still
got his gun in hand. But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the
legs of a chair.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Lowrey!</p>
<p><strong>a9 ext. colony hotel - continuous action a9</strong>: Burnett
and the other dealer come crashing out onto the balcony, then over onto
an awning, rolling off onto some occupied cafe tables. Patrons scatter.
Uniformed cops move in to assist.</p>
<p><strong>9 lowrey 9</strong>: appears soon after, walking down the
hotel steps, leading the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his
jacket.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Nice backup.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. miami beach skyline - title sequence - night
10</strong>: As OPENING TITLES RUN and MUSIC POUNDS – we FLY OVER the
causeways, waterways and hotels that line the beach. Something is
happening in the balmy city as we CRUISE downtown and ZERO IN ON…</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. miami’s oldest police station - night 11</strong>:
The HELICOPTER ROARS low over the rooftops toward the causeway
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. police station - rooftop - fouchet - night
12</strong>: As the helicopter passes over, he appears from behind a
large exhaust port. Casper, Ferguson, and Noah behind him, all wearing
high-tech miner’s helmets with built-in radio headsets, and an array of
high-tech tools.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. air unit/shafts 13</strong>: Though it’s windy and
cramped in here, at least it’s cool. From a prone position, Fouchet puts
on his night vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly he
scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded onto the unit. TILT
DOWN to see the various ducts. Endless. Bottomless. But clearly,
Fouchet’s a man who knows his way.</p>
<p><strong>14 int. police station - series of shots - night 14</strong>:
Seemingly empty. From squad rooms to locker rooms to booking.</p>
<p><strong>15 int. evidence room - guard station 15</strong>: OFFICER
BILL O’FEE, 50s, reads a magazine and drinks coffee. Video monitors in
front of him show the different lockers inside the evidence room. We see
one room with stacks upon stacks of heroin.</p>
<p><strong>16 in air unit 16</strong>: The team, attached to cables,
slide into the building’s guts and disappear. STATIC CRACKLES:</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: We’re in. Start the video.</p>
<p><strong>17 ext. police station - alley - night 17</strong>: Kuni
finds the conduit he’s looking for, splices it, cuts into it with a
Makita battery-powered circular saw, then attaches a handheld high-8
video machine and starts the video feed. The unit is strapped to the
conduit.</p>
<p><strong>18 int. guard station - night 18</strong>: The MONITORS
FLUTTER, then STABILIZE. Turning the page, O’Fee sugars his coffee.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. trash chute room - night 19</strong>: An air vent
smashes to the floor. Two guys pull the metal case inside the room.</p>
<p><strong>20 int. evidence room - heroin locker - night 20</strong>:
BANG! Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to the floor. Their
headlights blazing, two men clamber into the cavernous room, Fouchet
along with Casper. This is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts
like butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred million
dollars in heroin. Each kilo brick is stamped with a distinctive octopus
logo.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Where’s Deputy Dog?</p>
<p><strong>ferguson</strong>: He made us.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Then do him, now!</p>
<p><strong>21 guard station 21</strong>: Sure enough. As O’Fee stands
from his desk –</p>
<p><strong>22 vent above 22</strong>: Where Ferguson is waiting with an
air-powered tranquil- izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that
strikes O’Fee at the base of the neck. O’Fee stops. But before he can
think to reach back at what hit him, his knees buckle and he drops to
the linoleum. Out cold.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. police station - quick shots - ferguson - night
23</strong>: One by one he moves backwards through the various levels of
locks, torching each to look as if they’d entered the evidence room from
inside the PD station. Meanwhile –</p>
<p><strong>24 trach chute room 24</strong>: Noah removes what looks like
a flattened bobsled with large urethane wheels from the metal case and
places it inside the air shaft. Ferguson attaches the black “scuba
tank,” labeled “NITROUS OXIDE,” to a valve. This is connected to a
metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the floor.</p>
<p><strong>25 heroin locker 25</strong>: Fouchet and Casper moving the
stacks of heroin, placing them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once
they’re done, we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con-
traption. A button is pushed – and the sled is pulled at breakneck speed
through the duct.</p>
<p><strong>26 ext. police station alley - night 26</strong>: Bag after
bag drops down the trash chute and tumbles into an open-roofed van where
the last of the gang, Eddie Dominguez, waits with the ENGINE
RUNNING.</p>
<p><strong>27 in air duct 27</strong>: The sled rockets by again –
WHOOSH – loaded with more bags.</p>
<p><strong>28 int. heroin locker 28</strong>: Casper and Fouchet throw
the last of their gear down the chute and ride the sled out.</p>
<p><strong>29 ext./int. van - police station - alley 29</strong>: One!
Two! Three! Four! They all land atop the bags. Eddie GUNS the VAN, which
rolls up the ramp and out the garage.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Haul ass!</p>
<p><strong>30 ext. police station - alley - night 30</strong>: On the
ledge the tape runs out and RECORDER EXPLODES. Pieces scatter.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. street - night 31</strong>: The van drives off into
the golden sunrise of Miami.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. luxury high-rise - morning 32</strong>: One of those
expensive condo buildings on Brickell Avenue with a circular driveway
and a uniformed doorman.</p>
<p><strong>33 int. condo - morning 33</strong>: CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH
expensive and trendy bachelor’s lair. State-of-the-art everything,
gorgeous artwork. Spectacular view. CAMERA STALLS ON – a perma-plaqued
newspaper clipping with a photo depiction of Lowrey and Burnett in front
of a giant pile of black heroin, thumbs up to the camera. The headline
reads: MIAMI PD RECORDS RECORD HEROIN BUST.</p>
<p><strong>reveal the latina</strong>: The one from the Colony Hotel. He
drops the sheet back over her head, reaches over to his nightstand and
grabs an industrial-sized bottle of Excedrin. Empty. He opens the
nightstand drawer, extracts another bottle. Empty.</p>
<p><strong>35 int. bathroom 35</strong>: All marble and brass. Lowrey
opens up his medicine cabinet. Locating a new bottle of aspirin… he
suddenly realizes that the SHOWER is RUNNING. Confused, he pulls open
the shower curtain slightly. From the back, it’s an incredible body,
then she turns around and it’s –</p>
<p><strong>the latina</strong>: Yes. The very same as the one he just
saw in bed. What?</p>
<p><strong>latina twin</strong>: ’Morning.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Oh man…</p>
<p><strong>36 int. burnett house - bedroom - morning 36</strong>:
Burnett and his young wife, THERESA, are jarred awake by the CLOCK RADIO
BLARING on the night stand. Theresa gropes for RADIO, shuts it OFF.
Burnett playfully gropes for her.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Marcus, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: We’re always saying we should spend more
quality time together. Well, I got the time… and you got the
quality…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I can remember when we used to do it every
morning.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: That was how we got a three bedroom house
filled with little Burnetts.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Been over a week since I’ve had some
quality time!</p>
<p><strong>37 int. burnett’s kitchen - morning 37</strong>: Pandemonium.
There’s the two-and-a-half-year-old, MEGAN, who’s taking bites of food
and spitting it back out, looking at it, then putting it back in.
Six-year- old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the
fridge. And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side- stepping his
eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on roller blades whizzing
through with a hockey stick and ball. He body-checks Jill against the
ice box.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Mom, Quincy pushed me.</p>
<p><strong>quincy</strong>: Uncle Mike showed me that move.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Quincy, never-you-mind. And take those
things off in the house! Jill, stop with the book and eat your
breakfast. Marcus, why do I always have to discipline the kids? You play
bad cop for a second.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Kids, knock it off… or your momma’s gonna
whoop your butts!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Ah, family life. Reminds me why I stay
single.</p>
<p><strong>jill &amp; quincy</strong>: Uncle Mike! Uncle Mike!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Hiya, kids. Mornin’, Theresa.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Don’t kiss me, Lowrey. I don’t know where
those lips were last night.</p>
<p><strong>quincy</strong>: Tell us some stories, Uncle Mike. You know,
the one about the stewardess?</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Don’t go tellin’ my son about your sleazy
sex life?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I promise, Theresa. I only tell your husband
about my sleazy sex life.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: I don’t want him knowing about it either!
Gives him ideas. Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of them do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You’re live with Lowrey. ‘Scuse me, Captain.
I think you mean to say, ’Get the fuck down here, please?’</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Not so fast. You were going to take the
kids to school today, remember, hon? I have a job interview…</p>
<p><strong>38 ext. burnett’s house - morning 38</strong>: Burnett’s
following Lowrey and the kids out his front door when his neighbor,
DICK, accosts him from across the hedge.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Hey, Marcus. Did you know we got busted into
again last night? When are you gonna do something about this?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta tell you?
I don’t work robbery. I’m in Narcotics.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Don’t get your sticky fingers all over my
windows… and keep your feet off the seats, I just had the leather
conditioned.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Marcus… I need you to stop at Save-More on
the way home and pick up exactly what’s on the list.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Oh, baby. Damn.</p>
<p><strong>a39 ext. miami p.d. - day a39</strong>: Lowrey and Burnett
pull up in Porsche.</p>
<p><strong>b39 int police station - hallway - day b39</strong>: Lowrey
and Burnett walking.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Twins?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: If I’m lyin’ I’m dyin’. Her sister came down
and posted the girl’s bail. And later? Man, talk about special
effects.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What special effects?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Tell you later – Mornin’, Francine. Where’s
the smile?</p>
<p><strong>39 continued: 39</strong>: FRANCINE, a civilian employee of
the narcotics unit. She’s got pictures of her children parked around her
computer desktop. And though dowdy would be a compliment, she’s usually
got a pleasant smile for the boys. Except today…</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: Evidence room. Howard’s waiting for
you.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Your kids are lookin’ sharp, Francine.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. evidence room - day 40</strong>: Burnett and Lowrey
know there’s big problems when, at the bottom of the stairwell, the
first thing they see is a yellow police tape and fingerprint team
dusting a torched lock. Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and
it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over the evidence
room.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Let’s see. There’s Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy,
Happy, Bashful… Now, who could we be missin’?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Could it be… Dopey?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: If it ain’t the leftovers from Miami Vice.
Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: And the women really go for that. Really,
they do.</p>
<p><strong>41 int. heroin locker - day 41</strong>: Another torched lock
noted as Burnett and Lowrey enter with Sanchez an Ruiz behind them. The
room is emptied. Captain HOWARD appears. He’s short, has a military
haircut, and has a minor Napoleon complex and a major in paranoia.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Nice of you to roll in. And nothing
particular is going on around here except, maybe, your dope is gone.
That’s right. The biggest dope bust in the history of this department up
and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of
yours if we don’t get the shit back.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: This can’t be happening.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: So here’s what we’re gonna do. Since it was
originally your case, you two guys are on point. Sanchez and Ruiz, you
back them up with whatever they need.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: So I guess we should start with the C.I.s
and the perps from the original case. But hell if I know any dope
dealers with the balls to pull this off. They’re either dead or in the
lock-up pending trial.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: How’s O’Fee?</p>
<p><strong>sinclair</strong>: Oh, he’ll be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Name’s Sinclair. Internal Affairs. He’s our
new proctologist.</p>
<p><strong>sinclair</strong>: You see, what’s got me confused is, why
risk leaving a witness? Why not kill O’Fee instead?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a
cop the whole department’ll get up his ass hard and fast.</p>
<p><strong>sinclair</strong>: And who knows that better than anybody
else? Cops.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You’re not sayin’ this was an inside job.
Cops wouldn’t pull this shit.</p>
<p><strong>sinclair</strong>: Not just cops. Narcotic cops. For example,
the S.N.D. You’ve got access. You’ve got wherewithall. And most
importantly, you’ve got the connections. Who else would know how to
unload a hundred million dollars worth of heroin?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off- the-rack
suit.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Enough. I.A.’s in it and there’s nothing we
can do about it. If any of this leaks, the shit’s gonna hit our biggest
fan. Remember him? The mayor? He created us and you can bet your jobs,
boys, he’ll rip us into little cop pieces. I figure we got seventy-two
hours to find the dope and keep our jobs.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Nothing like a little old-fashioned
incentive.</p>
<p><strong>close on burnett</strong>: He walks to the center of the room
and kneels to those four bolt holes in the floor. He fingers the
paraffin filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What about the air conditioning?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: So what about it?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I think you should go ahead, crawl up and
give it a good look.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: For one, it was your idea. Two, while my
suit’s fresh, you’re dressed for the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Don’t say nothin’ about my clothes. I paid
for these.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: And I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Not on a cop’s salary.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. heroin locker - inside shaft - burnett 42</strong>:
Burnett crawls up with some help from Lowrey below, stalling the
oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling through. The first thing
Burnett notices are the track marks from the bobsled cutting through a
coating of dust.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah. I got some weird track marks in
here.</p>
<p><strong>43 int. heroin locker room - on howard 43</strong>: Who
appears from below, framed in the vent shaft.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Nice and cool up there, Burnett? Comfy?
Maybe there’s a new career for you in building maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. squad room - day 44</strong>: Lowrey and Burnett with
their desks opposite each other. The CAMERA CIRCLES while they lay the
arm on some informants.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: There’s gonna be a lotta cash when the dope
hits the street. We want you to put the word out through your bank and
hustle the account. You help us, maybe we can see about getting those
R.T.C. auditors off your ass.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Listen, Cedras. You and I both know you’re
the number one importer for the Simona Brothers. And I’m tellin’ you
there’s a buttload of H on the move and someone’s gonna wanna stick
their dick in it. So it better not be yours. You hear something? You
call us. You hear nada? You better get the fuck outta town.</p>
<p><strong>45 int. unmarked car - day 45</strong>: Lowrey’s driving, no
seatbelt, doing his usual speed- weaving. Burnett’s hanging onto the
handle above the door.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Not a fucking lead. So now that we’ve done
the obvious, we need a shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Okay. So we talk to Max.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Huh uh. Not this time. I’m tired of you
working pussy into everything we do.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You got a better idea?</p>
<p><strong>a46 ext. congress gym - establishing - day a46</strong>:
Lowrey and Burnett arrive in the unmarked car.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. congress gym - day 46</strong>: Once-colorful stucco,
fading and crumbling. Scrappy Cuban fighters spar and work out on the
aging equipment while, at the same time, a remarkable amount of amazing-
looking women work out on weight bags, shadow box with trainers. Curves
and sweat, any way you look.</p>
<p><strong>close on max logan</strong>: she’s doing sit-ups on an
incline bench. She notices Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hi, Mike. You come to work-out?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Raincheck, darlin’. Gotta talk. Anyplace we
can go?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Equipment room. Hiya, Marcus. How’s your
wife?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>47 int. equipment room - day 47</strong>: This room isn’t
enclosed. It’s walled by wire mesh. Private enough, though. Max shuts
the door.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Sorry to come around only when I need
something.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Forget about it. I owe you the rest of my life,
Mike.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t be lookin’ at me like I’m getting all
sentimental.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Hey, I didn’t open my mouth. Listen, there’s
some major, major ill shit happening down at the P.D. Lotta heroin
involved. There’s gonna be a lotta cash involved, too. Gonna be some
happy motherfuckers around that wanna party.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So you want me to check around?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Just make a coupla calls. See what’s what.
Don’t be doin’ no wild shit. Just call me if you hear something.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. boxing gym - day 48</strong>: Burnett is surrounded
by beautiful, sweaty women. One of them is a fabulous BLACK WOMAN with
legs so long and toned, they’re not just legs, they’re weapons. Burnett
can’t help but stare.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: Who’s Max’s friend?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: A cop.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: Oooh. I love cops.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You know? I’m a cop. I shot somebody just
last week. Didn’t kill him, just shot him in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You know, that was really smooth. Think you
could do that again? Ohh. I’ll tell you, when the wife gets meaner, the
grass gets greener.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Green ain’t the color I was thinkin’ of.
More of a coco puff. Just real shiny, thick…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Damn! The woman’s got fuckin’ radar on my
ass. Sensed me lookin’ at another woman. Bet she wants me to pick up
Huggies ’stead of those baby Garanimals that they wear.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I don’t think anybody could be that
married.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. unmarked police car - in motion - day 50</strong>:
Burnett drives cautiously while both he and Lowrey bob to Ice-T’s “COP
KILLER.” They get a kick out of the song.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Miami’s the perfect town for you, Burnett.
You drive like a one- hundred-seven-year-old lady with her turn signal
on.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: And I plan on living to be old just like
‘em. Rubbin’ Ben Gay on my joints and everythin’.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You gonna let every old motherfucker pass
you? Or just the ones with big-ass trailers draggin’ behind?
A-c-c-el-er-ate.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I don’t have a death wish like you. I got a
family that counts on me. A mortgage to pay. And I’m not sayin’ it’s me,
but most of the guys in the station think you’re some rich kid playin’
cop.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: If somebody’s talking about me, I wanna
know… Man, I’m so sick of this. I don’t apologize for nothing I do. I
get up early and take it to the max every day. I’m always the first guy
through the door. And the last guy to leave a crime scene. So fuck ‘em
all. I could give a shit what those boot lickin’, brown-nosin’, ass
kissin’ motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I love you, man.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Oh, fuck you, Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Two-one? I got that address for you on
the air conditioning company. Oh, and Theresa called, she added
something to your grocer list: Muppets toothpaste. Bubble gum flavor.
She says Quincy doesn’t like mint.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the address.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Orona’s been working out of his house.
He’s at…</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. key biscayne estate - establishing - day 51</strong>:
Burnett and Lowrey step from their unmarked car and start up the steps
to this stony, estate-sized house.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: The air conditioning business has been good
to Orona.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Well, we can leave a note or we can break
and enter –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Wait. Hear that? I thought I heard Orona
beating his wife.</p>
<p><strong>52 int. estate - rear door 52</strong>: Lowrey kicks the door
in.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Uh oh. No alarm.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Aw, man. Did you cut one?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: No, man. Musta been you.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey and burnett</strong>: Dead guy.</p>
<p><strong>53 int. orona’s den - day 53</strong>: The door is unlocked
and swings open easily to reveal Lowrey and Burnett in an instant,
repulsed reaction to Orona’s body which sits upright in his office
chair, the body grotesque and bloated.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Where are the drugs? Where… are… the…
drugs? He ain’t sayin’ nothin’. He must be guilty of somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Whoa. Watch where you’re swinging them dead
arms, Orona. You’re gonna fuck up your own crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>53 continued: 53</strong>: Lowrey braves the body and
gingerly pokes around his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Watch what you touch. That’s evidence.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Not touching. Browsing… Mr. Orona. You’ve
got the right to remain silent. Anything you say’ll surprise the shit
out of us.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta bookies. Phone
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Lemme guess. Guy does the air conditioning
contract for the P.D. He’d have the plans.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: He trades the plans for his paper and gets
popped by the perps.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Works for me. Now can we go? I’m gonna
puke.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. lois field’s manor - sunset 55</strong>: As antique
as the exterior. Well-tended. Lots of potted ferns amongst rattan and
craftsman era furniture. Enter –</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Matronly, in her flowered dress and bare feet,
she carries a tea tray toward the kitchen. Max is following.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Please, Lois. Make some calls. That’s all. I’m
looking for a party with fresh cash.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m not doing any favors for Mike Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then call it a favor for me. Please?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Okay, then. I’ll make the calls. But you have
to talk to Julie.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll talk to her but she’s not into it.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: All you have to say is that she’ll be getting
paid for what she already does for free.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And she’ll say, ‘There’s one big difference. I
do it for fun. I don’t ever have to blow anyone I don’t like.’</p>
<p><strong>56 front door 56</strong>: It swings open to reveal JULIE
MOTT, 24, just as beautiful as Max and dressed to be undressed. She
drops one of those big, model’s shoulder bags to the floor and gazes
curiously back at Lois and Max. Her ears are burning.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay. So what’d I miss?</p>
<p><strong>a57 ext. biltmore hotel - magic hour a57</strong>: The hotel
bustles with activity. Cabs pull up. Doormen. Bellhops. Rich people.</p>
<p><strong>57 ext. biltmore hotel - courtyard - dusk 57</strong>: As Max
and Julie walk through…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: George?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Bad moods after a bad round of golf… I had
blonde hair, then.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What about Ronny?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Sex addict. Coke addict. Redhead.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You were a redhead?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Only for two days. It wasn’t even a
phase.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay. Mark.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oooh. Bad loser and bad, bad blonde. Farrah,
frosted kinda big bad blonde. Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But that’s my point. I remember my hair
phases more than I remember the men. So, a party in a Biltmore Hotel
suite? Yeah, that’ll really rock.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s a favor for a friend. If it sucks after a
half-hour, we’ll split and head to South Beach.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: A favor?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know, my friend Mike Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you just have
sex with the man and get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah, right. You’re in love.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s never gonna happen. I’m great at turning
lovers into friends. But turning friends into lovers, I can’t do.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, I don’t date cops. They never have
enough money and they’re always too tired to screw.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, I’ve told you before, my Mike isn’t like
that. If I were in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is the only person I’d
call.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. biltmore hotel - al capone’s suite - dusk
59</strong>: Upon arrival, the door is opened to Max and Julie by Eddie
Dominguez, instantly recognizeable from the heist. Eddie’s pouring
champagne into a glass.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Max, my little carina. It’s been a long time.
And who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Eddie. Julie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come on, Julie. Come in, Max. Welcome to the
Al Capone suite.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m not kidding. Capone had the place fixed
up with secret passages and hidden stairways. Can you dig it? People
were actually killed within these walls.</p>
<p><strong>close on julie</strong>: Not happy. Stuck at the Biltmore
with a Scarface wannabe. She looks over at Max. Let’s get outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Excuse me? I need to use the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped off the edge
of the earth and died. Either that or you moved to California.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So, Eddie. Looks like we’re way too early.
How’s about we come back later?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No. Don’t go yet. We can party. Just us
three. Look at what Eddie’s got to play with.</p>
<p><strong>60 int. bathroom - julie 60</strong>: Where she’s silently
cursing Max for getting her into this lame-ass party when she hears
MUFFLED VOICES outside the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through
the louvered shades.</p>
<p><strong>61 julie’s pov - through shades 61</strong>: She sees Eddie
opening the door to Fouchet. Casper and Noah follow him inside.</p>
<p><strong>62 int. al capone suite 62</strong>: Eddie is instantly
nervous in the presence of Fouchet.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Who’s the girl, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Just a hooker –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My name’s Max. I’m just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: I could use a friend who looks like you.
Turn around. Lemme get a good look.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. bathroom - julie 63</strong>: Instant horror. Julie
saw Max killed and retreats to the opposite side of the bathroom in
total fright.</p>
<p><strong>64 int. capone suite 64</strong>: Now, Fouchet swings the gun
onto Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: You’re a fucking idiot. Hookers talk. Now,
is that my dope?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Our dope… That was the deal, yeah? Right.
Until we got the money –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You fucker… fucker fucker fucker!!!</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: I have four more days until I make the
deal. When it’s done you get your money. Now, what part don’t you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, man. You need me.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: I don’t need anybody. I got three little
angels looking over my shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>reverse shot - eddie’s chair</strong>: Fouchet UNLOADS THREE
MORE SHOTS. BAM BAM BAM!!! Blood spatters onto Casper.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Aw, man. You got blood on my new suit.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Ever hear of dry cleaning? Now, shut the
fuck up, check for the rest of my dope.</p>
<p><strong>65 int. bathroom - julie 65</strong>: Half-panicked,
half-trying to keep her head. There’s no way out of the bathroom. All
she can do is switch off the light. And now she sees Casper’s shadow as
he approaches.</p>
<p><strong>close on doorknob</strong>: As it turns. Julie suddenly
reaches for it and pulls open the door with a surge. Casper stumbles in,
his face hitting the hard tile with a crunch.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip.
BULLETS are catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the suite.
Julie dives right into the secret door.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. secret passageway - same time 67</strong>: Dark.
Twisting. We MOVE WITH Julie as she races through it, heart in her
throat. She comes upon some old metal stairs, a sliver of light at the
top, and clambers up…</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. bell tower - night 68</strong>: High atop the
Biltmore, this is where the passageway leads out to. A door flies open
and Julie appears. Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies
by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie sprints as best
she can across the Spanish-tiled roof. Turns to see –</p>
<p><strong>69 ext. bell tower - night 69</strong>: Noah and Casper
appear in the Bell Tower. Noah scans the roof, takes aim and FIRES, but
he’s too far away – and Julie disappears behind a rise in the roof.</p>
<p><strong>70 ext. biltmore - rooftop - julie - night 70</strong>: She
steps towards the edge of the roof. Quickly peers over. A huge swimming
pool, five stories down.</p>
<p><strong>70 continued: 70</strong>: She weighs the options. Jump or
die.</p>
<p><strong>noah and casper</strong>: As they try running across the
harsh-tiled roof…</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Now look. My fuckin’ shoes. My fuckin’
Italian shoes!</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. biltmore pool - underwater - night 71</strong>: as
Julie breaks the surface with a huge splash. The water swirls as her
aching body struggles to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>72 ext. biltmore pool - surface - night 72</strong>: Julie
breaks water like a dolphin, gasping for breath. She’s dazed and
confused, but alive – for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. al capone suite - night 73</strong>: Fouchet reaches
down and picks up Max’s purse, then flicks it across the room to the
defeated pair of Casper and Noah.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: She’s a hooker. Find out who she works for.
Find out where she lives.</p>
<p><strong>74 ext. biltmore hotel - half-hour later 74</strong>: Several
police cars, an ambulance and a coroner’s van are now parked in front,
the lobby awash in strobing red and blue lights. CAMERA PANS PAST the
crime scene personnel to find Burnett and Lowrey pulling up to the
scene. They get out and thread their way through the growing chaos.</p>
<p><strong>75 int. biltmore - al capone suite - night 75</strong>: The
place is a mess. Homicide detectives are already on the scene, drawing
chalk circles around casings on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>75 continued: 75</strong>: On the far side of the commotion,
the two bodies have been photographed and are covered. Chief Howard is
conferring with a technician who’s dusting for prints.</p>
<p><strong>burnett and lowrey</strong>: enter. But Sanchez and Ruiz are
already on the scene.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You guys watch where you’re walking or you’ll
fuck up the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Looks like you’re already doing that.</p>
<p><strong>close on champagne glass</strong>: Which Julie left on the
fireplace mantel. Lowrey’s quick to note the two separate shades of
lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Two dead. A hood registered as Eddie
Dominguez and some Jane Doe. But the table over there’s covered in
high-grade dope. Sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I think we got us a witness. Over here I got
two different shades of lipstick on one champagne glass.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: He drops the sheet on Eddie’s body, then
moves over to Max’s. He doesn’t know it’s her until –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Jesus, no…</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Whatcha got?</p>
<p><strong>75 continued: 75</strong>: Burnett drops the sheet, turns and
puts a protective shoulder between Lowrey and the body.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: What? Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I shoulda told you to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>76 int. biltmore hotel - lobby - night 76</strong>: The
elevator doors open and out step Burnett and Lowrey into a lobby full of
cops. Lowrey goes straight to the front desk.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Eddie Dominguez. I want his phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>hotel clerk</strong>: You pay the bill you can see his phone
calls.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I’m sorry. Maybe I wasn’t polite enough.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I wouldn’t fuck with him right now.</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. biltmore hotel - night 77</strong>: Walking down the
steps toward their car, Lowrey passes the phone sheet off to
Burnett.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Three calls to Lois Fields. I’m going to
stop by her place and tell her a bedtime story. You can catch a ride
with Howard.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Uh oh… Alright, you check out Lois, then
check in –</p>
<p><strong>lois fields</strong>: I’m sorry, Jimmy. But you can’t have
her. Shelly only models and that’s all… That’s right. Like I always say,
some girls do, some girls don’t, and the rest you can’t afford – Hello?
Jimmy… Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. lois field’s manor - night 80</strong>: Lowrey parks
the Porsche.</p>
<p><strong>81 int. lois field’s manor - night 81</strong>: The door is
open and the deadbolt looks smashed with something heavy like a
sledgehammer. Lowrey pulls a radio with one hand and his pistol with the
other.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: This is twenty-one two. I’m gonna need
back-up at 614 Reach Road.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Did you check parole? How about F.B.I. or
D.E.A.? They’re supposed to be compliant with our requests? And where
the hell’s Lowrey?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Following this Lois Fields lead. I just
paged him.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: The madame? What’s it with this guy? It’s
always girls, girls, girls.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: No, Theresa… No, he wasn’t talking about
you.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. lois field’s manor - upstairs - night 83</strong>:
MOVING THROUGH the doors of the master suite where a light breeze blows
through balcony of sheer curtains, Lowrey turns ever-so-slowly with his
flashlight following a beat behind. The beam comes to rest on a
bludgeoned body laying on the bed amongst huge pillows and exotic
stuffed animals. The telephone cord is wrapped around her neck. Lowrey’s
closer inspection reveals –</p>
<p><strong>lois’s client book</strong>: Where an obvious page and photo
have been ripped out. Julie’s. Lowrey goes for the phone. Picks it up
with his handkerchief. No dial tone. So he drops the receiver and heads
out of the room. But just as he reaches the doorway – Suddenly –
Lowrey’s BEEPER SOUNDS. He jumps. Reaches down to switch it off when –
From out of those billowing curtains – Noah! Sledgehammer in hand, he
swings at Lowrey, who instinc- tively blocks and ducks as the hammer
misses and crushes the bannister railing. It gives under Lowrey’s
weight, who reaches over and traps the sledgehammer, only to find one of
Noah’s hammy fists battering him behind the ear until – The rail finally
gives way. Lowrey falls and crashes onto a Craftsman table covered in
antique picture frames. It collapses underneath him. Then –</p>
<p><strong>close on lowrey’s radio</strong>: Laying next to him. It
SQUAWKS LOUDLY…</p>
<p><strong>back-up cops</strong>: Pulling up now, twenty-one-two. Give
us your twenty in the residence… twenty-one-two. Do you copy.
Twenty-one-two…</p>
<p><strong>84 int. miami pd - squad room - night 84</strong>: Howard
can’t believe his ears. Is every cop’s wife such a pain in the…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Theresa, I know it was my idea. I know I
was the one who wanted a little quality time. It’s just that this can’t
wait. Can’t I just wake you up when I get home?</p>
<p><strong>84 continued: 84</strong>: Lowrey’s PHONE RINGS. But Howard’s
close so he picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: It’s about fuckin’ time. Howard here.</p>
<p><strong>85 int. julie’s apartment - julie 85</strong>: This small
place is a typical, party girl pit stop. Very little furniture, but
closets overflowing with clothes. Magazines, beer bottles, unmade bed.
Wet and frightened, Julie scurries around with a cordless phone at her
ear, locking all the doors and windows.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I need to talk to Detective Lowrey!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: He’s not here. How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You can get me Detective Lowrey!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: This isn’t another paternity case, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. It’s another murder case.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Did this happen at the Biltmore Hotel?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Listen! I just saw my best friend murdered.
I’m soaking wet. I’m alone, I’m scared and I’ll only talk to Mike
Lowrey!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Don’t hang up. Lemme find him. Page Lowrey.
Find out where he is!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Theresa. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>86 ext. lois field’s manor - night 86</strong>: Lowrey,
battered and barely conscious, is loaded into an ambulance. His BEEPER
SOUNDS.</p>
<p><strong>87 int. julie’s apartment - julie 87</strong>: She’s so
frustrated she’s about to hang up.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t want to come downtown! I don’t want
police protection! If you can’t gimme Detective Lowrey I’m just gonna
blow town!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Don’t leave town. Please, and don’t hang up.
I’ve got Lowrey right here. He just walked in. Be Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I can’t be Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Shut up and listen! She’ll only talk to
Lowrey. She says she’s our witness. That means she’s our only link to
the dope, not to mention my pension plan, so get on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yo, you are live with Lowrey… Yo, you’re
live with Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>89 ext. residential street - night 89</strong>: Burnett’s
Volvo turns onto the block. He pulls over on the opposite side of the
street and parks, his car blending in with others in the residential
neighborhood. He gets out, crosses to the lobby of her building.</p>
<p><strong>90 ext. julie’s apartment - night 90</strong>: Burnett knocks
on the door.</p>
<p><strong>90 continued: 90</strong>: He notices his gold wedding band,
hastily removes it. Just as he drops it into his jacket pocket –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Mike Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>91 int. julie’s apartment 91</strong>: She stands on the
other side of the door with a baseball bat, cocked and ready to fly.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: How do I know it’s Detective Lowrey?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: … ’Cuz I’m Mike Lowrey. I’m a cop. Wanna
see my badge?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yes! I wanna see it now! I’m not letting you
through the fucking door until I do. Hold it up to the peephole!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Anybody can get one of those.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey, lady. You called me, remember…? ‘On
the mike with Mike.’</p>
<p><strong>92 int. julie’s apartment - continuous action 92</strong>:
But as Burnett enters the house, all he notices are that two DOGS start
YAPPING HYSTERICALLY. He can’t see her. But she can see him. From behind
the door, she comes out swinging a bat. Burnett ducks and Julie smashes
the hat stand instead.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What the fuck was that for?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re not Mike Lowrey!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What do you mean I’m not Mike Lowrey? You
never even met him! Me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The way Max described you was different.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I’m undercover.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Okay. I’m way undercover.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Prove it!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I knew her from way back. From time to
time, you know… We’d get together. Mess around, you know?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It’s a man
thing.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You know what? You don’t wanna believe me?
That’s fine with me! Go it alone.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I saw it all… I watched him shoot her. Like
she was nothing. Please shut the door.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You don’t got any more golf clubs or bats,
do you? Nothin’ that you can swing at me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Then lemme introduce myself. I’m Mike
Lowrey. And I’m here to help you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re not what I expected.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah, well neither are you. You swing like
Barry Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Alright. Look here, I need to know if
you’ve called anybody. Or if you told anybody else where you are?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Good. You got a back door?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Where are we going? Duke!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Protective custody.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Whoa! Fuck that. I’ll only deal with you.
Otherwise, I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>kuh-boom!</strong>: A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the front door
open. Clutching the bag, Julie races around the living room.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Luke?! Where’s my other dog?!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Fuck the dog!</p>
<p><strong>burnett and julie</strong>: Racing through the apartment
toward the back door, Burnett wheels with the GUN and FIRES just as Kuni
rounds a corner with the SHOTGUN. The room ERUPTS with plaster spray and
NOISE. Julie shrieks, and Burnett shoves her through the back door, then
spins and FIRES. Kuni tumbles and dies from multiple hits.</p>
<p><strong>95 ext. julie’s back door - continuous action 95</strong>:
Julie leads him down a metal stairway. BULLETS RICOCHET left and
right.</p>
<p><strong>a96 ext. alley beside julie’s apartment - continuous action
a96</strong>: FOLLOW Burnett and Julie as they race through the grungy
alley to his station wagon –</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. outdoor cafe - continuous action 96</strong>: The
cafe is between Julie’s front door and the Volvo. Casper appears, FIRING
his GUN. People scatter and scream. BULLETS RIP all about.</p>
<p><strong>97 noah’s pov 97</strong>: The plates on Burnett’s Volvo.</p>
<p><strong>98 int. volvo - in motion 98</strong>: One DOG starts to
BARK.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Fine time to bark. Where were you when they
were comin’ up the walk? Shit. Bet they got a look at my license plates.
If you saw him again, would you remember the guy who shot Max?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: All I remember is one of them had really bad
hair. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I told you, I’m putting you into protective
custody…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No way. Listen, no offense, but I don’t trust
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah. I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Believe me, it’s not a new thing. Especially
when my life is at stake. I read the newspaper you know, people
disappear all the time.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Fine. So what do you want to do? Where will
you feel safe?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I didn’t really think about it. I guess it’s
your place or a plane ticket. Your place is cheaper. So you choose.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: My place? Okay, good. No, wait. My place is
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wrong?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I mean right. As in good. My place is good.
We’ll go there first. My place.</p>
<p><strong>99 ext. lowrey’s building - night 99</strong>: Burnett’s
Volvo pulls into the circular driveway of Oceanview Terrace.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>101 int. lobby - night 101</strong>: Burnett walks over to
CHET, the doorman, a shifty little guy who’s always got his hand out.
He’s sitting on a folding chair reading Penthouse Forum.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Detective Burnett… Mr. Lowrey is out…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: He told me I could use the place
tonight…</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Didn’t mention it to me.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Say. How’s that Mrs. Burnett?</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Your children good? Mr. Lowrey says you got a
regular baby factory goin’ over there.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Here. And if that’s not enough, I’m gonna
run you in for extortion.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Now that I think about it, Mr. Lowrey did
mention something about giving you the key.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. lowrey’s condo - night 102</strong>: The door opens,
Burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark for the light switch. Finally finds
it.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I forgot I had those switches moved.
Welcome to Casa del Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Nice… very nice. All this on a cop’s
salary?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I uh… I invest.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Right. What was your last pick? A horse in
the number two race at Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you an inside
tip.</p>
<p><strong>close on wine rack</strong>: Which Julie runs her hands
across labels. All French.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: – My father invests… Listen. You must be
tired –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ll ask you this only once, Mike. Are you on
the take? And if you say no and I discover you’re lying to me, I’ll
walk. Are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Fair enough. I’m not on the take.
Satisfied? Good. So… why don’t you make yourself at home? Here’s the
T.V. remote. Watch yourself some ‘Gilligan’s Island’ reruns or
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Heh – all these damn things look alike.
Well, gotta run… There’s probably a couple of good steaks in the fridge
for the dogs. Help yourself to whatever. I’ll check on you in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Uh, back to the P.D. I got paperwork back
on my desk to go through that’s about this high. And now there’s you, so
that makes it this high.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You mean, you’re going to leave me alone? In
your place. With all your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Why shouldn’t I? Are you a thief or a
vandal?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Of course not. And I’m not a call girl,
either.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I didn’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know you didn’t. I just thought you should
know.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Okay. Important lesson. Julie’s not a call
girl. Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Just one more thing.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thank you. For everything.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Aren’t you going to –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey’s machine</strong>: Hi. You’re live with Lowrey. Leave
it at the beep.</p>
<p><strong>yvette</strong>: Miiike… it’s Yvette… I know I told you I
don’t date cops. And I know I told you I wouldn’t sleep with a man I
wasn’t going to marry. But I’ve been thinking – and I remember when you
said thinking was a dangerous thing – so I started feeling… well,
lonely. Remember when you gave me that key –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: It’s uh… It’s uh…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You don’t have to explain.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Lock the door. Don’t open it for
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. lobby - night 103</strong>: As Burnett is racing
back through to the car, he sees Chet behind the desk and stops.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Listen, Chet. The girl? She’s a witness.
I’m gonna be gone for about an hour. Do me a favor. Keep your eye out,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: You know, Mr. Burnett. I’m getting off in just
a few minutes, so… I could watch the door if you like. You know. In a
chair. I could just sit in it. Outside the door like cops do when
they’re guarding shit.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Just keep an eye out.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you know? Just
didn’t work out. You know? Politics.</p>
<p><strong>104 int. burnett hallway 104</strong>: As Doris storms toward
her bedroom, Burnett trails her, apologetically –</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Don’t you ‘Honey Baby’ me –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: – I swear, baby, it’s nothing. I was on the
job –</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: And you just happened to lose your wedding
ring – ‘on the job?!’</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: No! No! I got it right here…</p>
<p><strong>104 continued: 104</strong>: He hastily fishes into his
jacket pocket, but too late – Doris slams the door in his face, LOCKS
it. OFF Burnett’s pained expression –</p>
<p><strong>105 int. miami pd - hallway - day 105</strong>: Burnett and
Lowrey on the move.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: If you were a real partner, instead of some
no-backup, hot doggin’, car chasin’, skirt sniffin’ motherfucker, I
would be gettin’ down to business with my wife instead of stuck in this
situation.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yeah. Thanks for the get-well card.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. police basketball gym 106</strong>: Howard is in
sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as his morning workout. Parked on
either side of the hoop, Lowrey and Burnett patiently retrieve each
missed ball and send it back to him.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Chief. I tried to set the girl up with a
sketch artist but she won’t. I tried to get her to come in and look at
the mug books and she won’t come in.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: She’ll only deal with Mike Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: That’s right. So let her deal with the real
Mike Lowrey! Who, I might add, shoulda been there to take the call
instead of runnin’ off like a hot dog without any backup.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Hey. I’m not the one who left a strange
hooker alone in my apartment. You know, she’s probably on the street
sellin’ all my shit as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I had to stash her somewhere! She’s scared
shitless… just like her dogs.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Dogs, too? I got Persian rugs, man. I’m
going home… explain the whole thing, take her to the Motel Six, she’ll
understand…</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Not a good idea. Until she I.D.s the
shotters, he’s Mike Lowrey. Could take a coupla hours. Could take all
day. You got a computer with a modem?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Big computer. Expensive –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yeah, I got a computer and you shouldn’t
touch it. It took me weeks to get it set up the way I want it and I
don’t want amateurs messing with it.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Burnett. I’ll have Francine give you the
user code for the computer files and you can run pictures for the girl
on Lowrey’s super duper computer.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: So what about me? I can’t tell my wife I’m
shacked up with a female witness! Besides, I think they made my car last
night… I gotta stay close to home, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Easy. Lowrey moves into your house. And
you’re on special assignment.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: No way! I’m not living in that zoo.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: My house ain’t no zoo!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Enough! You’re him, he’s you! Until she
makes the shooters and we get the dope back, I don’t care what you have
to do, just make it work!</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: You never had to go to Cleveland on police
business before.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Cleveland’s where they collared the dealer.
And that’s where I gotta go to testify.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: But what about us? The neighborhood’s had
all break-ins. I won’t feel safe if you’re –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Honey. I wouldn’t go if I didn’t have the
most trustworthy man I know to look after my family…</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Oh, no, Not Lowrey. Not in my house.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my life and,
I most certainly trust him with yours.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Why don’t they send him to Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Baby. It’s a Federal subpoena. I’m the
witness. I’m the one who has to testify. Case closed. I’m the one going
to Cleveland. Lowrey’s staying here.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. burnett house 108</strong>: Theresa stands at the
door with arms crossed. Meanwhile, Burnett throws his bag in the trunk
of the Porsche. He and Lowrey trade car keys, the Porsche for the
Volvo.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Don’t forget to put Snail Guard on my
lawn.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Just leave Cleveland the way you found
it.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Bye-bye, Theresa. Be good, kids.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Why’s he taking your car?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: He’s dropping it off at the mechanic on the
way to the airport. The engine needs an overhaul… or will by the time he
gets there.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Where you think you’re going? I got a list
here of things that Marcus was supposed –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: – that Marcus was supposed to do. That’s
right. Marcus. Not Mike. ’Cuz Mike’s a cop on a case with no time to
waste.</p>
<p><strong>109 omitted 109</strong>: &amp; &amp; 110 110</p>
<p><strong>111 ext. boatyard - establishing - day 111</strong>: One of
Miami’s famous canals, derelict ships are docked and rusting. One such
ship, an old freighter called the Mariana.</p>
<p><strong>112 int. freighter - lab - day 112</strong>: CAMERA FOLLOWS
Noah THROUGH a maze of tight corners and stairwells INTO a single,
massive hold converted into a drug-processing lab. Huge, bakery-sized
mixing BOWLS CHUG on one side of the room while lab workers form the
doughy, cut heroin into pizza-sized forms, and shovel them into tractor
ovens on the other side of the room. When the pies come out, more lab
assistants re-form the pies into keys.</p>
<p><strong>on fouchet</strong>: He’s dealing with his 26-year-old
chemist named ELLIOT.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot. Why are we
behind?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: The cutting agent is highly volatile. You
can’t cook it like you would a pizza. I had to gear the ovens down to
half-speed.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: We already accounted for that, Elliot. It’s
in our fucking timetable. So what else?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: There’s too much moisture down here. The
pies are taking longer to cook than we originally planned.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Yeah. It’s totally fucked.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: You. Shut up. Now, listen, you little
pussy. We’re not making pizza.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: We’re making money. I gave you a deadline.
If you succeed, you’re a millionaire. If you fail, you’re a fuckin’
corpse. And so help me God, Elliot. If you give me a fuckin’ ulcer, I’ll
dig up your dead mother and fuck her with your severed dick, do you
understand? Christ – Noah?! Bring me something for my stomach! A fuckin’
Snapple or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>114 int. lowrey’s condo - day 114</strong>: Burnett enters
and instantly those DOGS of hers are</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Shut up before I step on you… Julie?</p>
<p><strong>115 int. bathroom - continuous action 115</strong>: Julie’s
fresh from a shower, towel about her and drying her hair.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Julie!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That you, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah. It’s me. Mike.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: At least your timing’s good. Can you bring me
the lotion on the nightstand?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thanks. So I was thinking…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Crazy fuckin’ woman.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The guy who killed Max. Now, he was looking
for the heroin that Eddie stole from him… Max went to the party as a
favor to you. You’re a dope cop, right?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Special Narcotics Division.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: So this isn’t about Max’s death at all. It’s
about dope.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: We find the dope, we find our shooter,
too.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There’s some powder in there, too. Can you
hand that to me? Mike? Mike?</p>
<p><strong>116 int. bedroom closet 116</strong>: Burnett is going
through Lowrey’s extensive and meticu- lously coordinated wardrobe,
shaking his way all the way through.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Man, when this is over, I’m gonna get me
somethin’ better than quality time. It’s gonna be me’n Theresa on a boat
–</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Mike? I borrowed a T-shirt and some boxer
shorts until we can somehow get back over to my place to pick up some
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Mug shots. We got mug shots to look at.
’Scuse me, I gotta hook into the P.D. computer.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hey, Mike. Who’s the guy in all the
pictures?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: That guy? Well, that’s Marcus Burnett, my
partner.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: There’s the two of us, see? Me’n’… … My
partner.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Listen, Mike. I’ve known a lotta guys. And
I’ve seen a good number of their bedrooms, okay? But I’ve never seen… I
mean, look at it. It’s like a shrine to him.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah. Okay. Sure, I can see how it looks
that way… But you see… you see… It’s uh… a cop thing. That’s because
I’ve put a picture up there for every time Marcus has saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Saved your life?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I save his life. He saves mine. He’s got
the same thing in his house. Pictures of me. More, even. Good family
man, that Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay, but Mike. This is like a lot of
pictures. I mean, this isn’t something by the bedstand. This is a whole
wall… And I know Max said you were just friends. That’s why I was
thinking, maybe… you could be… gay.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Me? Gay? Are you outta your mind?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I didn’t mean to offend you.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: It’s a good thing that I’m secure in my
manhood to see that you don’t mean that. You know how many women I’ve
had in that waterbed? Check the waves as they go by. Count ’em. Now, mug
shots?</p>
<p><strong>118 int. lowrey’s condo - night 118</strong>: Burnett and
Julie are sitting at the computer looking at mug shots dialed in from
the police database. She fiddles with, but does not eat her salad, while
stealing sideways glances from the computer screen to the nasty, bologna
sandwich Burnett is eating.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: The shooter said four days until he makes
the deal. What else did he say?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Somethin’ weird. Sounded like three angels…
He wasn’t worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders
tellin’ him something. I didn’t get the rest. I’m getting tired of
looking at ugly people.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Just a few more and we can take another
break.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t wanna take a break. Then we’d have to
talk and I got nothing to say to a cannibal.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That was a living, breathing consciousness.
It felt joy. Sadness. Maybe it even had a name.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What had a name.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That flesh you’re shoveling into your
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: It’s just bologna.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It was alive. Some farmer fed it. Got it to
trust him. Then blew its brains out, dumped it in a cement mixer with a
ton of carcinogens and now you’re eating it.</p>
<p><strong>118 continued: 118</strong>: Burnett never looked at it that
way. He starts to put it down.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. At least finish it so I won’t have to
look at it. Let’s look at some more ugly people.</p>
<p><strong>angle - computer screen</strong>: It’s a photo of Noah along
with his extensive rap sheet.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wait. Hold it. Go back… That’s him! That’s
one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>120 int. burnett house - den - night 120</strong>: Lowrey is
on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Captain Howard, please. It’s Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Uncle Mike –</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: But I have to go now!</p>
<p><strong>121 int. bathroom - lowrey and megan 121</strong>: Lowrey is
standing just outside, portable phone in hand. He’s trying to keep his
voice low.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I just talked to Marcus. The girl just
I.D.’d one of the shooters –</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Uncle Mike!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Okay… Hang on, Cappy. This is Prudence and
she has to go potty. This is a potty. Everyone has to poop and when they
do they use the potty. Mommies poop. Daddies poop. Captain Howard poops.
Even doggies poop.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. lowrey’s condo - night 122</strong>: Burnett is
cleaning up dog shit from one of Lowrey’s Persian rugs. The stain won’t
come out. So Burnett tries a can that he’s grabbed. It foams. Julie
appears with a pile of clean laundry in hand.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Your dog took a shit.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: And you used Pledge to clean it up?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Lemon Pledge.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, that makes a big difference. You just
varnished that into the fabric. I’m sure it works great.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You cleaned my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I just threw them in with mine.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You cleaned my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What’s this??</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I had a little accident.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: This is my favorite shirt. My lucky
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Listen, Mike. I don’t have any of my clothes.
I wanna go back to my place to get some.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I need apparel. That and I need some food
that’s something more than a cold, slab of fear.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Slab of fear?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: All you got in the place are frozen
steaks.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Alright. I left my wallet at the office so
I’ll give you some cash tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>124 int. kids’ bedroom - night 124</strong>: Quincy and Jill
are rapt as Lowrey does a quick security sweep, checking closets and
window locks as he tells a bedtime story.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: … so your daddy and I are trapped in this
crack house in Little Havana. These dudes were real mean mothers… and
they start coming at us with knives… Now I’m scared, thinkin’ I’m out
for the count when in comes your daddy like a Miami hurricane –</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Standing in the doorway. Hands on her
hips.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Oh, hi, Theresa. Just tellin’ the kids about
–</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Thank you, but I’ll tuck the kids in. Say
good night to Uncle Mike.</p>
<p><strong>quincy</strong>: But we want to hear the rest of the
story…</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: G’night, gang.</p>
<p><strong>quincy and jill</strong>: G’night, Uncle Mike.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. living room - night 125</strong>: Lowrey is seated
on the couch, loading clips and dressing his weapon on the coffee table.
As he pours a Coke, Theresa appears at the bottom of the stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: If you were my husband, I’d poison
that.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: If you were my wife I’d drink it.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Twelve years I’m married, Michael. And I
never let Marcus bring his work home.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Just a harmless bedtime story. Thought the
kids deserved to know about the hero they have for a dad.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: We don’t need any violence in this
household and we certainly don’t need any more heroes. What we need is a
father and a husband.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Husband? Theresa. He’s your personal errand
boy. You beep the poor S.O.B. every hour on the Goddamn hour? And why is
it always about some useless bullshit that can wait until later. I mean,
the guy’s gotta job to do.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: You wanna know why I page him? Because
until that phone rings, I don’t know whether he’s dead or alive. And
lemme tell you. Those three minutes I’m waiting for him to call back?
Those are the hardest three minutes for a cop’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Touche, Theresa.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Sheets and pillows are in the hope chest.
I’ll see you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>a127 ext. burnett house - night a127</strong>: Noah’s car is
parked down the block.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. lowrey’s condo - night 128</strong>: The CAMERA
STARTS ON a beautiful SHOT of Julie sleeping in the bedroom, then PULLS
BACK AND SWIVELS to reveal Burnett on the couch. Gun laid across his
chest. He lays awake while Luke and Duke sniff at his feet.</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. police headquarters - day 129</strong>: Lowrey
unhappily pulls into the parking lot driving Burnett’s dilapidated
Volvo. Ruiz and Sanchez, walking from the cars, spot him and laugh as he
climbs out of the wreck.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Ooh, mean machine, Lowrey…</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You should recognize trunk. It’s the one you
came to America in.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You don’t come from Cuba by car, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>131 int. police station - hallway - day 131</strong>: Lowrey
and Burnett on a roll.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I’m tellin’ you, I’ve had it with this
witness. I wanna go home and get back to my life as it was. I got
married so I could stop lyin’.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Oh, please. Big fucking deal. You know what
I had to do? I drove your kids to school this morning. Your son forgot
his homework. So I had to drive him all the way back in that junker of
yours – What’s that you’re wearin’? Is that my new silk shirt? Is that
my shirt?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah. I know, it’s a little big on me. But
cool. I figure, what about it? If I’m gonna be Mike, might as well dress
like Mike! I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike. Swish.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Ugh. I gotta call the wife.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: The wife?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yeah, what’s up, baby. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay.
What else? You want me do what?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Mmm. Uh-huh. Hectic down here. I’ll be in,
nine. Nine-thirty. The kids alright? How’s that potty thing? Yeah? Okay.
Alright.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Say, why don’t you rent a movie or
somethin’? Uh-huh. You’re so silly.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: So, baby. What you wearin’?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Gimme that phone. Hello, Theresa?
Theresa!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Man, it’s off. It was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey, man. Don’t mess with me! That’s the
mother of my children. Don’t break up a happy home.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Marcus, this is crazy. We are five minutes
away from picking up this asshole and returning to our lives. And we’re
here doin’ this shit. Where the fuck is it?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey. Don’t ask me to find it for you.
You’re the expert on my wife.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You know, this is like some really bizarre
shit that you’re on right now. Your wife asked me to do this, and I’m
doin’ it. Besides, I’m you, remember?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You don’t even know where you’re going.
You’re in the wrong aisle.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You think you know what Theresa needs, man,
but I do this every month. Just look for ‘Fresh Days.’</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You’re unbalanced. Listen, I read the parole
jacket on this guy Noah. Armed robbery. Attempted murder. He’s a violent
offender somethin’ like nine times. Sweet guy. Not a single drug bust on
his sheet.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: So? He’s a new recruit. Keep looking, will
ya? ‘Fresh Days.’</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You know, it is a damn shame she makes you
buy this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey, this what husband’s do.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Terrible fuckin’ job. It’s like shaving
cream. They’re all the same. Fresh. Free. Confident. Secure. Super wide?
What the fuck? We’re takin’ this one.</p>
<p><strong>a132 continued: a132</strong>: Burnett snatches Lowrey’s box
and puts it back on the shelf.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey, man, look! You’re not even reading.
These are panty liners, okay?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: That’s a whole ’nother category of thing!
Man, for a guy that spends all his time chasing pussy, you sure don’t
know much about the woo woo. Here it is. Fresh Days. You pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>132 ext. grungy trailer park - day 132</strong>: Burnett and
Lowrey park and pop the trunk. Inside are guns and uniforms.</p>

Inspectors or Water and Power?</p>

<p><strong>133 ext. trailer - day 133</strong>: Approaching are Burnett
and Lowrey, but now they’re dressed in shorts and T-shirts with bright
orange vests and caps reading “Water and Power.” And as Lowrey knocks on
the door.</p>
<p><strong>close on heavy link chain</strong>: Wrapped around a pink
refrigerator. It moves.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What do you think the chain’s for?</p>

<p><strong>134 int. trailer - day 134</strong>: Lowrey and Burnett are

<p><strong>woman</strong>: But your uniforms say Water and Power!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: We’re undercover! Now, we’re lookin’ for the
owner of that animal.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Listen. The cat don’t belong to me. It belong
to my brother. And I don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: That’s too bad. Because his lion’s tied to
your trailer. So you gotta move the beast. Or move the trailer.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Move the trailer? Move it to where?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Everglades. Only part of South Florida
that’s zoned for Wild Kingdom shit. ’Course, the crocks down there’ll
probably eat your brother’s cat.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But he loves that lion! Raised him from a
little kitty!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Well, little kitty’s gonna be gator bait
’less you suddenly remember where your brother is.</p>

have you tell –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hi. I’m Julie. You must be Marcus. I
recognize you from all the photographs. Nice to meet you. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Very nice. The occasion?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He said we were going to a club tonight.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yes. We were going to a club. As in me and
my partner.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, that’s fuckin’ swell! And you call this
protective custody? I’m here all day. I’m alone and scared. And all I
got to protect me is Chet the doorman –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: What’s that on the rug? Looks like… a
stain?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It was my babies, Luke and Duke. They get
nervous in new surroundings. I offered to pay for the cleaning, but Mike
wouldn’t hear of it –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: And have you ever heard of a new invention
called the ‘coaster’?</p>
<p><strong>close on julie</strong>: She might be catching on here.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Marcus, you act like it’s your place.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: No. It’s not my place. My wife. She’s a
designer. She decorated the whole place at a discount just for Mike. And
when she hears about how he’s been taking care of – Off the couch!</p>
<p><strong>137 int. lowrey’s condo - living room 137</strong>: Where the
lock on the front door turns. The door opens. A mysterious WOMAN in an
overcoat, sunglasses and spiked heels enters.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mike?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m feeling really nasty right now.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I have a key. But, Mike…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Maybe you should call first next time.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yvette!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: You don’t quit stalking me, Yvette, I’m
gonna place your ass under arrest! – ’Bye!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: ’The hell’s going on out here??</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Just that crazy Yvette, stalking me
again.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yvette!? You didn’t just send away
Yvette?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: That woman’s into some weird shit.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: So, Mike. Any other spontaneous naked women
with keys, that we should know about?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club
Hell. We’re gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max’s
shooter. Anyone got a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I feel safer now.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You are ruining my life!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah, well this case is messin’ with mine,
too.</p>
<p><strong>a139 ext. club hell - night a139</strong>: The ultimate Miami
night scene. A long line of local and Hip and cool couples are waiting.
Lowrey and Burnett appear at the front of the line, coolly flashing
their badges to a hipster couple.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey, man. Got some bad news. Your car got
busted into. There’s some uniformed boys in the parking lot wanting to
ask you some questions.</p>
<p><strong>139 int. lowrey’s condo - night 139</strong>: Julie, still
dressed for the evening, paces back and forth. Frustrated, she rips the
tag from her dress, and sits back down at the computer. She plays with
the keyboard and Noah’s mug shot pops back into view. She stares at it a
little too intently. Images flash in front of her, the sights and sounds
of Max’s death replaying itself in her mind. Snapping out of it,
determined, she gathers her bag and exits.</p>
<p><strong>140 int. club hell - night 140</strong>: Hip. Hard rock.

yourself.</p>
<p><strong>143 ext. club hell valet - later 143</strong>: Julie pulls up
in Lowrey’s Porsche. Before the valet can get to the door, she’s opening

back at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Anything?</p>

believe it or not, the other side of the fishtank behind the bar.
Burnett’s at the urinal, blissfully relieving himself when Casper
appears at his side. There’s that awkward men-don’t-talk-at-the-urinal
moment until Burnett leans over…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Oh, man. Budweiser…</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Musta drank about a million Budweisers
tonight, waitin’ for my ol’ friend Noah to show. Wouldn’t know him,

his head, reaches for his gun. But Casper’s there, lunging into him and
lifting him up and into the fishtank.</p>
<p><strong>148 int. bar - lowrey 148</strong>: He’s been watching the
fish in the tank, but turns back toward the bar just at the moment of
Burnett’s impact. The tank cracks on the bathroom side and water begins
draining, unbeknownst to Lowrey.</p>

<p><strong>151 int. men’s room - burnett and casper 151</strong>:
Burnett’s gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea- weed on the floor.
Both Burnett and Casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall
– both reaching for the gun. Burnett’s there a second too late. Casper’s
got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and squeezes the trigger. But
nothing happens. Burnett in turn, grabs Casper’s ears and hammers the
big guy’s head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett picks
up his gun.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Next time, learn how to work the safety
with your punk ass. Now where’s my no good, no back-up partner?</p>

Julie halfway. He’s got her by the arm and is shouting over the loud
music.</p>

he said!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Well, whatever he said, you remember to tell
me later.</p>
<p><strong>split shots - noah and ferguson</strong>: Each moving through
the crowd toward Lowrey and Julie. Guns with silencers held tight to
their sides.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Three little angels! The guy who killed Max

and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah’s gun skitters into the crowd. Noah
chases for it, but can’t find it. But –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Don’t even think about it. Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: as she grabs Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s him!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: No shit!</p>

away from you. Especially not Marcus. You can take my word on that… As

a little bit horny, I guess. I think, maybe. It was the car chase. Or
the guns and everything. I’ve never shot a gun before. Maybe it’s the

Exhausted, he turns off light and closes his eyes. A beat. Burnett’s
face pops up furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass,
looking for evidence of adultery. He can’t see Lowrey asleep on the
couch. His head drops below the window frame, only to reappear in
another window. Seeing nothing, he moves on.</p>
<p><strong>190 ext. burnett house - night 190</strong>: Burnett skulks
into the side yard.</p>
<p><strong>191 ext. theresa’s bedroom window - burnett’s pov

houette against the curtain getting undressed.</p>
<p><strong>192 ext. side yard - burnett 192</strong>: He climbs the
trellis to second story; boosts himself onto ledge, inches along. Stops
to peer into a window when the ledge under his feet crumbles and…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: falls. Landing flat on his back on the
awning. His eyes close with a look that says “saved.” But then as he
moves. Something CREAKS.</p>
<p><strong>a193 omitted a193</strong>: thru thru</p>
<p><strong>193 int. theresa’s bedroom - night 193</strong>: Theresa
hears SOMETHING and runs to the door and calls out.</p>

<p><strong>theresa</strong>: I heard a noise… I think someone’s
outside…</p>
<p><strong>a194 ext. awning - burnett a194</strong>: Seemingly stuck,
once again, he attempts to move. Another, even LOUDER CREAK, then –</p>

and into the street.</p>
<p><strong>c194 int./ext. casper’s car - night c194</strong>: Casper and

<p><strong>194 ext. under awning - burnett - night 194</strong>: He
crawls to his feet and as he looks up at the damage he’s done –</p>
<p><strong>195 ext. theresa’s bedroom window - burnett’s pov
195</strong>: He sees Lowrey in his underwear and Theresa in her night-
gown as they part the curtains and look out.</p>
<p><strong>196 ext. side yard - burnett 196</strong>: In the bushes. He

leaps from the bushes onto Lowrey’s back.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey’s gun</strong>: Tumbles into the flower bed. Lowrey
reels with an elbow, dropping Burnett to the lawn. But Burnett rolls and
clips Lowrey’s legs. Lowrey falls. Crawls for his gun. Gets hold of it,
turns and is ready to fire when –</p>
<p><strong>car</strong>: drives past. The headlights, revealing
Burnett.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Marcus! What the fuck –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: … You doin’ Theresa? Theresa!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: What? Me and Theresa?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: I hope you used protection… ’cause I don’t
want a fourth kid that looks like you!</p>
<p><strong>199 continued: 199</strong>: Lowrey hauls back and belts him.
Burnett tears into Lowrey and the two roll around on the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>200 int. sedan - ferguson and casper 200</strong>: They can’t
believe their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ferguson</strong>: Wanna explain what this shit’s about?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: This whole deal has turned you stupid.
You’re seeing things that aren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: And I suppose this isn’t here? You were
going to put Snail Guard on the lawn, remember?</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Mike? Are you okay!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: I’m fine, Theresa! Will you get the hell out
of here before she sees you! You’re supposed to be in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah, I wouldn’t want to spoil your little
arrangement!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: And where’s Julie? You didn’t leave her
again.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: She’s in the car. Got her cuffed to the
steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Now, listen to me. Look over my right
shoulder. What do you see … I said look!</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Late model Ford. Two occupants.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Good. So who do you think’s in there? Ed
McMahon come to tell us we’re sweepstakes winners?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Okay. What are we doing about it?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: We’re doing nothing. I’ve got it handled. In
the meantime, you better get back to where you belong before I shoot you
myself.</p>
<p><strong>201 continued: 201</strong>: Lowrey holds and watches Burnett

On the front lawn. Satisfied grin on his face, he returns to the

<p><strong>205 ext. orange bowl stadium - night 205</strong>: The tow
truck wheels into the stadium and stops. Ferguson and Casper try to make
their break, but the scene suddenly ignites as the Orange Bowl lights go
on. Squad cars and about ten cops surround with guns and batons. Ruiz
and Sanchez step from the tow truck.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: This oughta teach you not to fuck with a cop’s
family.</p>
<p><strong>206 int. lowrey building - lobby - night 206</strong>:
Burnett enters with Julie in tow. He looks defeated, grass stains on his
clothes, mussed hair. And here comes Chet.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: ’Evening, Mr. Lowrey. May I have a word with
you? I was thinking that… maybe I could see your gun. See, we don’t
allow guns up in the apartments. Mr. Lowrey usually checks his, here, at
the desk with me… You want me to check yours?</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Oh, okay. It’s just an option.</p>
<p><strong>burnett and lowrey</strong>: enter. Just as file cabinets are
hand-trucked by them.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey. What’s goin’ on here?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Wait a minute. That’s my desk!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yeah, yeah. It’s exactly how it looks.
I.A.’s shutting us down. We’re all being reassigned until their
investigation is over. In here.</p>
<p><strong>howard’s office</strong>: Where Ruiz and Sanchez wait with
one of last night’s Henchmen. His face is horribly bruised.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: He says he wants his lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Yeah, but we told him we were desperate men
without no fuckin’ jobs, so… So?</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: Okay. All I know is his name. Foo-shay, I
think. Got this heavy French accent. The word was he offs drug dealers.
And there was quick cash for whoever had the balls enough to hook up
with him. I swear, man, watchin’ your house was my first gig for the
guy.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah. I guess you’re tellin’ the truth.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I also got the lab report from the stuff you
picked up in Noah’s trunk.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Insert substance… Highly volatile drying
agent? The greedy motherfucker! He’s cutting the dope.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah, but Julie told me his ship comes in
on Friday? You wanna tell me who can cut a hundred mil worth a dope in
five days? You’d need whole lotta time cards to make that kinda
date.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Or one really smart sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: We’re in the shit, boys. And there ain’t

miracle out of their ass.</p>
<p><strong>b207 ext. unmarked car outside tire emporium - day

<p><strong>208 int. tire emporium - bathroom - day 208</strong>: Now
Burnett has pushed Jojo up onto the sink. Lowrey hangs back, vibrating
with anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Hey, calm down. A little rap, that’s all.

it real fast, and real well. We’re lookin’ for a pro.</p>
<p><strong>jojo</strong>: I’m in the rubber business now.</p>

<p><strong>jojo</strong>: Okay, okay. I definitely don’t know for sure.
But I know a little for sure. Three guys… well, two guys and one of
them’s dead. Crazy rocket-scientist, Einstein fuckin’ guy. Got some rich

<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Man, it’s a good thing you got your memory
workin’. Cuz that dead man paperwork is a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>209 ext. upper class neighborhood - night 209</strong>:
Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey. Each is clearly
tired of the other. The silence is deadly until Julie breaks the
silence.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: So where’s the coffee and donuts?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I thought that was the usual menu when cops
were on stakeout. A little caffeine for the heart. Some sugar-coated
dough fried in day old grease.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Man. Will you get off this? You’re making me
sick.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, Marcus. All these hours on the
case, you must miss Theresa’s home cooking. Bet last night she fixed you
up something yummy and left it in the microwave for you.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yeah. Somethin’ yummy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I imagine there was something yummy waiting
for you when you finally made it to bed –</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Listen, lady –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Oh, man. It’s the fuckin’ pretend
police.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Be nice. After tomorrow we might need ’em
for a job reference.</p>
<p><strong>towne</strong>: Well, what do we have back here? Looks like
we got us two pimps and a hooker.</p>
<p><strong>de souza</strong>: Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does us both
we’ll let you leave with your pride intact.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Excuse me. One moment. Let’s fuck with these
bozos.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Now, where were we?</p>
<p><strong>towne</strong>: Outta the car. Hands where we can see ’em.
Feet spread.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Oh, that’s not how you frisk a potential
lawbreaker. You gotta start at the waistband. See if he’s carrying a
piece.</p>
<p><strong>towne</strong>: Gun!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Whoah. You better watch it, fellahs! You
know, it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and
a call girl… But it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and
their witness on a stakeout.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Now I’m reaching slowly for my shield… very
slowly… here it comes… just about got it… Ooh, look at that. It’s a
detective’s shield! All gold and shiny. A smart fellah wouldn’t fuck
with somebody who had one of these in his pocket. So… Let’s see. I guess
that makes us policemen. And you…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Not.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Now, some rent-a-cops have licenses to
carry weapons, where others do not. Which might you be? You wouldn’t
happen to have those permits handy, would you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Guess we know the answer to that one.</p>
<p><strong>210 ext. upper class neighborhood - night 210</strong>: De
Souza and Towne lay face down and cuffed on the pavement while the

Burnett’s house.</p>

Desi was first. Lucy second. Get it? Desi-Lu?</p>
<p><strong>213 int. lowrey and burnett’s car - dawn 213</strong>: Coral
Gables stakeout. Julie’s passed out and, once again, sleeping in the
rear of the car. In the glow of the faltering streetlights and the
approaching dawn, she couldn’t look more beautiful. And from his post in
the driver’s seat, he’s looking at her with a longing that goes well
beyond lust. Then Burnett breaks the silence.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Two o’clock. The red Civic.</p>
<p><strong>from stakeout car - dawn</strong>: Elliot shutting the door
to his little red Civic, jangling keys as he’s hurrying up the walk to

nap.</p>
<p><strong>216 ext. elliot’s house - morning 216</strong>: Elliot exits
the house in a hurry. Hair wet from a shower and fresh change of

<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wha…?</p>
<p><strong>218 ext. miami streets - morning 218</strong>: Tailing scene
as Lowrey and Burnett tail Elliot through morning traffic.</p>
<p><strong>morning</strong>: Elliot’s out of the car in a flash and
crawling aboard the ship. But as he disappears, Casper appears with his

<p><strong>burnett</strong>: They’ve made us. Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>222 int. lowrey and burnett’s car - en route - morning
222</strong>: Lowrey’s driving in his typical, pedal to the metal style
while Burnett talks on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Yeah. Tell Howard to assemble the troops.
We just made the dope lab. We’ll be at the P.D. in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: So what am I gonna do?</p>

Burnett at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>quincy</strong>: Hey, it’s Dad and Uncle Mike.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: In our continuing report on police
violence, the most recent incident involving two Miami P.D. officers
remains unexplained by department spokesmen. This high-speed chase was
captured two nights ago by our Live Copter 9 news team. And while the
driver was killed, both police officers involved in the incident seemed
to escape without injury.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Kids, you go over to the neighbors’ house.
I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Mommy’s going to Cleveland.</p>

<p><strong>226 int. lowrey’s condo - day 226</strong>: Julie is framed
in the bedroom doorway, somewhat sadly watching Burnett and Lowrey
scramble to get ready for the bust.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: So, I guess when you get back, it’s gonna be
over.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: That’s the plan… So, Mike. Loan some of
those ass kicking clothes.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Third drawer down. Hey, Julie. Do me a
favor and see who that is.</p>
<p><strong>227 int. condo - living room - day 227</strong>: Julie looks
through the peephole, then opens the door. And there’s Theresa. Julie’s
hip.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Which one do you want? The tall one or the
short one?</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Oh, I got plenty in me to kill ’em both.
But it’s the short one I’m gonna divorce.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thought so.</p>
<p><strong>228 int. condo - bedroom - day 228</strong>: Burnett’s
stripped to his pants and T-shirt. While Lowrey’s down to his white
boxer shorts. He’s talking and wiping down his gun with a rag.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Man, I can’t wait to see the look on
Howard’s face when we tell him… Holy shit! Hi, Theresa… honey.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Save your crap, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Mike what? What’d he do?</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Theresa. It’s not how it looks.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: It ain’t Cleveland, neither.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Where’s Julie?</p>
<p><strong>229 int. condo - living room - day 229</strong>: Where Julie
is gone! The front door is wide open.</p>
<p><strong>230 int. lowrey’s condo - elevators - day 230</strong>:
Julie’s inside. She hits the close door button. But Lowrey’s there to
catch it.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Julie. We wanted to tell you… I especially
wanted to tell you –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You think I didn’t know? God, you are so
stupid! And to think I let you use me like you did, Max. Why?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Julie –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wait. I know why. Because you said you needed
me. Jesus, who’s the stupid one now?</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: We still need you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: You stayed away from home just one night

orders!</p>
<p><strong>231 int. lowrey’s condo - lobby - day 231</strong>: The
elevator doors open and Julie makes for exit. She sees a cab parked

<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: enters, with Casper and Ferguson to either
side.</p>
<p><strong>231 continued: 231</strong>: They sweep into the lobby,
stalling just inside the doorway when they realize that their target is
right there in front of them, frozen like a deer caught in the
proberbial headlights. To the right and left, people at the mailboxes.
Chet on the phone behind the desk. But he’s looking at Julie. Then…</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Grab her.</p>
<p><strong>231 continued: 231</strong>: Burnett and Lowrey step out in
time to see Julie looking to them and the bad guys about to make their
move.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot from above</strong>: Fouchet and his henchmen LEFT.
Burnett and Lowrey to the RIGHT. And Julie in the MIDDLE. Fouchet is the
first one to draw down.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Julie! Drop now!</p>
<p><strong>people in lobby</strong>: Scream and duck for cover. Smoke
and plaster fill the air.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Pushes Theresa back into the elevator,
making her lay on the floor as BULLETS CUT above.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Slips behind a pillar as BULLETS WHIZ
past.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: On floor. In the middle. Crawling for cover
when –</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: With balls the size of Pennsylvania. Two
GUNS in hand, walks forward with barrels fixed and FIRING. Clips out on
one, tosses the gun aside, then, with his free hand, reaches down and
grabs Julie by the hair and lifts her until she stands.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>231 continued: 231</strong>: With a gun in her side, he backs
away and shoves her through the exit. Casper and Ferguson follow.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Swings around the pillar, gun leveled and

her.</p>

me… Do it!</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Marcus, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>233 ext. lowrey’s condo - day 233</strong>: Fouchet shoves
Julie into a waiting car. All three bad guys pile in and the CAR PEELS
RUBBER just as Lowrey makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn’t stop. He doesn’t
even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear, he appears from the
building, turns the corner out the door, launches into traffic like a
shot, spinning off bumpers, chasing Fouchet’s car on foot.</p>
<p><strong>a234 ext./int. fouchet’s car - day a234</strong>: Fouchet’s
car slides into the intersection and stalled traffic. To the right: a
footbridge. The car swings a hard right.</p>
<p><strong>234 ext. footbridge 234</strong>: Where a male nurse pushing
an old man in a wheelchair are in the way. SLAM! The nurse tumbles up
and into Fouchet’s windshield.</p>
<p><strong>wheelchair</strong>: Empty and spinning.</p>
<p><strong>235 ext. other end of footbridge 235</strong>: Metal pylons
imbedded in concrete.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Out of the car!</p>
<p><strong>236 ext. alley - lowrey 236</strong>: Turns the corner,
running up over car roofs and hoods. He lowers his gun and tries to draw
a bead on Fouchet and the gang. They’ve got Julie and now they’re
running.</p>
<p><strong>237 ext. alley - burnett 237</strong>: Appears behind Lowrey.
Lowrey waves him in another direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the
other.</p>
<p><strong>238 int. beauty salon - day 238</strong>: MUZAK. Old ladies
getting their hair blued and curled when – BANG! Fouchet and the gang
enter. Curlers fly. Screams!</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: enters. He dives to the floor as Casper
stops and FIRES. BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey
ends up under an old lady’s dress.</p>
<p><strong>239 ext. ocean blvd. 239</strong>: Exiting the beauty salon
and stumbling through a crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling
their way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments behind,
pushing his way through the same path.</p>
<p><strong>240 ext. intersection 240</strong>: Fouchet stops right in
the middle. Picks the first car that’s headed for him. Levels a GUN on a
taxi cab and FIRES two quick rounds – BAM BAM!! The driver of the car
instantly slumps. Ferguson’s seen this before. He’s around to the
driver’s side of the car, pulling the dead man out and leaving him on
the street. Casper and Fouchet shove Julie inside and they’re off
again.</p>
<p><strong>241 ext. intersection 241</strong>: But here comes Burnett.
Crossing traffic. He’s got no gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet’s car just
as it gets into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.</p>
<p><strong>242 inside cab 242</strong>: Ferguson aims his pistol upward.
He’s about to fire into the roof when Julie shoves him. GUNSHOTS RING
out sideways.</p>
<p><strong>243 ext./int. cab 243</strong>: BULLETS RIP to either side of
Burnett. Then Fouchet stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward
and onto the pavement.</p>
<p><strong>close on burnett</strong>: He rolls, makes it to one knee.
But his other leg gives way.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The
cab barrels at Burnett, who’s stuck in the middle of the boulevard,
about to become instant roadkill. Then –</p>
<p><strong>244 ext. street 244</strong>: From out of nowhere, here comes
Lowrey. Dashing out across the boulevard and snatching his partner from
the deadly grille of the cab.</p>
<p><strong>taxi cab</strong>: hauls on by. Leaving Burnett and Lowrey in
a heap of their own, both trying to catch their breath.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Don’t ever say I wasn’t there for you.</p>
<p><strong>245 ext. miami pd - motorpool - day 245</strong>: TAC teams
and uniform cops swarm around their cars. All waiting as Burnett and
Lowrey arrive in their unmarked car. Howard approaches.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: It’s about fuckin’ time.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: We lost the girl.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: But you found the dope, right? So let’s go
get it back.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Which one of you’s Lowrey? I got somethin’ for
him.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: At least I’m me again. I’m Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yeah. This is Lowrey.</p>
<p><strong>246 int. freighter - dope lab - day 246</strong>: While dope
is lifted and loaded from the open hold, Fouchet is revealed at the
other end of the cellular call.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: I have something for you to listen to.</p>
<p><strong>247 ext. miami pd - motorpool - lowrey 247</strong>: He jolts
at the sound of GUNFIRE.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: That bullet just killed the chemist. Now, I
have but four hours left to make my deal. Fuck with my timetable and the
next bullet kills the girl.</p>
<p><strong>249 ext. miami pd - motorpool - lowrey 249</strong>: He’s in
a vice. Duty or the girl. Then –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You twisted motherfucker… Jojo, you
sonofabitch. When I get my hands on you, I swear, I’m gonna kill you.
The snitch who tipped us to the dope lab? Turns out to be a bogus
address.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Bogus address?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: How’s this? I’ll kill the little prick for
you. That’s cuz you’re already dead. Okay, you guys. Put ’em back in the
lockers.</p>
<p><strong>249 continued: 249</strong>: En masse, all the cops act as if
the wind had been knocked from their sails.</p>
<p><strong>250 int. low-down bar - day 250</strong>: Empty, save for the
daytime regulars at the bar and Burnett and Lowrey in a rear booth.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: How’d he know we were gearing up to go?
It’s like he’s known all along where we’re gonna be and when.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: You know that once he sells the dope, he’s
gonna kill her just like he did Max.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Three little angels. Julie kept talking
about his three little angels.</p>
<p><strong>close on burnett’s wallet</strong>: Where out pops a picture
of his three children.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: If she dies, I’m done with it. The whole cop
thing.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Three little angels.</p>
<p><strong>251 int. squad room - day 251</strong>: Francine is at her
file desk. Looking pretty much the same as always. Same smile. Same easy
manner. Then the CAMERA REVOLVES AROUND her and SETTLES ON those
pictures on her desk. Her three little boys – including the one in
uniform. The CAMERA TILTS TO –</p>
<p><strong>lowrey and burnett</strong>: standing over her desk.</p>
<p><strong>251 continued: 251</strong>: Neither of them smiling.</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: Hey, fellahs. What’s the joke. Really. I
want to know.</p>
<p><strong>252 int. ladies’ room - day 252</strong>: Burnett holds the
door while Lowrey holds Francine. She’s broken, crying, and giving up
the ghost of her past.</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: It was a birthday party… You know, after
hours. Just the civilian staff… We were drinking. And everybody. They
all had boy friends or their husbands.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: So you were alone?</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: He was so nice to me. He said I was
beautiful, too. I guess I wanted to believe him… He took some horrible
pictures of me. I don’t remember any of it. I’d had too much to drink. I
wondered if he’d drugged me. Later… he threatened to show them to my
boys… my little angels. Said he’d pin the pictures up on the grade
school bulletin boards for all their classmates to see if I didn’t do
what he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: He wanted someone inside the P.D.?</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: At first, it was about drug busts. Dealers
under surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: He’d steal from them before we could make
the case. And then when the department gave the air conditioning to
Mr. Orona…</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Anything you can tell us about him?</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: What do you say about someone who rips off
drug dealers? A man like that ain’t scared of nobody. Not the police.
Not you guys. Nobody. He’s the scariest man I ever met.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Yeah. But does he still trust what you tell
him?</p>
<p><strong>253 ext. boatyard - day 253</strong>: Fouchet is supervising
the loading of the dope onto three canvas-backed, military-styled trucks
when his CELLULAR PHONE RINGS. He answers.</p>

<p><strong>254 int. howard’s office - day 254</strong>: Francine is on
the phone with Howard on another extension.</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: I have some more information for you,
Mr. Fouchet.</p>
<p><strong>255 ext. florida power plant - day 255</strong>: A Florida
Power van. Inside…</p>
<p><strong>256 int. electronics surveillance van - day 256</strong>:
Burnett and Lowrey wearing headsets, listening in on the conversation
between Fouchet and Francine.</p>
<p><strong>257 ext. boat yard - drug freighter - fouchet 257</strong>:
He’s surprised to hear from Francine.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Yes, Francine… What is it?</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: Miami P.D.’s called in the D.E.A. task
force. They know the deal’s going down in just two hours. So they’ve
deployed agents to every point of entry, airports, marinas, etc…</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>francine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: I’m very pleased, Francine. You’re the best
pet I’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>258 int. surveillance van 258</strong>: Back in the van
Lowrey turns to Sanchez.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Got him! Ma Bell says as long as he keeps
his cellular phone turned on, we can track him.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Call Howard. Tell him we’re gonna need
lotsa back-up.</p>
<p><strong>259 ext. helicopter shot pov - flying over dope convoy
259</strong>: Three trucks making their way through Miami.</p>
<p><strong>260 int. rear cabin of middle dope truck 260</strong>:
Ferguson is seated and staring across at Julie. Across his lap is a
shotgun. She may be bruised and abused. But she’s still got some
bite.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I forget the formula. Big gun, big dick?
No. Little gun, big dick? No. Big gun, little dick? Yeah. Yeah. I think
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>261 int. forward truck - fouchet 261</strong>: The CAMERA
ZEROES IN ON his cellular phone. The power light is green.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: They’re turning north onto the Orange
Highway.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: We can make better time if we cut across
the Biscayne Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>263 ext. biscayne bridge - day 263</strong>: The van cuts
across traffic, barely making the ramp which swirls up onto the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>264 ext. orange coast highway north - day 264</strong>: The
dope convoy rolls OVER the CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: As the convoy makes a right turn off the
highway onto an old tar and gravel track.</p>
<p><strong>airfield</strong>: The trucks roll toward an old airport
which consists of a small, pilot’s terminal and four or so hangars
spread out over the ten acre site.</p>
<p><strong>267 ext. hangar 3 - day 267</strong>: Two henchmen for the
buyer open the yawning doors of this massive, five-story hangar to
reveal a C-123 cargo aircraft. The convoy of trucks enters.</p>
<p><strong>268 ext. orange highway - day 268</strong>: The surveillance
van is parked at the side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>269 int. surveillance van - day 269</strong>: THROUGH a
floor-mounted SPOTTING SCOPE we see the last of the trucks roll into
Hangar 3 and two of the buyer’s henchmen shut the doors.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: That’s it. That’s where they’re making the
deal.</p>
<p><strong>270 ext. orange city airfield - scope’s pov 270</strong>:
PANNING LEFT AND RIGHT ACROSS the landscape of tall reeds and distant
buildings. Finally he STALLS ON a garbage truck and its four-man crew
rolling dumpsters.</p>
<p><strong>271 int. hangar 3 - day 271</strong>: Fouchet shakes hands
with the BUYER. Upon which time one forklift begins to drive pallets
full of cash from the open cargo door of the aircraft while another
drives pallets full of dope.</p>
<p><strong>buyer</strong>: Three hundred million and very, very fresh.
Too much to count, eh?</p>
<p><strong>on julie</strong>: As Casper pulls her from the rear of a
truck and handcuffs her to the door of a cab.</p>
<p><strong>buyer</strong>: Who’s the bimbo?</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Simply part of another transaction.</p>
<p><strong>271 continued: 271</strong>: The operation moves swiftly.
Dope pallets for cash pallets. Smooth, just like the original heist. Two
fuel trucks are moved in to gas up the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>272 ext. airfield - day 272</strong>: Rounding the corner
from Hangar 3 – here comes the garbage truck. CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS
Ruiz and Sanchez at the helm with both Lowrey and Burnett hanging from
the sides. All of them wear dirty white jumpsuits and protective
masks.</p>
<p><strong>274 ext. hangar 3 - garbage truck - day 274</strong>: It
veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters. With Sanchez keeping
a wary eye on the two bad guys and Ruiz to operate the hydraulics,
Burnett and Lowrey drop from the truck and do their best
working-for-the-city amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They
wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting forks where
the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and dumped into the truck.</p>
<p><strong>close on dumpster</strong>: As it lowers, the gearing seems
to get hung up. The hydraulics’ arms won’t work, leaving the dumpster
stuck in the air.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz and sanchez</strong>: Begin speaking Spanish, one
blaming the other for this fiasco. Angry words. Finally, Ruiz has had
enough. He tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off as if
he’s just quit his stinking job. He’s headed right for the henchmen, his
mouth moving and spewing and moving and spewing. The henchmen look to
each other, not knowing what to think. Ready for anything when –</p>
<p><strong>click click – guns cocking.</strong>: Both Burnett and Lowrey
are right behind the henchmen with guns at the base of their necks.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Mouths shut, feet moving. Now, walk.</p>
<p><strong>275 ext. hangar #3 - angle on dumpster 275</strong>: As it
lifts once again to the air, this time dumping the two henchmen into the
truck.</p>
<p><strong>angle - high above truck</strong>: As the human garbage is
deposited.</p>
<p><strong>276 int. hangar 3 - c-123 - day 276</strong>: The Buyer
buckles himself into the pilot’s seat of the C- 123. His crew shuts the
cargo hatches and he gives a pleased salute to Fouchet. The ENGINES TURN
OVER and the propellers move. Meanwhile –</p>
<p><strong>277 int. hangar 3 - truck engines 277</strong>: START. Loaded
with cash, they’re ready to go. Fouchet gives the signal to open the
doors.</p>
<p><strong>casper and ferguson</strong>: Move to open the doors. They
give a good shove. Still nothing. So they bang and shout.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Hey! Wake up out there! Open it up!</p>
<p><strong>278 ext. hangar 3 - day 278</strong>: One of the dumpsters is
parked in front of the doors. No exit.</p>
<p><strong>279 int. hangar 3 - day 279</strong>: Just as Casper and
Ferguson give a helpless look to Fouchet…</p>
<p><strong>280 int. hangar 3 - angle across hangar - day 280</strong>:
The garbage truck barrels through the rear wall, instantly colliding
with the left wing section of aircraft. The wheel assembly buckles and
the aircraft twists onto one wing. Fuel spills.</p>

and thrown across throttle. The</p>
<p><strong>282 int. hangar - one canvas-backed truck 282</strong>: The
tarpaulin rips and a pallet of cash busts open. Money swirls inside the
hangar.</p>
<p><strong>283 int./ext. c-123 - cargo doors 283</strong>: Open.
Henchmen ready to kill. Then –</p>
<p><strong>284 from empty dumpster 284</strong>: Pop up Burnett and
Lowrey. MP5-Ks in hand. They BLAZE the cargo doors and CUT DOWN the rest
of the Buyer’s henchmen.</p>
<p><strong>casper and ferguson</strong>: charge. GUNS BLASTING.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Move it or lose it!</p>
<p><strong>kuh-whoom!</strong>: The FUEL TANK on the aircraft EXPLODES.
The truck drivers dive for cover. Charging for the open hole in the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>285 int. aircraft 285</strong>: Inside the aircraft the
precious dope catches fire.</p>
<p><strong>286 int. hangar 3 - on casper and ferguson 286</strong>:
Looking through the flames. Shielding their eyes. Ruiz and Sanchez
appear from behind.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Remember us?</p>
<p><strong>287 int. hangar 3 - wide angle 287</strong>: One aircraft
ENGINE still ROARING. The money swirling and burning, falling from the
roof like a fiery rain. And –</p>
<p><strong>288 int. hangar 3 - lowrey and burnett 288</strong>: Easing
through the wreckage, ever-so-cautious.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Julie!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Michael!</p>
<p><strong>289 int. hangar 3 - fouchet 289</strong>: He’s handcuffed
himself to Julie, dragging her deeper and deeper into the hangar. The
smoke is getting thicker and swirling with the burning cash.</p>

between the two. They split wider. Moving toward those locked doors.</p>
<p><strong>291 int. hangar 3 - back on fouchet 291</strong>: At the
locked doors. He shoves against them in a futile rage. Julie begins to
choke on the fumes.</p>
<p><strong>292 int. hangar 3 - separate shots - burnett and lowrey
292</strong>: Each placing their faces against their own sleeves. The
smoke is thicker, swirling in waves.</p>
<p><strong>293 int. hangar - doors - fouchet 293</strong>: Shoving the
doors. Pushing and pushing. Then –</p>
<p><strong>294 from hail of smoke and burning cash 294</strong>: Appear
Lowrey and Burnett. Twenty yards apart and closing. Guns carefully
aimed. Fouchet pulls Julie close.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: I was going to fuck her, then kill her. Now
it looks like I’m only going to do the latter.</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Either we O.D. on the air or the whole place
blows. We’re dying anyway.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Let her go and you’ll walk. You can keep
the dope and the money. Just the girl and we all get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: What if I don’t have the key.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He threw it in the –</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Shut up! It’s gone. She’s dead. Unless you
move aside.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Pulls Julie closer. Gun at her head.
Looking to Burnett. While Lowrey is nodding to Julie. Nodding for her to
–</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Drop, Julie!</p>
<p><strong>295 hangar doors 295</strong>: Swing wide and way, way open.
Blinding light. NOISE. HELICOPTERS. And about fifty cops at the ready.
Rounds chambered. Rifles leveled.</p>
<p><strong>297 hangar 297</strong>: EXPLODES in such a concussion it
knocks all four of them to the dirt. The hangar crumbles.</p>
<p><strong>298 ext. hangar - close on burnett 298</strong>: As he looks
back on the conflagration.</p>
<p><strong>burnett</strong>: Sanchez and Ruiz…</p>
<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Don’t shoot!!! Hold your fire!!!</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: Twisting Julie for all to see. The cops’
rifle sights, all glinting in the sun.</p>
<p><strong>fouchet</strong>: I’ll kill the girl!!!</p>
<p><strong>298 continued: 298</strong>: Fouchet raises Julie’s hand high
in the air to show all of them the handcuffs when – KA-POW! – a SHOT
RINGS</p>
<p><strong>close on cuffs</strong>: The link is snapped in two by the
bullet. Julie falls to the ground. While –</p>
<p><strong>burnett and lowrey</strong>: UNLOAD their CLIPS in a
CRESCENDO of GUNFIRE. Fouchet crumples in a heap.</p>
<p><strong>299 ext. hangar - howard 299</strong>: The eye behind the
smoking sniper rifle. He reveals a pleasured smile.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Swish.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Investigate that, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>300 ext. hangar - julie 300</strong>: She finds her feet and
runs to Lowrey. Right into his arms. He holds her tight, but she winces
from a nasty cut on her shoulder.</p>

<p><strong>lowrey</strong>: Stick around. I’ll give you a bullet to
bite.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez and ruiz</strong>: They appear. Alive and well. Big

<p><strong>theresa</strong>: It’s quality time, Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>301 continued: 301</strong>: Burnett shuts the door ON the
