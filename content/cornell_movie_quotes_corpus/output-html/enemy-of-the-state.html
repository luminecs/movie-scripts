<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: “I know thy works and thy labour and how
thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say
they are apostles and hast found them to be liars”. Revelations II.</p>
<p><strong>hamersley</strong>: What the hell does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: It means who’s side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>hamersley</strong>: You didn’t ask me to meet you 30 miles
from my office for a Bible study class.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: It’s a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs
to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one
obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and–</p>
<p><strong>hamersley</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hamersley</strong>: I said fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Is that anyway to talk to an old school
chum?</p>
<p><strong>hamersley</strong>: You’re gonna finger me as soft on
terrorism? Terrorism, you unconscionable asshole?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: There are planes falling out of the sky,
buildings blowing up. American buildings. Americans getting bombs in the
mail. What are we gonna do!?</p>
<p><strong>hamersley</strong>: We’re not gonna hand you and your band of
lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I’m not gonna sit in Congress and
write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at
anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something
to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else.
Now get outa my car, I’ve got a committee meeting on the hill.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Senator Albert’s office–</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: I don’t know how much longer we can hold
out, Mr. Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know, either, L.T. Maybe you guys
should get yourself a labor lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>l.t.</strong>: Well that’s why I’m here, Mr. Dean. ’Cause
you’re a labor lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>l.t.</strong>: Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel
Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti
’cause it’s his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido
mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: L.T., in this office I’d prefer you say
Italian-Americans.</p>
<p><strong>l.t.</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry’s in St. Lukes
now, so I’m a little–I’m not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take
Bellmoth’s offer, it’ll only get worse.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s because your Union bosses are those
Guido mother-fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>l.t.</strong>: I don’t under–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: The Union’s trying to railroad you into
accepting terms worse than what you have now.</p>
<p><strong>l.t.</strong>: Why would the Union–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Because they’ve been paid off by Bellmoth.</p>
<p><strong>l.t.</strong>: Mr. Dean–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My name’s Bobby. I’m your lawyer. Don’t do
anything ’till I talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Martha!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Larry Spinks, St. Lukes. Send him a case of
chianti from the firm. And send his wife Rosalie some flowers.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How’s the trout?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It tastes like fish.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It is fish.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I mean it tastes like every other fish I’ve
ever had. Every fish tastes the same.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Do you like fish?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Not that much.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Here’s what you asked for. Brill’s note said
it was everything you’d need to, shall we say, coax DePinto–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: When do I get to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: DePinto?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Brill.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That wasn’t the answer I was hoping for.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What answer were you–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: “Soon”. Or at least sooner than never.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s how he works.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Brill?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: So you’ve said.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Ten thousand cash. I don’t know if it’s
Brill’s prices going up or your commission.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I take a straight 15 percent. Brill’s fee
varies with risk. Perhaps you’d be more comfortable using someone
else.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Other than Brill.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Other than me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why would I–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Someone with whom you don’t have quite so
personal a–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I like our history. And I like you. I’d
probably like Brill if I ever got to–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I just want to make sure I’m not breaking the
law.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: How can I be sure.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I wouldn’t let you. Good luck with
DePinto.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Eat your fish.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Mr. DePinto? My name’s Robert Dean. I’m an
attorney with Seth, Silverberg.</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office
to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and
co-workers.</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: Is this a fuckin’ joke?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t believe it is, no.</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: Why the hell would I–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ve got photographs of you at the Trenton
Ramada looking very–</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: That ain’t me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s not?</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: You don’t know who the fuck–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s not you having a whiskey sour with
Carmine Morada.</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: This is fucked. You don’t know who’s in
that–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped
the gun.</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: You’re goddam right you jumped the gun.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s probably not you in the picture. I tell
you what, I’ll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they
can’t–</p>
<p><strong>depinto</strong>: I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you’re talking
to one.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Alright, alright already, I see you.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz pov</strong>: Wreckage surrounded by squad cars,
ambulances and media circus. Something’s happened. Something big.</p>
<p><strong>tv newscaster</strong>: Police are labeling it an accident
but promise a full investigation.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Don Hamersley, senior GOP congressional
leader, was serving as a negotiator on the House/Senate sub-committee
studying the Anti- Terror Bill…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …the controversial legislation that
would give various law enforcement agencies expanded authority in the
fight against terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Known as the Voice of Caution, Hamersley
was an outspoken advocate of…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Sixty-eight years old, Hamersley leaves
behind a wife and four children.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Tell him it’s Zavitz. I need to speak to
him. Tell him it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: Zavitz, what? You want your old job
back?</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Listen to me–</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: Tired of chasing squirrels around the
park?</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Listen–</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: Lemme ask you something. I put a bird
feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking–</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Turn on CNN.</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: They keep taking the bird seed. I thought
since you’re the expert on–</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on
CNN!</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: Alright, I made a joke about squirrels,
don’t get so–</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Once again, police at this point are
calling Hamersley’s death an accident…</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: I was doing motion-activated taping up in
Shenandoah. That’s where Hamersley had his accident. He wasn’t alone. He
met someone. They argued.</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: You’ve got it on tape?</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Clear as day.</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: Who else have you told?</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: No one. But I’m a little nervous.</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: When can you get it here?</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: I’m doing a transfer now.</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: Come straight here. Don’t talk to
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: I’ll come straight there.</p>
<p><strong>alfonso</strong>: Be careful, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kent island research facility</strong>: Prohibited Area. No
Photos or Sketches.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Someone had automated cameras in the
park. A nature photographer.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: How’re we with pre-trials.
Ms. Saunders.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: I’m expecting a favorable ruling this
afternoon on the evidenciary motion, but I could use some more manpower
with the interrogatories.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Mr. Dean, would you care to give
Ms. Saunders a hand with the interrogatories.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous
engagement this evening.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: And may I ask what could possibly be
more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I have to go lingerie shopping.</p>
<p><strong>stilwell</strong>: Lingerie shopping?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: A Christmas present for my wife.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Go to Harrison’s. They’ve got models
that’ll try the garments on for you.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Bobby, this is a 40 million dollar client.
I really need some help tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Diane, maybe you didn’t hear Mr. Silverberg.
They’ve got models that’ll try on the garments. Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Merry Christmas, son.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Federal Express for ‘Zavitz’.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Federal Express?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a
signature.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: How’d you get in the building?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: The door was open, sir. I just need a
signature.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz pov</strong>: A fish-eye view of a Fed-Ex man, JONES,
looking bored.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Can you tell me who it’s from?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Micro-Tel Electronics. Sunland.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Can you–would it be possible to leave it by
the door?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Not without a signature.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: All right. Okay. Just give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz pov</strong>: TWO DWP INSTALLERS hovering in a bucket
across the street. Down below, a cargo van with a multiple roof antenna
is double parked near a Fed-Ex van. Then–</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Go to three. Go to three. Package is
out the window.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: 305 to 308. We’ve got the eyeball.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: We’ll take delivery from here.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hm?!</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: Do you see anything you like?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m married.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m married to my wife…of several years…and
I’d like to buy…as a Christmas present…</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: You’d like to buy your wife some
lingerie as a Christmas gift.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yes. I have her permission.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: It’s okay. I think it’s a wonderful
gift.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: How ’bout Christian Dior?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Is that good?</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know anything about this. Well, I
mean, I know a little about–from a certain perspective. My point is, I
don’t want to do anything foolish.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: It’s a little late for that.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: What size?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: What size?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Eight. Size eight.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: Remain calm.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s me, Robert Dean. From Seth, Silverberg. I
worked on–</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Bobby–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s been a few years.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m just doing some Christmas shopping. It’s
for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn’t the main present, it’s just,
you know, a little–</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: I need help.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: How can I reach you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>zavitz</strong>: Are you still in Crystal City?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: I think she’ll like this very much.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: For that matter, I think you will
too.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Could you give me just a moment to talk to a
friend of mine here? Not about this, but…Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: A guy got hit by a bus.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Ah, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Ah…Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year
old boy, good looking, about yea-big.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hi, dad.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Hi, Mr. Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hello. Hello, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>nanny</strong>: Hello, Mr. Dean.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We can’t get to the fourth level. We keep
getting vaporized by the Black Knight.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re learning a cruel lesson.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Are those my Christmas presents?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Some of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Can I open ’em up?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Sure, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: In your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You staying for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Is it okay?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You got any money?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He’s kidding.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Where’s mom?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: She’s in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>senator tasken</strong>: Laws service society and they need
to be flexible to meet changing demands. We’ve got to be able to deal
with a terrorist threat before it occurs.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: This guy’s a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Listen to him.</p>
<p><strong>senator tasken</strong>: This is no longer a theoretical
problem, it’s a reality. Turn on the news. Bombings, hostages–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He’s got a point.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Not a very good one, but–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So you tap everyone’s phone? You use
computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Just for the criminals.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We won’t suspend the civil rights of the good
people.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You should take this seriously.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I think you’re taking it seriously enough for
both of us.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You’re a lawyer. Don’t you care what’s going
on around you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Something bad happened tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I saw a man die.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: In front of Harrison’s, he got hit by a bus. I
knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few
years back.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like
he wanted to tell me… …he was upset about something and he said… Doesn’t
matter now. I’m gonna wash up.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What’d you buy at Harrison’s?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner.
You’re spookin’ the kids.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: “Do thou, O Lord, protect us–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: –guard us ever from this generation. On
every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the sons of
men.” Psalms 12.7 and 12.8. Tell me what this means, Mr. O’Brian.</p>
<p><strong>o’brian</strong>: It means–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: He’s dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What about the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We found the originals.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: The originals?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: There was a transfer.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Am I to understand–</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: He never made it to the newspaper, but there
was private sector contact.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Several indiscriminates and one primary who
we’ve ID’d as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney. Mr. Reynolds?
Sir?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the
threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and
anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to
own him. I need to own him now.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Diane’s instinct is that it’s sabre rattling.
I think they’re gonna file suit.</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: We’ve checked everything. NRO tapes,
traffic surveillance monitors -</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: - and two ATM cameras. The one showing
promise, though, is this security camera from the department store.
Freeze there.</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: Times ten.</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: Focus on the drop.</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: Enhance, then forward, frame by frame…</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: Just before the view’s blocked, Zavitz
reaches in his jacket for something. When the view returns, there’s a
shape change in Dean’s bag. See the shadow variance? We reverse imaged
it–</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: Something’s definitely been added. It’s not
a video cassette, the shadow’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What’s your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: It’s hard to say for certain, these things
are–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: I’m not asking you to say for certain.
This is what you’re trained to do, right?</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Then what’s your goddam opinion?</p>
<p><strong>fiedler</strong>: Zavitz had digital compression equipment.
He could’ve downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small
enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he
dropped it in that bag.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We’d have to–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: How’d you get the information on DePinto?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Who did you work with to get the–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah, but you said you’ve never met him. How
did you–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Honey, I don’t like to talk about this stuff
in front of Eric.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Have you been working with Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh my God -</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: This is Robert Dean at 3325 Sutton Place. I
want to report a break-in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: They took the espresso machine. The espresso
machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably
wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Did they take your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’ve got a bunch of Armani suits, they
didn’t take ’em?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Usually they take clothes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why don’t you give ’em a call.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What about jewelry?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: They didn’t take the jewelry. They took the
computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The blender?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I love my blender.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They didn’t take the silverware?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, but they took my blender.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Sounds like they didn’t want anything that
wasn’t electric?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They only took electrical appliances.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Serve the ball.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Robert Dean?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: I didn’t want to bother you during your
racquetball game.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Thanks. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: I’m sorry. Detective Morelos.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey, did you guys find my stuff?</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: The robbery.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: No, sir, I’m not involved with that. I’m
doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago.
Your name keeps coming up.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh…yeah, I didn’t see the accident.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Witnesses said you were there, but I notice
you didn’t file a report.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: A report?</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: A police report.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s ’cause I wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: You weren’t at Harrison’s Department Store
the night before–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I was in the store, the accident was outside.
It was a bus.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before
he died. I thought you might know something.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: About the accident.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m no expert, but I’m assuming that the
impact of a moving bus against his body caused–</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What kind of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Are you invoking attorney/client
privilege.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m not his attorney.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Than why can’t you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Because I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: I’m just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz
was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Than why don’t you talk to the bus driver?</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Somebody took my blender.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: We’d appreciate your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m happy to help you all I can. But I didn’t
see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I’ve gotta go to
work.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Did he give you anything?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Was he with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Not that I could see.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Nobody gave you anything?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Why’d you go to Harrison’s?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: To buy lingerie.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: For your wife?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yes, for my wife, what the hell kinds of
questions are these.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: I thought maybe it might be for Rachel
Banks.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know what’s goin’ on with Zavitz, but
that was way, way outa line. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>morelos</strong>: 403 to 401. He’s coming up.</p>
<p><strong>peers</strong>: ’Morning, Mr. Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey. Would you get me what I need for
Zwernickii and the Bellmoth motions.</p>
<p><strong>peers</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: And do me a favor. Find out what you can about
Daniel Zavitz. We did some work for him a few years back and there
should be a file.</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: 402 to 401. Doorstep’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: 402, this is 401. Password’s “Puccini.”</p>
<p><strong>levin</strong>: Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from
someone wanting information on you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: The police?</p>
<p><strong>levin</strong>: No. He said they were doing a credit check.
Are you refinancing a loan?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You remember Daniel Zavitz?</p>
<p><strong>levin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He got hit by a bus.</p>
<p><strong>levin</strong>: What does that have to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I honestly don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>levin</strong>: Was Zavitz in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>levin</strong>: You think there was a connection to–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Jesus! I just told you. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: Mr. Dean?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: We’d like to ask you some questions about
Daniel Zavitz.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Who are you people?</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: I’m an investigator with Pro-Tech
Security.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I went through this with an investigator this
morning. If I could–</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion
scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your
knowledge, and we need to–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: We believe he did.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: We have good reason to believe that he passed
you–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: If he passed me materials, I’d have them. I
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: We’d like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz
may have given you–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He didn’t give me–</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: –otherwise we may have to–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Otherwise you may have to what?</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: We’d rather not–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Fuck you. You may have to what?</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: We may have to explore additional
avenues.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He didn’t give me–</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: –otherwise we may have to–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Otherwise you may have to what?</p>
<p><strong>pratt</strong>: We’d rather not–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Fuck you. You may have to–</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: He’s arrogant and threatening. Voice stress
points suggest he’s worrying.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Hiding something?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: It was in his bag. Now it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Destroy his credibility before he goes
public. Neutralize him. I don’t want anyone listening to a word he has
to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Can I talk to you a second?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Table 122?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That’s what I want to talk to you about?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You
guys didn’t have a table that was in the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The Congressman’s very happy to have your
support, but he’s heard that there’s an investigation.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: An investigation? It was a bus accident.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He’s heard that it’s escalated.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Into what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there
might be mob ties.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m a labor lawyer. There are always mob
ties.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just be cool.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I don’t understand why Jerry couldn’t clear
this up.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, you know–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: He’s got his priorities?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: There’s just, clearly, some administrative
snafu. I’m sure this is the worst of it.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Mr. Dean?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s Rachel Banks.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I got a call from my firm this morning
saying don’t come in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There are reporters wanting to know about my
relationship with you and how long I’ve worked for the mob. The mob,
Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: All right, look–</p>
<p><strong>peers</strong>: Blake and Silverberg want you in the
conference room.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Listen–</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: I got a call this morning from a source
I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your
involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t under–</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: We’ve also been informed that the Grand Jury
is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics
violations.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: They claim you helped create a shell
company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing
relationship, the Gambino family’s been able to exert influence and
provide false witnesses to discredit our case.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh, well, that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Except for the part about my setting up a
company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any
relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Robert–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and
I’ll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Tell us about Rachel Banks.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Rachel Banks?</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: The attorney?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Have you two been having an affair?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What kind of a question is that?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: A direct one.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I have a professional relationship with Rachel
Banks. She’s the go- between for a private investigator I use.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Brill.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Why don’t you just call Brill directly.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: I’m told you had an affair with Rachel Banks
four years ago.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Told by whom?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Considering the enormous exposure to which
you’ve subjected this firm, I’d think you’d do best to simply answer my
questions.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well considering what a colossal douche bag
you are, David, maybe I’d do best to simply kick your ass all over the
capitol.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Gentlemen–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: This is bullshit. Someone’s mixing up a bunch
of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Who would do that?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Well until we find, you’re gonna have to
take a leave of absence.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re firing me.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: A leave of absence. Until we’ve sorted
this all out.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my
name.</p>
<p><strong>silverberg</strong>: Bobby–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Robert–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Where’s Stacy?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: She doesn’t want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What are you talking–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: She can’t talk to you right now.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Because she’s reading the newspaper, you
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: How could you let me find out like this?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy, I found out like this. This is the
first I’m hearing of–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Robert–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: “Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a
possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of
dollars–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: “At the center of the investigation are
well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks.”</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah…look–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You swore!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She’s
my connection to an investigator.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I told you I didn’t want you seeing her.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we
went to a fucking counselor for a year.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I see her for business.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You told me you weren’t seeing her at
all.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I didn’t want you to be upset. I shouldn’t
have lied. Stacy, there’s nothing between me and Rachel Banks.</p>
<p><strong>dean’s pov</strong>: A black and white surveillance photo of
DEAN and RACHEL on a hotel balcony.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: The date stamp on the picture is last month.
Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s not real… That’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh, please–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s not a real picture, Stacy, it’s been
doctored-up.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I think you should leave now, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Leave this house.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, this card’s been
declined.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s a brand new card.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Maybe it’s not connected yet.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Here, you can use this.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My suitcase–</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My suitcase is gone.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m sure we can locate it for you,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Don’t count on it.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: God Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: Have you ever tucked your kid in from
a phone booth? You will–</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: In Richmond today, Senate Majority
Leader Sam Albert paid a visit to promote the ten-billion dollar
Anti-Terror Bill.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: America is under assault, and this
time it’s from within. The gangs, the terrorists, the drug lords, the
cults…</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: It’s a war like any other war. A war
with victims and a war that requires courage and strength.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m not sure I understand. You wanna
fuckin’ what?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’d like to speak to someone about what’s
happening to me.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: What’d this guy say his name was?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: This is Bobby Dean, the Jew lawyer who squeezed
DePinto.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Actually, that’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You didn’t squeeze DePinto?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, I meant I’m Presbyterian.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My wife’s Jewish. But that probably doesn’t
matter right now.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Someone’s trying to destroy my life, and I’d
like to find out who.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ll see if I can, you know, work things
out.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Well we’d sure like to help you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You would?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Yes. But we can’t.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Because we, and our associates, have paid
out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you,
because of shyster lawyers like you, and we’d just as soon sit back and
sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: He shot wildlife footage–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I know, but–</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Wildlife footage, for God’s sake. I don’t see
how he could’ve slipped you something that the FBI would be interested
in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s my point.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What’s your point.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Because my life is being ruined.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Daniel’s life is already ruined. Maybe if you
guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good. You’re just what I need right now.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s really not a good idea for me to be
seen with you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Who’s doing this?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Will you hang on just a second.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Rachel? There a problem?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No. No problem. Outside.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There’s a lot of people asking questions
about you and me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The IRS contacted me this morning. They say
my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You being audited?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: For the last four years.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My firm’ll represent you. Free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t work there anymore, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s temporary.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Rachel–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We’re screwed.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m gonna fix it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Tell me about Brill.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You have to.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ve never met him?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fuck you. When you needed information, I got
it. You didn’t care how.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I did care how.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: This conversation’s over.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What’re you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in
a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t have a life, Bobby. I’m in love with
a married man.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What makes you think it’s you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s not me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re a moron, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: When I need to reach Brill, I chalk the
mailbox on 14th and Main.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: When he sees the mark, he knows there’s a
drop. The location’s always the same.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The number twelve ferry to Glen Burnie.
Tuesdays or Fridays.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The drop’s behind Seat 74. I leave
something, he picks it up later.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Any idea what he looks like?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: My guess is male, somewhere in his 40’s or
50’s.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Race, height, weight, you’re on your
own.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Now I don’t know how he’s gonna feel about
someone tracking him down. He’s reclusive. I’m sure he has his
reasons.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Jesus! What?! You want money?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Your shoe.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My shoe?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Gimme the shoe.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Brill?</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: Brill’s dead. He died of small pox when he
was two and he was buried in a Kansas field. My name doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: A tracker. Thousand yard range. They’re
close.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: No. In back like you’re a customer.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It started with the information you gave me on
DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective
asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about
an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started
looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper.
Overnight, I’m ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: DePinto’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: They found him yesterday folded neatly in a
car trunk. What about Zavitz?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know anything about Zavitz.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: You said he was behind an extortion
scheme.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: They said he was behind an extortion
scheme.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: And you were the last one to talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: What’d he say to you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: What’d he give to you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: Don’t bullshit me, I can save your
life.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m telling you, I–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I just gave him my card.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: He didn’t give you an address? He didn’t
give you a phone number?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I’m
pretty sure they were pros.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Um…who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: Don’t know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe
it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Someone else?</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: Maybe you bumped into someone who took it
and you didn’t even know.</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: 209 to anyone! I need some help here!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Who are you calling?!</p>
<p><strong>“brill”</strong>: This is 209! Does anyone copy?!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Look out! He’s got a gun!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy, don’t hang up.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you know what I’m looking at Robert?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m looking at a picture of you and Rachel
taken yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I know, but listen–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Was that doctored-up, too?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to
take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right
now.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I went to the grocery store. My ATM and
credit cards didn’t work. I couldn’t buy food.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I went to the bank to see why. They said you
emptied our accounts–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: This is science-fiction Robert! The manager
showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy, somebody’s trying to kill me. Now
goddamit–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: My father’s put me in touch with an attorney.
He’ll be–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Put the phone down. Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Alright, alright–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Move to the elevators.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We just picked up his call.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: 30 minutes ago you said we had him. What
in hell’s goin’ on out there?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: He had help.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Help from whom? Christ.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don’t
ever mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know you, I don’t know your name, I
don’t know what the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and
slam me into a wall, but I’m getting pretty fuckin’ sick of this! Get
it?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Seat 74.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re Brill.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: You knew the deal. No contact.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Who was that other guy?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: One of many people who would live a word with
you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: You’ve heard of the National Security
Agency?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What do they have to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: That’s who they are.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: The NSA?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: You drive a black BMW, license plate
SRK1339?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I clipped this from your wheel well just
before they towed your car away.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: It’s a SAT-tracker.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of
what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the
Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: It means the NSA can read the time off your
wristwatch.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why are they after me?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: If I knew, they’d be after me. Which they
probably are right now. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Wait. What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Pal, you’re cooked. It’s over. What you did,
who you were…that’s done. I’d find a quiet job somewhere shoveling
snow.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why don’t they just identify themselves and
tell me what they want?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: They’re spooks.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know what that–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Exposure. They can’t have it. They wanna
learn what you know and then deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the
rest of my life?!</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Hey, if you live another week I’ll be
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Look, you gave me some work over the last
year. We’ll call it even.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if I find out what they’re after. You
know these people, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: And you won’t. Now move–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ll pay you.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: They froze your accounts. Get outa my
way.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ve got a hundred-thousand dollars in jewelry
in a safe-deposit box under a third party name.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: How many years have you been hiding from them?
How many years have you been running? What’d they do to you?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: If you find something, chalk the Baltimore
Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It’s South of Salisbury. And
take this.</p>
<p><strong>dean’s pov</strong>: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the
building. MEN storm out an move inside.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: 303 to 301. Floor one secured. Moving to
two.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Open the door, Mr. Dean. There’s nowhere to
go. We’d just like to talk.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It’d be easier for all of us if you just come
out. Nothing’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It’s quite hopeless what you’re doing,
Mr. Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I swear to God I’ll shoot.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I think you might be over-reacting there,
Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Go ahead. I hear you fine.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I said I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: I don’t fuckin’ believe this! 301 to all
units. Everyone out! Now! We’ll take him at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Tell him to stop the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Tell him to stop the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Now you’re a little shaken up, but we’re
gonna get you on your feet in–</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: –stop the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I hate these guys.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: I’m confused about something. Maybe you
can help me out.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: I sit on top of the greatest intelligence
gathering organization in human history. Why can’t I bring in a man
whose name is in the fucking phonebook?!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: He’s clever. He had help.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: He’s clever? He had help? Oh.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Sir–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: No, no, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you
were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: I just meant–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: I don’t care if he’s Solomon with Saint
Joseph sitting in his lap. I want the tape and I want him. Now is–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Puffed cheese?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms
stuffed with–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Then let’s assume I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Now is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>dean’s pov</strong>: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in
bed.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh God–</p>
<p><strong>dean’s pov</strong>: An oxford button-down. The inside collar
is stamped with a dry-cleaner’s marker reading: R. DEAN.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Jerry–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Ssh!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Bobby–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s the NSA. They’re the ones doing this.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Bobby–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: The NSA’s doing this ’cause they think I have
something. And they killed–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: They killed Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Rachel’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My stuff’s all over her apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Bobby–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: They’re framing me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why would they–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know. I mean–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why would the NSA–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re tired.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Jerry–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You gotta–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you
in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, I–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You gotta let me bring you in to the
police.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I won’t make it to the police. They won’t let
me get there. You go.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: To the cops?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell ’em to stop.
Tell ’em I don’t have what they’re after. Make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Bobby, you’re in way over your head.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Go to ’em, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I have a family.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: So do I!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No. No, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Bobby? Piece of advice?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Turn yourself in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Robert–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Listen to me. The house is bugged. So we gotta
be quiet, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Is Eric in school?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Just reporters.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I wish you’d gone to your parents like I asked
you.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: This is my house. Nobody’s kicking me out of
my house. I picked those drapes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy,
I think the drapes are okay.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What happened to your head?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I was in a car chase and a small explosion.
Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you
about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip
of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they’re doing all these
things electronically. The bank records, the surveillance. They’re the
ones who broke into the house. Now I know there’s no reason to believe
me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Does that hurt?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well…yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I told you they could do this. I told you
they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it
would be just another–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Stacy…Stacy…maybe now isn’t the best time for
the I-Told-You-So speech.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I opened the present you got me from
Harrison’s.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You opened the thing?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: The lingerie.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That was for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I was missing you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re as bad as Eric. I’ve got an entire
family of people who root through–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: …who root through…uh…presents, and…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh Christ.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: 504 to 501. Rover’s fleeing west on Sutton.
Driver appeared male!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’s the wife’s ‘20’?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: She’s off location with a friend.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Alright - move! 501 - all units. Take him
down!</p>
<p><strong>another agent</strong>: 502 to 501, I’ve got the eyeball.
He’s approaching Ridgeview, we’ll take him at the intersection.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Eric?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Your father’s here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Having an adventure. I can’t tell you about it
right now, but I’ll tell you about it soon.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Are you and mom getting a divorce?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No. We’re never getting a divorce. We were
having a fight. It happens sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Who won the fight?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Men don’t win fights with women, son, I’ll
tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I’ve got a question
for you, and it’s incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under
no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of-
Jail-Free card. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Did you take anything–anything at all–out of
those Christmas bags I brought home last week.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Hey, Mr. D., what’s happenin’?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Dylan, I was just asking Eric if–</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Oh, God, I knew it was stupid, I knew we’d
get caught. But the Gameboy was just sitting there. Right on top of the
bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every
intention of putting it back.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re a tough nut to crack, Dylan.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: It was broken when we found it, I swear. I
tried fixing it for you. I even put in new batteries. The screen
scrambles whenever you boot up. I’d try to get your money back.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Get dressed. We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You could knock on the door, you know, and I’d
open it.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Move it.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Dean, the attorney recently under
investigation for a money laundering scheme, was seen leaving Ms. Banks
apartment late last night.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Police are seeking–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I taped it off the 11 o’clock news.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: And you were worried about me. That’s nice, I
appreciate–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I was worried about my hundred and twenty
‘K’.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We said a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: The price rises with the temperature and
right now you’re smokin’. But you’re right, you should shop around and
get the best price. I’ll just let you out here.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: One-twenty.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Did you call anyone?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I mean did you call anyone.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Look, my wife is understandably–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I called my wife!</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: What’d I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I didn’t use my name.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: What’d I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I called from a payphone!</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: What’d I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You told me no calls.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I told you no calls.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: You don’t get it. They go through your phone
records. They fuckin’ monitor everyone you called in the last–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I didn’t use my name.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Oh, I’ll bet that threw ’em off the scent. I
sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a
funny voice!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t hear anything. Maybe you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: A hundred and fifty.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: It’s a consumated marriage.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: The NSA’s been in bed with the entire
tele-communications industry since the 40’s. They’ve infected
everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it. The more technology
we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It’s a brave new
world. At least it better be.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: How do you know so much?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You used to work for ’em, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I was a traffic analyst.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I intercepted phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: How’d you get around the tap orders?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: They can tap anything as along as it’s an
airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do. Hard-line calls
we’d pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or
fired up to the SATs. We’d suck in everything. All foreign, most
domestic. Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone
we wanted.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: How’d you have the manpower to–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Meade has 18 underground acres of computers.
They scan every phonecall for target words like “bomb” or “President”.
We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints…whatever we wanted. When the
computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: That was twenty years ago. With digital? They
can suck a salt grain off a beach.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why’d you leave?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: It was ’72. I figured we had enough problems
without monitoring a Berkeley kid’s class schedule. So I sold my story
to Ramparts and split.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: They come after you?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Well…there’d be too much disclosure to
prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I’d never hold a
real job again.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Looks like Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Welcome to Santa’s Workshop.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I call it the jar. No phone or utility lines
going in.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Self-contained. Unplugged from the world.
Nothing for a wire bug to piggy- back in on. That leaves only
transmitters and signal sweep for those. Now let’s see what we got.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: That is one ugly sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It really is. Did you find anything?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Yeah. Take a walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an
accident up near Shenandoah?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: The NSA killed him.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Jesus. Do you have proof?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Well, actually, you have proof. Could you
walk a little faster please.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: They’re here.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Them.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Here?!</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: In the warehouse. They’re hiding in a duct on
the third floor. When we go back inside, they’re gonna kill us. When
they notice that we’re moving toward the car, they’ll come running out
of the building.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: ’Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They’re heading to the car.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Move it.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Empty ’em ’till they’re almost flat. And turn
your head. There might be some debris flying your way.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What the fuck?!</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: They shouldn’t have come without calling
first.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Where’s your gun?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Back at the warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Gimme that.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re driving.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Those are Feds.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I didn’t see a warrant. Did you see a
warrant?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Think we let out enough air?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: We lost ’em.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That wasn’t so hard.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Fuckin-A.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Let’s not do the tire thing anymore, okay?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Yeah, I can see where that’d–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: These guys are incredibly persistent.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We’re not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Tell him we’re not gonna hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Drive or I’ll blow your fuckin’ head off.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No he won’t.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Goddammit–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We’re honest people and we need your help.
I’ll give you two- hundred dollars if you–</p>
<p><strong>grunge-dude</strong>: Take it!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Actually, I don’t have two-hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Drive the damn car!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We found two sets of latent prints in the
rubble of Brill’s studio. One was Dean’s. The other, we believe, belongs
to Brill.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: We believe?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Well…his real name’s Edward Lyle.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Lyle?!</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: You’re kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Dean’s with Lyle.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: And they have the video. That’s
confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: So they know everything.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: If they’ve looked at the video.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Oh, let’s assume that they have.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: If he’s with Lyle it means he’s got
resources.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Resources, that’s a good point. He’s got
resources. All we’ve got is a six-hundred billion dollar organization!
Now goddammit, Hicks, you find ’em. You find ’em and you end it now!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We’ll take the tape directly to CBS. I’ll hand
it directly to the News Department.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Listen to you, “directly”. You’re not gonna
get near the News Department. And if you did, it’d never get on the air.
Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What about newspapers and magazines?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Same thing?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: So what do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I was thinkin’ about asking for my hundred
and fifty grand and calling it quits.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: It’d never get through. All packages are
screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn’t like
my “give-me-my- money” idea?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if we hand deliver to their homes or
office?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: The area’s wired for surveillance, they’ll be
looking for those moves.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well how do I know what they’re–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I know. I know what they’re looking for and
I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: –after which, Senator Albert will
address a fund-raiser at Boston University.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if we put it on the internet?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Have you seen how fuckin’ slow the net is?
It’d take ten minutes to unload enough video so that people know what
they’re seeing, and it’d take the NSA maybe 40 seconds to see it coming
down and shut down the access.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: –this will be the last stop on the
Senator’s eight-city tour before the Senate votes on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: But maybe if there were no phone line–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: What if we transmitted it over cellular?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Listen–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Nah, they’d shut down the pin number.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: If they couldn’t do that, they’d shut down
the whole system, all the relays.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: They’ve done it before. Takes maybe two
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: What if what?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What if we just fucked with ’em?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Same way they did with you and me. We take
their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Senator Sam Albert, senior Republican. Very
well respected.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We’ll play the NSA’s game only we’ll play it
badly.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: You wanna get caught spying on Albert?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on
Albert.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We’re gonna lead Albert by the nose to one
conclusion. And then when he’s pissed as hell, we’re gonna drop the tape
in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: How fast can you learn?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Pretty fast.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: We’ll have to re-stock some basics.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Bugs, frequency scanners, contact mics,
transmitters, pin-holes, fiber optics–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: What do you know about locking cellular phone
signals?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I know my phone number and I know the number
for SportsPhone. Beyond that–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: A ‘modified’ OKI 900 interfaced with a
lap-top creates an enormously powerful tool. I got into the software,
did some code re-writing and turned it into one of the best scan-looking
systems around.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: This is every call on the grid. I can lock
and position any one I want and follow the hand-offs in real time.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Super Shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: This is Dr. Jonathan Phillips, 102
Stern Drive in Brockton. I need an airport ride on Friday at 6 PM with a
return pick-up Monday at 5. There’ll be two of us and–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Need a place to stay for the weekend? A new
TV?</p>
<p><strong>another man’s voice</strong>: Triple-A Emergency Road
Service. May I have your name and membership number?</p>
<p><strong>young woman’s voice</strong>: Colleen Crane. Card number
020-113–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: All from a hundred dollar scanner at Radio
Shack. But it’s time for business.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What are you dialing?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: AmeriTech’s data-base. There’s Albert’s D.C.
office address and his phone’s identity code. Now we just reprogram out
phone with his ID code and you know what we’ve got?</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: –Don’t think it could’ve gone any
better. Tell me, how’s Deb? How’re my grandchildren?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator’s
phone.</p>
<p><strong>senator’s wife</strong>: Melissa has a fever. When will you
be in the room?</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Not ’till later tonight. We’re going
to the campus now. I’ll call you after I’ve checked in. I love you too,
dear.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: She just left.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: The important thing about installations is
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: They may find one, but they’re not gonna find
’em all.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Can you send someone up right away. I’m
having a problem with my TV… It’s screeching and I– It’s screeching and
I–</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: It’s screeching and I can’t turn it
off.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: What happened to you last night?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Christa found it last night attached to her
TV. It’s a listening device.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: A bug?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Jesus H.–</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: We should everything checked. There’s a
company in Cambridge called Baudmore. They’re discreet.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Well get somebody down here today. I
don’t know what the hell this is all about.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He’s going into the payphone outside the
restaurant. It’s a Cambridge company called Baudmore.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Baudmore Consultants.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Is Jerry Delsano in?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It’s Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam
Albert and I was given Jerry’s name.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Jerry’s on vacation ’till Monday. I can give
him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last
name–</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: The thing is…it really can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: My name’s Neil. Maybe I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Oh yeah. Got another one here.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Nasty fella. A TX-703. Remote on- off,
three-thousand foot range. Shit, you could listen from a shopping mall
across the street.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Well, sir, I’m afraid it’s not as simple as
that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they
can’t buy this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Well then who can?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Ah, sir, you know, it’s not for me to
say.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: What do you mean? Who can buy this
kind of equipment.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: The thing is, Senator, and I don’t want to
get in the middle of nothing, but–</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Most of this stuff’s only available to law
enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Law enforcement?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Are you sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: I yanked this off your RV. It’s a Global
Positioning Tracker.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Tracks your location to the inch and works
directly with–you know…</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: With spy satellites. I don’t like saying
these things Senator…</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Neil, thank you for your help.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: This is Sam Albert. Put me through
to Langley. Dick Marshal’s office.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Albert’s primed. We’ll let him stew for a day
and then drop the tape.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He came in four minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: One-Lincoln-Nine. In pursuit of two suspects,
one matching description of Robert Dean, wanted in connection with a
homicide. Suspects northbound on–</p>
<p><strong>brill</strong>: Feeling lucky?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Not particularly, no.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Shit. I’m stuck. Help me out.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA’d into a coal car
at the Fullbright rail-yards. Requesting back-up, fire and
ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: FBI. What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Two murder suspects. One’s wounded, the other’s
maybe dead.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Check inside.</p>
<p><strong>krug</strong>: I hate doin’ cops, I really do. You I won’t
mind. Didn’t mind that Rachel Banks. Didn’t mind doin’ her one bit. Your
lawyer friend buried over there?</p>
<p><strong>krug</strong>: Fuck him, he’s dead in two minutes. Find
Dean.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck–</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: I just came from my office at Langley.
Senator Albert called me there.</p>
<p><strong>shaffer</strong>: I got the same call at the Bureau. He’s
upset.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: About what? Do I look stupid?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Ken–</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Does Shaffer look stupid to you?</p>
<p><strong>shaffer</strong>: We’re not stupid, Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: The fuck do you have goin’ on with Sam
Albert?</p>
<p><strong>shaffer</strong>: This guy’s carrying the flag for the damn
terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: You have any idea what kind of position
this–</p>
<p><strong>shaffer</strong>: He’s carrying the damn flag.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: We’re not doing anything with Sam
Albert.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: He thinks we’re stupid.</p>
<p><strong>shaffer</strong>: He found an NSA SAT tracker on his motor
home today.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: It’s not ours.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.</p>
<p><strong>shaffer</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on, but if you
people have tripped over your own asshole again, you’re not gonna get
any help from us. It’s ending at your doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Brill’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What about–</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Explain that.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Jones had to flee the scene before we could
locate the second body.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What about the tape?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We think it was on Brill. If it was, it’s
destroyed now.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: And if it wasn’t?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Peace be with you.</p>
<p><strong>chorus of parishioners</strong>: And also with you.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The Lord said: I leave you peace, my peace I
leave you. Let us now, in the spirit of these holidays, turn to our
neighbors and offer them a sign of peace.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Peace be with you…Peace be with you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Merry Christmas. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m Robert Dean. Within twelve hours, you’re
gonna be in jail. Peace be with you.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Let us now offer up thanks to the Lord our
God in the words our Father gave us.</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallow’d be thy name–</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Robert, is it safe to be talking on the phone
like this?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ve re-routed the call. They can’t trace
it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Are you sure you’re safe?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: They’re saying you killed that policeman.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s gonna end tonight.</p>
<p><strong>close on a microwave tower with nine gray cones</strong>:
pointing nine directions. The intercepted phone signals being
relayed.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I can’t tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Can you tell me anything?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I can tell you this: That anti- terrorism bill
you were so worked up about? I don’t think it’s gonna pass.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five
minutes ago. He’s stationary.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Do you have visual?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Not yet. He’s near “M” and 34th. I’ve got an
ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What’s your ETA?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: Three minutes. We’re going in light. Myself
and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: He walked right up to me in church. At the
holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place. Kill
him now.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: The fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Nine-one-one emergency.</p>
<p><strong>old man’s voice</strong>: My name’s Jack Kreuger, I’m at 1102
Grambling. I just saw three guys break into the condo next door. It
looked to me like they had guns.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: We’ll send a unit over there now. If
it’s safe, sir, we’d like you to stay by your phone.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, I think I’ll stay where I am.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Any available unit. Armed 549 in
progress.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Three suspects now inside. 1102
Grambling, apartment 302.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Shit. 201 to First Team. Pull out. We
got the cops.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: It came off in my hand!</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Get outa there, guys!</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Goddamit!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’s so fuckin’ funny?</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: It’s over. We’ve been fucked with our pants
on.</p>
<p><strong>hicks</strong>: We broke into her condo.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Oh my God! What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Ma’am, is this your apartment?</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Would you step out in the hallway for a
moment, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Please. We’ll be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Christa?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You got a second?</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: My name’s Robert Dean.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I understand we have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Senator–</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Senator, there were some things I couldn’t
tell you over the phone.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: What kinds of things?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Mr. Dean has a video tape from the hotel
room in Boston.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning
with a frequency modulator.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Me neither, but the upshot is I’ve got color
live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn’t look good.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: So…how much money do you want in exchange
for not ruining my life?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t want any money. And believe me, I have
no interest in ruining your life. I’m not interested in this tape.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Then what do you want from the Senator?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I want him to look at a different tape. People
have been killed. Lives have been ruined. Senator, I want you to look at
this. And I want you to bring the fury of God himself upon this man.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Sir, we’ve just intercepted an FBI
communication.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Well…what is it?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Well, sir, it seems there’s a warrant
out on–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds wife</strong>: Who is that, dear?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: John Reynolds?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What the hell–</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: You’re under arrest. You have the right
to remain silent. Anything you say–</p>
<p><strong>reynolds wife</strong>: Honey…?</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Privacy and the right to privacy is
an inalienable right.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: These guys are always making speeches.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s an important speech, Eric. There’s gonna
be a vote today.</p>
<p><strong>senator albert</strong>: Today we face a threat to that
creed. Certain individuals in our intelligence community believe they’re
entitled to examine lives in minute detail, and claim to do it in the
name of the common good.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: If they’re voting today, hasn’t everyone
pretty much made up their minds.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Actually, this man appears to have changed
his mind dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He saw the light, my son.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How long can you stay?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m not goin’ anywhere, Eric. I live here.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Get ready for school, you’re gonna be
late.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Is it okay to use the phone now?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s okay to use the phone.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No “900” numbers.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s really over?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Albert’s gonna get me my job back.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m sorry about Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah. I wish you could’ve met…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: A friend of mine. I don’t know his real name.
He’s dead now.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You did good.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I’ve lived through the dark ages of Hoover’s
Watch-List and McCarthy’s Witch Hunts - men who used moral crusades,
fired by fear, to lay waste to our freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: C’mon upstairs. I’ve got a Christmas present
from Harrison’s I want to show you.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Our intelligence communities presently
monitor our phones, computers, financial transactions, medical
histories…all this and more. Some of you may say, “Fine. I’m not a
criminal and I have nothing to hide.” Well God forbid we ever edge to
tyranny. God forbid George Orwell’s version of America becomes a
reality. We are that close.</p>
