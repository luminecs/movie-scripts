<p><strong>laredo</strong>: We’re exiting the time knot now sir!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>laredo</strong>: We made it Commander, we made it!</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: By Grabthar’s hammer, we live to tell the
tale.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Systems register functional.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: All systems are working, Commander.
Commander?</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: I don’t like it. It was too easy… Look
for ambient energy fields.</p>
<p><strong>laredo</strong>: All normal sir… The entire spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Check again Laredo.</p>
<p><strong>laredo</strong>: Yes sir, I- Wait. Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>laredo</strong>: They’re everywhere. There are time knots
opening everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: IMPACT NOW Commander</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: A trap.</p>
<p><strong>lazarus.</strong>: We’re surrounded Commander. The entire 5k
Ranking is out there.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Our plasma armor?</p>
<p><strong>laredo</strong>: Gone sir.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Structural damage at 68 percent.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We’re getting major structural damage.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s a core meltdown sir. It can’t be
stopped</p>
<p><strong>lazarus</strong>: Commander, surrender may be our only
option.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: No, never give up… NEVER surrender.’</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The reactor has eaten through four levels… Six
levels… The ship is disintegrating</p>
<p><strong>laredo</strong>: Your orders sir?… Sir, your orders?</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Activate the Omega 13.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, there you are! You are the first people
to see the lost GALAXY QUEST episode 52 two parter since it was
originally aired in ’82! As most of you know, no concluding episode was
filmed when the series was cancelled, so one episode was never included
in the syndication run. Let’s hear it for Travis Latke, who actually
rescued the footage from the studio garbage! Can you believe that? Now
for the moment you’ve all been waiting for… The intrepid crew of the
NSEA PROTECTOR!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: But first… What is a “hero”? Let’s take a look
at a few more clips…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Where the hell is he? An hour and a half
late. An hour and a half!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: This is great! They’re going to start eating
each other out there.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: He’s a twit!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan
appearance without us?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You’re kidding. When for?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tomorrow morning, before the store
opening.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: He’s a miserable twit!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The guy is terminally selfish!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: He ate my sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>gwen and tommy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: A month ago, he ate my sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And he ate Fred’s SANDWICH!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh Alex, get away from that thing…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Dear God…. How did I come to this?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Not again…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I played Richard III…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: “Five curtain calls…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: …Five curtain calls! I was an ACTOR once,
damn it. Now look at me… LOOK AT ME.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Settle down, Alex…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: No. I can’t go out there! I won’t say
that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won’t. I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: At least you had a PART. You had a character
people loved! My TV Guide interview was six paragraphs about this body
suit. About my legs. How did I perfect my trademark sidesaddle pose?
Nobody ever bothered to ask what I DO on the ship…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You were the, uh… Wait I’ll think of it…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I repeated the computer. “It’s getting hotter,
Commander!” “The ship is disintegrating, Commander!” Nothing I did EVER
affected the plot, not ONCE! Nothing I did was ever taken seriously!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Excuse me. I’m an African American playing a
nine year old Malaysian named Laredo. HELLO!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: My friends, your Commander has arrived!… Am I
too late for Alexander’s panic attack?… Apparently so. That’s irregular,
you should have it looked at. Lakers are HOT. Speaking of which… Gwen,
you look spectacular. Oh, what did I do now?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: … Sure, the rocks looked hollow and the sets
moved when anyone humped into them… But we didn’t care…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: ….For those four seasons from ’79 to ’82 we the
viewers developed the same affection for the crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR
that the crew had for each other… These weren’t just adventurers
exploring space, these were friends…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You said we do appearances together, or not
at all.’</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I didn’t say that. I said “wouldn’t it be
great if we could always, work together.” That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You are so full of shit</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: A few fans built a little set in their
garage. . I come in for an hour at most. It’s a nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: How much of a nothing? Not enough to split
five ways kind of a nothing?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What do you want me to say, Gwen?… They
wanted the Commander.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Okay, here we go… Let’s hear a warm welcome for
crack gunner/navigator. Laredo, Tommy Webber!</p>
<p><strong>tommy (film clip) as laredo</strong>: “If it’s got quantum
rockets, I can fly it.”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Ship’s Tech Sergeant Chen… Fred Kwan!</p>
<p><strong>fred as chen</strong>: “Give me a stick of gum and a hairpin
and we re on our way!”</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Alex you can’t -just leave.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Oh can’t I? Watch me!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Come on, old friend…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Friend. You stole all my best lines. You
cut me out of episode two entirely!..</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: The beautiful shipmate Tawny Madison… GWEN
DEMARCO!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: One hundred degrees and rising…</p>
<p><strong>gwen as tawny ~~~ison</strong>: “It’s… It’s getting hotter,
Commander.’”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And now… The Commander’s advisor and closest
friend. His peaceful nature ever at odds with the savage warrior inside
him, after witnessing the massacre of his entire species as a boy…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You WILL go out there.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I won’t and nothing you say-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: “The show must go on.”</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: …Damn you! Damn you!</p>
<p><strong>alex as lazarus onscreen</strong>: “By Grabthar’s hammer, you
shall be avenged.’”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And finally, my fellow Questarians, the brave
Commander of the NSEA PROTECTOR… Peter Quincy Taggart … JASON
NESMITH.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Unbelievable. He rented a SPOT?</p>
<p><strong>jason/jason on screen/everyone</strong>: “NEVER GIVE UP,
NEVER SURRENDER… DAMN THE RESONANCE CANNONS, FULL SPEED AHEAD.’”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: The Commander and his crew will be signing
autographs on imperial decks “b” and “c” near the coke machines.</p>
<p><strong>alien</strong>: …Yeah, I used to De Gark’nor of Ang but I got
a rash from the chest pads so now I’m Sacnod from episode 5, which is
fine except the transducer pinches when I sit down…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: The tail fin is concave, not convex. The
proton reactor is where the influx thermistors should be and.. my god…
is this Testor’s blue green number six on the hull? I… I… This is a
complete abortion.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Is it me or does his table get higher every
convention?</p>
<p><strong>fan</strong>: “By Grabthar’s hammer, by the suns of Warvan, I
shall avenge you!”</p>
<p><strong>fan</strong>: “By Grabthar’s hammer, by the-”</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hi everybody.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey. Thanks for one nice intro… uh.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Guy… You probably don’t remember me do you? I
was on the show in ’82. Episode 31? Got killed by the lava monster
before the first commercial? “Crewman #6?”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if
I sit in today? See if anybody’s interested in an autograph? Never
know.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Sure, Guy, If you can stand the
excitement.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Don’t make me get a restraining
order.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mr. Kwan? In episode nineteen, when the
reactor fused, you used an element from Leopold Six to fix the quantum
rockets. What was that called?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Bivrakium.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: The blue sheath it was encased in-?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: A bi-thermal krevlite housing.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How do you remember this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh I make it up. Use lots of “k”s and
“v”s.</p>
<p><strong>fan</strong>: I’m a big fan Ms. Demarco.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You really expect me to sign a naked picture
of myself? This isn’t even my body!</p>
<p><strong>fan</strong>: Yeah, normally with fakes it’s like, recycle
bin. But.. This one’s really good. Could you not write over the…
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Episode 12. Killed by the lava monster?..</p>
<p><strong>fan</strong>: Laredo, could I get an autograph?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: … on one hand, if I had moved an inch, the
beast would have killed me. On the other hand, my crew was in
danger…</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: How did you know what to do?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Without a crew, I’m not a Commander.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: And we all know what happened to that beast
on Enok 7…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You gotta admit, they do love him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Almost as much as he loves himself.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m glad you asked… To me the most important
qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: … to camera center no matter whose shot
you’re blocking…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Leadership….</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … to make sure craft service keeps those
little butter cookies, and plenty of them-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: And determination.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: … to playing scenes shirtless because the
ladies do love Commander furry.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Commander, please settle a dispute that my
crew and I are having. In “The Quasar Dilemma”, the Sentient had taken
control of the ship’s guidance systems, however-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Excuse me guys.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I hadn’t even gotten to the relevant
conundrum…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Miss Demarco?… In episode 15, “Mist of Delos
5?” I got the feeling you and the Commander kind of had a thing in the
swamp when you were stranded together. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The Commander and I NEVER had a thing.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That’s her story.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You smiled at me.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Commander, I must speak to you. It is a
matter of supreme importance… We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula,
and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our
ship. A great many lives hang in the balance…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow
you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a
limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one
of these</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: I… certainly, but-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Catch me later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: “Crewman Madison, I.. I’m sorry. Whatever I
do next I have no control over. It’s the mist on this strange planet,
It’s filling my head with such thoughts….</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It was cute when I didn’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>cynical guy 1</strong>: You’re right. What a FREAK SHOW. This
is fricking HILARIOUS.</p>
<p><strong>cynical guy 2</strong>: Yeah, what a bunch of losers. And
those poor actors. They’ve done, like, WHAT for twenty years? I think
Fred Kwan did a dog food commercial… Sad.</p>
<p><strong>cynical guy 1</strong>: Did you hear Nesmith up there? That’s
the saddest. I think he actually gets off on these nerds thinking he’s
space Commander. It’s pathetic. And his friends…</p>
<p><strong>cynical guy 2</strong>: … they HATE him. I know, did you hear
them ragging on him?!! “Commander furry!…”</p>
<p><strong>cynical guy 1</strong>: He has no idea that he’s a
laughingstock… Even to his buddies.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Commander, as I was saying… In “The Quasar
Dilemma”, you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But
online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix,
so we were wondering where the error lies?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s a television show. Okay? That’s all.
It’s just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Yes but, we were wondering-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There IS no quantum flux and there Is no
auxiliary… There’s no goddamn ship Do you get it?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I don’t know, Alex, he’s never gone quite this
far before…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I’ve said for years he’s mentally
unstable.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Oh good, there’s nothing to eat.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Why didn’t you stop at the market?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I still haven’t got this bloody thing
off.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You could order something in.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: A boy comes to the door.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I don’t know… It just wasn’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he’s
probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While
here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.</p>
<p><strong>commander taggart</strong>: As long as there is injustice,
whenever a Targathian baby cries out, wherever a distress signal sounds
among the stars… We’ll be there. This fine ship, and this fine crew…
Never give up! Never surrender!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: WHAT. DO. YOU. WANT?!</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Sir, I understand this is a terrible
breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are
Thermians from the Klatu Nebula. Our people are being systematically
hunted and slaughtered by Roth’h’ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants
the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in
this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the
death… Please Captain, you are our last hope. We have secured a
limousine.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on
in, I’ll get some pants on.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Commander, standing here in your presence
is the greatest honor we could ever have hoped to achieve in our
lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Thanks, appreciate it… Anybody seen my other
shoe?</p>
<p><strong>neru</strong>: Sir, I am Neru, senior requisition officer.
Before we travel to the ship, please let me know if you have any
requirements. Weapons, documents, personnel…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I could use a Coke.</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: Sir, I am Teb. I would like to explain the
history between our people and the Sarris Dominion in greater detail. In
the 5 million years following the great nebula burst our people were
one…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What about him? Doesn’t he talk?</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: His translator is broken.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okey doke… So, listen, I had a late night
with a Kreemorian Fangor Beast, so</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: I am sorry to wake you sir, but your
presence is requested on the command deck.</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline. We are
approaching his ship at the Ni-delta now. He wants an answer to his
proposal. I understand you have been briefed.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah, I got most of it in the car. He’s the
bad guy, right?</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: Yes sir he is a very bad man indeed. He has
tortured our scientists, put us to work in the gallium arsenide mines,
captured our females for his own demented purposes…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay I’ve got the picture. You have pages or
do you want me to just go for it?</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: I m not sure I…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Commander… Welcome to the Protector II.
Would you like to don your uniform?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mind If we skip that? I have to get back
pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Not bad. Usually it’s painted cardboard boxes
in a garage.</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: Sir, we apologize for operating in low power
mode, but we are experiencing a reflective flux field this close to the
galactic axis.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No problem. This thing have a cup holder?</p>
<p><strong>excited alien</strong>: The situational analysis,
Commander.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>excited alien</strong>: …Glath sir.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: We’re approaching in five ticks, sir.
Command to slow?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Sure, set the screen saver on two. Sorry.
Sorry. Didn’t mean to break he mood. Slow to Mark 2, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: I see fear. That is expected. Ah, they bring
a new Commander… Such a cowardly species. Not even your own kind… No
matter. Here are my demands, and I would suggest, Commander, that you
think well before speaking a word, because these negotiations are…
tender.. and if I do not like what I hear there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine…</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: First, I require the Omega 13… Second-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okey dokey, let’s fire blue particle cannons
full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and
right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him
too, killer.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Commander?… Where are you… going?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: You… You mean Earth?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah. “Earth.” Time to get back to “Earth,”
kids.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: But Commander… The negotiation… You… You…
You fired on him.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Right. Long live… What’s your planet?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Theramin.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Long live Theramini. Take a left here?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: But what if Sarris survives?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh, I don’t think so. I gave him both
barrels.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you
would like to wait to see the results of-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I would but I am REALLY running late and the
134’s a parking lot after 2:00. But listen, the guy gives you any more
trouble, just give a call…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: An interstellar vox.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Thanks</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: How can we thank you, Commander. You- You
have saved our people.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Wait. Where’s the car?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Take it from us… We’ve been all over the
universe.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But we’ve never seen the space age values
we’ve seen here …..</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: TechCo electronics superstore</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: By Grabthar’s hammer, what a savings.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Commander!… My apologies.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Commander… Evidently we had
miscommunication regarding yesterday’s scheduled voyage, and-</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He probably… Has some very important
business to attend to…</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: Maybe we should just start a Star Trek
club!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Don’t EVER say that to me again.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Do you know what time it is? Why did you
even bother to show up?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason… Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I was there. Up. There… They came to the
convention. I thought they were fans, but they’re not. They took me up
to their ship. They’re called Thermians or Thatians, I don’t know. I was
a little hungover… What they built… It’s incredible I fought this man,
this… THING… called Sarris. I kicked his ASS… They have these… pods. One
took me THROUGH a black hole. I know. I know what you’re thinking. But I
can prove it. Look! They gave me this!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes, but can you talk to people in SPACE on
yours? Protector this is the Commander. Come in protector…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: God, what an ass.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: COME IN PROTECTOR… PROTECTOR…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s it, It’s go time.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Don’t do it, Tommy. He’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: This isn’t mine. Wait, where is that
kid?…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You know it’s one thing to treat us this way,
but how can you do this to your fans?…</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: Begging your pardon, Commander, we come
with news. Sarris lives. He was able upon your departure to make an
escape. However he has contacted us, and wishes to surrender. We humbly
implore you to return with us, to negotiate the terms.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: They want me back… I… I want you all to come.
You have to come with me. It’ll be the most amazing experience of your
lives. We1re going to negotiate an alien general’s SURRENDER in SPACE.
You have to- Guys? GUYS?…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Gwen, you know me. I’m a lot of things but
I’m not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You should have let me hit him.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I don’t know guys… I mean, he almost looked…
sincere. I know, it’s bizarre!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I think we should have taken the gig… I mean,
who knows the next time he’ll ask us.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Commander come through here?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We’re coming too.</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: Wonderful! The Commander had me continue
transmitting in the hopes you would change your mind. Protector,
requesting six Interstellar pods for immediate departure.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Guys… Guys?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: What in the world…?</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: I look forward to meeting you all in person
when we arrive at the ship. End transmission.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh my God. OH MY GOD.</p>
<p><strong>monster #1</strong>: Oops. Crewmen, your skins! Activate your
E-skins!</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: Our most sincere apologies! We forgot
about our appearance generators.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Guys! You CAME!…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay, who wants the grand tour?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay, Guy… Anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Now that was a hell of a thing. What’s wrong
with them?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That’s right… Just keep shaking it out… Here,
have some gum, It helps.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wh… Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector. I can
show you on a map.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Welcome my friends I am Mathesar. On
behalf of my people I wish to thank you from the deepest place in our
hearts.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Dr. Lazarus… Lt. Madison. Young Laredo,
how you’ve grown. Tech Sgt. Chen… And….</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: “Crewman #6”… Call me Guy.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You… know us?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: I don’t believe there is a man, woman or
child on my planet who does not. In the years since we first received
your ship’s historical documents, we have studied every facet of your
missions, technologies and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Historical documents?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Yes. Eighteen years ago we received
transmission of the first. It continued for four years, and then
stopped, as mysteriously as it came…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’ve been watching the sho… the historical
records… out HERE?</p>
<p><strong>mathe ear</strong>: Yes, in the last hundred years our
society had fallen into disarray. Our goals, our values had become
scattered. But since the transmission we have modeled many aspects of
our society from your example, and it has saved us. Your courage,
teamwork, friendship through the adversity…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: THAT’S why you built this ship?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s … incredible.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh this? No, this isn’t the ship. This is
only the star port for the ship. You want to see the ship?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Oh my god, It’s real.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: All this from watching the.. historical
records?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Yes, and from your supplementary technical
documents, of course…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: The medical quarters are to the left…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What the hell is going on?!!?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Jason, what have you gotten us into?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I don’t believe this, it’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wow, the floors are REALLY clean.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Calm down everybody. We’re just here to
negotiate General Sarris’ surrender.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: “Just!?”</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Weapons storage…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s perfectly safe. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: … Maintenance facility…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason, this is crazy! We should get out of
here…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Situations room… Dining hall…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You want to go home? Fine. Say the word, and
we’ll all go home and feed the fish and pay the bills and fall asleep
with the t.v. on and miss out on THIS. Is that really what you want?
Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: At ease men.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Like throwing gasoline on a fire…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m just jazzed to be on the show, man.’</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: The generator room… Our Beryllium Sphere,
of course… I hope, Tech Sergeant Chen, that this meets with your
approval.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fine… Real clean.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Tech Sgt. Chen, I am sorry to ask this of
you so shortly after your arrival. But members of our reactor staff have
a question they find most pressing.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>lahnk</strong>: Sir, we have had unexplained proton surges in
our delta unit. They cannot be verified on the sub frequency spectrum,
but appear on the valence detector when scanning the Beryllium Sphere.
We are unable to resolve this problem and were hoping you would be able
to advise us.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Uh huh… I see… Well, that’s a puzzler isn’t
it?…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: U…. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>nervous tech</strong>: That possibly… The valence bonds have
shifted bi-laterally?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>nervous tech</strong>: What does that mean?!!! Yes, I see!
Yes… It means that perhaps… the… bonding molecules have become
covalent?!…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Covalent… Right. So…</p>
<p><strong>nervous tech</strong>: So our solution is to introduce a
bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron -
and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: OK!</p>
<p><strong>lank</strong>: Of course! It’s so obvious!</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Sergeant Chen, you’re… a genius!</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Now I suggest that you rest before we take
the ship out of dock. These crewmen will escort you to your
quarters.</p>
<p><strong>neru</strong>: Here is your valence shield. Your vox. Your
magneto-pistol… We know you prefer a sensitive trigger. If there is
anything else you require?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Uh, no, I’m good. Thanks. Oh wait. Here you
go.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Dr. Lazarus… I hope that I’m not breaching
protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence… I have
studied your missions extensively… Though I am Thermian, I have lived my
life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak’tar.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Well good, that’s very… nice.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: By Grabthar’s Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Don’t do that. I’m not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, I was only-</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Just don’t.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: …Yes sir. Your quarters sir.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: This is it?</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Yes sir. Marvelous, isn’t it? Completely
distractionless.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Where’s my bed?</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may
say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a
peace I never thought possible…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Is that the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Yes sir… The use of your waste facilities
were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to
extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: You’re quite complicated, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s Jason…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: One minute I’m - Hey, I’m dressing.’</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh come on, it’s not like I haven’t-</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I just can’t believe it. Any of it! Look at
this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from
“historical document” thirty seven. Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!
Computer?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What’s the weather like outside?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: There is no weather in space.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I never get tired of that joke.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Let me try. Computer? Computer?…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Only answers to me.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But I’m the Commander!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: On the show I talk to the computer and repeat
what it says. So that’s what they built.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: C’mon, we’re wanted up on the command
deck.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Wait. When are you going to tell them?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Tell them? About…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Who we are. Don’t you think they’re going to
be PISSED?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Are you kidding? I’m not going to tell
them.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Well you have to tell them. What if something
happens? We’re actors, not astronauts… We can’t do this stuff!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn
the STUFF… The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just
committing to it.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment.
ACTING. Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught
ACTING…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey… Hey where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We have no right to do this. They deserve to
know.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Gwen… Gwen, c’mon, wait, no!</p>
<p><strong>laliari</strong>: Lt. Madison. The females of the ship have
requested your imprint for archival purposes at the proposed Tawny
Madison Institute for Computer Research.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The Tawny Madison Institute…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I think we’re going to exit the space
port.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That should be something to see…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: If you would all take your positions…</p>
<p><strong>the actors</strong>: Oh, right… US! Yes, of course… US!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look.. This thingy… I remember I had it all
worked out. This was forward, back…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Commander, some of the crew has requested
to be present at this historic event.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No pressure, huh? Glad I’m not the
Commander.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Okay, Lareo, take her out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: They designed the ship from watching you. So…
Take her out, Lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Right. Okay, yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh god. Oh my god….</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: More to the left… Stay parallel…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, YOU want to drive?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Very good Lieutenant. Forward Mark two…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mark two, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: To our brave guests. Few in this universe
have the opportunity to meet their heroes. We are blessed to count
ourselves among them.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Wherever a distress signal sounds among the
stars, we’ll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up,
never surrender!</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: We are sorry about the instrumentation, Lt.
Laredo. There must have been a malfunction in the steerage
mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Just see that it doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: Yes sir. How are you enjoying your food, Lt.
Madison?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh it’s fantastic. French is my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: Yes, we programed the food synthesizer for each
of you based on the regional menu of your birthplace. Are you enjoying
your Kep-mok bloodticks Dr. Lazarus?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Just like mother used to make.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: The beast ROARED as I PLUNGED the knife again
and again… I held on for dear life as it thrashed about! And that
was</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Tell me, Mathesar, this Sarris bloke
we’re flying to meet… What is it he wants exactly?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: For years, Sarris has plundered the
resources of our planet. Our people, our technologies. We built this
ship in order to find a new planet to settle. One far away from Sarris.
We are not a people accustomed to confrontation. We are scientists. This
ship was our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: But Sarris found out about our plans just
as we had completed construction of the</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: The Omega 13… Why does that sound so
familiar?…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The lost footage. At the convention. The
mysterious device in our last episo–historical document.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What is it? What does it do?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: We don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: But… You built one, right?</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: We built… something… from the blueprints and
what references we could find on your internet… Our computer neural nets
made educated guesses in areas we were uncertain. So there is actually
much about the device we don’t even understand. We were hoping you could
enlighten us.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Well, it’s… This was a device we… discovered
on an alien planet. We don’t know what it does either.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why don’t you just turn it on and see?</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: It has at its heart a reactor capable of
generating unthinkable energy. If we were mistaken in our construction
by even the slightest calculation, the device would act as a molecular
explosive, causing a chain reaction that would obliterate all matter in
the universe.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Let me at the switch.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the..
historical records?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: NO, Thank God he has not.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Then how did he find out about the
device?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Our former Commander was not… Strong.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Former Commander?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: I’m sorry. You deserve to be shown.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: The tape was partially demagnetized as it
was smuggled off of Sarris’ ship.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Originally, one of our own tried to
lead…</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Is that all? You have no more to confess to
me? No? After three days of this you still require incentive?</p>
<p><strong>alien commander</strong>: I say again… I have told you all I
know. To my shame, I have told you everything. If you have any mercy
within you, please, let me die.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Oh I shall, I shall… When I grow weary of
the noises you make, my little plaything, be assured, you shall die…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We’re leaving, Jason. We’re leaving NOW.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Let me think. I need time to think.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: He wants to THINK!?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, Jason, that’s a wrap! There’s nothing to
think about!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Listen, I’m not even supposed to BE here. I’m
just Crewman #6. I’m expendable. I’m the guy in the episode who dies to
prove that the situation is serious! I’m leaving NOW.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Commander…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my
crew.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Your crew? What about you?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Begging your Commander’s pardon, sir, but
we cannot launch pods at the moment. Sarris will surely detonate any
objects leaving the ship. Yes sir, he’s</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: There’s nobody here. Jason…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your
crew up here.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: I thank you for your consideration to our
pride, but while my people are talented scientists our attempts to
operate our own technologies under tactical simulation have been
disastrous.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: I have raised Sarris on zeta
frequency.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Uh… Great. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Still, Mathesar, your crew may nonetheless be
helpful in certain-</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: We meet again Commander.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes… Hi Sarris… How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Better than my Lieutenant. He failed to
activate ship’s neutron armor as quickly as I’d hoped on our last
encounter.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Right. Well… Listen, I’m I’m sorry about that
whole… thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding. I’m sure we
can work this out like reasonable people… How’s the uh… … that going to
heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Deliver the device now or I will destroy
your ship.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Listen, I’d like to, but frankly.. I’m not
even sure where it is, or even…</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: You have ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right. You got it. You win. I’ll deliver
it now. Just give me a moment to set it up.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right, now nobody panic, I’ve dealt with
this guy before and believe me, he’s as stupid as he is ugly.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason..</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’re going to fire everything we’ve got at
him, all right?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: JASON…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You just keep pushing those buttons, those
there, send everything at him, okay?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: …Okay</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right. Put me back on with him.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I’m trying to tell you. You ARE on with
him.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Perhaps I am not as stupid as I am ugly,
Commander.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded
okay.’</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I thought It was the “We’re dead” gesture! I
was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Listen, Sarris, you can’t blame me for
trying…</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Of course not…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Guys… Red thingy moving toward the green
thingy. Red thingy moving toward the green thingy!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I think we’re the green thingy.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: A present for you, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Shit. Turn. Gun it’ Get out of-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’ve gotta get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: They’re turning. They’re COMING.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: The ship is sustaining structural
damage.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Guys, we’re sustaining structural damage!…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s as far as it goes!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: They’re still behind us…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We should have a turbo. I’m always saying
“activate turbo boosters”, right?…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Could be this.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Push It. Hold it down.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: The enemy is matching velocity.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The enemy is matching velocity.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: We heard it the first time!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Shit! I’m doing it! I’m repeating the damn
computer!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hi guys. Listen, they’re telling me that the
generators won’t take it, the ship’s breaking apart and all that. Just
FYI.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: We’ve got to stop!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster
down Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You don’t hold a thruster down! It’s for
quick boosts</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Like YOU know?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I remember that sound! That’s a bad sound!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I don’t think that’s a cloud…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mathesar? What is that?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: It’s the Tothian mine field left standing
from the Great War of 12185.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: May I get the check?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The ships are gaining…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Do your best, Tommy…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Could you possibly try not to hit every
single one!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: They’re drifting toward me… I think they’re
magnetic!…</p>
<p><strong>lathe</strong>: Continue forward, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Patience, Lt. . Patience.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’re almost through… Come on… Hold…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: WE’VE HAVE TO STOP!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A
LITTLE!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: NO! WE’RE ALMOST THROUGH!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: DON’T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: WHAT DO IT DO? WHAT DO IT DO?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The engines are dead. We’re drifting.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Are they behind us?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No, I don’t think so… Wait. They’re not but…
Something is. Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Are you all right? Tommy. Where’s Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s broke… Oh God… Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: I’ll take him to medical quarters.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: “Go into the cloud! …</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Alex? Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: To see if there’s a pub.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: …Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage… Left
vector guards, 96% damage… Level 5 structural breaches in quadrants 32,
34, 40, 43, 58…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Computer, what about our engines? Why don’t we
have power?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under
stress.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It’s fractured…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Can it be repaired?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Computer, can it be repaired?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have
to be replaced.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We need another one.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Shit, the Beryllium sphere. That’s bad…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You broke the ship. You broke the bloody
SHIP! I told you you don’t hold down a turbo. You push it once, maybe
twice for a boost but you don’t HOLD it.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere
onboard?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium
sphere onboard?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere
exists onboard.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No, we don’t have an extra Beryllium
sphere.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You know, that’s really getting annoying.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It’s
stupid, but I’m going to DO it. GOT IT?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sure, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: A thousand apologies. We have failed
you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You what?.. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: We have seen you victorious in many more
desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No… Listen, Mathesar. it’s not your fault.
We’re… We’re… …..</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We’re not the people you think we are.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Mathesar, don’t you have television on
your planet? Theater? Films?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: The historical documents of your culture…
Yes, in fact we have begun to</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No not historical documents… They’re not all
historical documents… I mean… surely you don’t think Gilligan’s Island
is a…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Those poor people…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hoo boy…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Does no one on your planet behave in a way
that is contrary to reality?</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Ah. You speak of…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: “Deception…” “Lies.”</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Well… Sort of…</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: We have become aware of these concepts
only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one
thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction… It is a
concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost. But if you are
saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: You are our protectors… Our heroes. You
will save us.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium
on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the
solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I…Well, uh… Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Correct! Gold star for you and a gold star for
you…</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I
have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient
density.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Good luck on your mission, Sir. By
Grabthar’s Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Uh uh! What did we talk about?</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Right… Sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I changed my mind. I want to go back.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: After the big fuss you made about not
getting left behind on the ship?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah, but that’s when I thought maybe was the
crewman that stays on the shin and something is up there and it kills
me, but now I’m thinking I’m the guy who gets killed by some monster
five minutes after we land on the planet…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Guy, you’re not going to get killed on the
planet, okay?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Oh, I’m not? I’m not? Then what’s my last
name?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Your last name.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my
character Isn’t IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I’m going to
DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don’t KNOW
it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Do I? DO I? For all you know I’m just “CREWMAN
#6”! Okay, it’s FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I’m a whole person! I
can’t die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN’T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: See? I’m the hysterical guy who needs to be
slapped, and then I die!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Are we there yet?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Autopilot.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you doing! You don’t just open the
door! It’s an alien planet! Is there air!? You don’t know, do you!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Seems okay.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Which way, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: This way… Wait, no, that way…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You were holding it upside down weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You know, with the makeup and everything1 I
actually thought he was smart for a second.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You think you could do better
“Laredo?”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, watch that “Laredo” shit.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’re screwed… We’re so screwed…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right, let’s all settle down. If we’re
going to get through this we’re going to have to exercise self
control.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Self control? That’s funny coming from the guy
that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the
show!…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Did it ever occur to you that if you had been
a little more supportive you could have held on to me?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I could have held on to YOU! …</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: We re really going to do this HERE?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: How much further?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: About this much.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What’s the scale? Is that ten miles? A
hundred miles?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: THIS much.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s got me it’s got me! See? FIVE MINUTES! I
told you!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Something grabbed me! IT DID.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Easy son. It’s just your imagination. Hang
tough.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You’re playing your good side.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: And note the sucked in gut.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: …Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s the rugged pose.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s it, that’s what’s going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Let’s just pick up the pace a little, shall
we?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There it is. The Beryllium sphere.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Must be some sort of mining facility.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Where are the miners?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Something BAD happened here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Will you relax?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Look at that… Will you LOOK at that… They look
like little children…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Could they be the miners?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Sure. They’re like, three years old.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: MINERS, not MINORS.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You Okay, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t like this… I don’t like this at
all…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh, they’re so cute.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Of course they’re cute NOW. But in a second
they’re going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to
be a million MORE of them!…</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Awwww….. It’s hurt…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Hi!… Hi there little guy…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Jesus, didn’t ANY of you watch the show!?</p>
<p><strong>alien children</strong>: Gorignak… Gorignak…. Nak nak!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Aw, look. They’re helping the hurt one…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I am SO SICK of being right.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Let’s get out of here before one of those
things kills guy.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We gotta get that sphere, or we aren’t going
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right… here’s the plan: First, Fred, we
need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen,
Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere. Any of those things come
back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Why does this sound so familiar?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “Assault on Voltareck III.” Episode… 31 I
think.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’re doing episode 31?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall
of fire.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: How the hell is Fred supposed to project a
hologram?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’re doing episode 31, Jason?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It doesn’t have to be a hologram… Just a
diversion.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter
if we’re doing episode 31 or not?!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: This is ludicrous. Why are you listening
to this man? Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a
uniform?… He’s no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow. No
offense.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You have a better plan, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their
eyes. They’re obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the
forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of
mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it
that way in episode 31.’</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: As I was saying… Fred, we need some sort of
diversion. Some sort of Hologram or optical illusion or…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: A hologram…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Never mind, Fred….</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, no… I’ll think on it…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason, look.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: They’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Where’d they go? Back inside?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Nobody was WATCHING?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy,
set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they
come back.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What kind of signal?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Okay, I’ll do this… “Caw Caw!”</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Tommy, we have these…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, right, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You have no idea what a perimeter is, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Not a clue. You?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I think he just likes pointing at things.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: How does the rolling help, actually?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It helps.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Where’s your gun?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: “It helps.”</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Those blue things ate everybody here?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: It doesn’t make sense… Surely they could
have fortified the compound against those creatures…</p>
<p><strong>miner</strong>: Gorignak!… Gorignak!…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Anybody want to wait around to find out what
a “Gorignak” is?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Clenched jaw…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Will you stop RIDING ME?!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I know what it is… I know what it is… It’s not
what’s ON the planet. It IS the planet…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: There’s a life force here. The blue things… Did
you see how they moved? Careful. Quiet. Like they didn’t want something
DISTURBED….</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: C’mon, push! Never give up, never
surrender!</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Oh shut up!..</p>
<p><strong>tommy on vox</strong>: Caw! Caw!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Spare me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sorry Guys… It just went off.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Good work, Tommy. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Don’t look back. DO NOT look back.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You go first! There’s no time!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be
the hero, don’t you?… Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once!
Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn’t possibly-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Tommy, I’m in, push go now!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the
pod!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I can’t… It’s on autopilot!…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where
is he?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Down there.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Oh right, of course… It’s always about
YOU, isn’t it?!</p>
<p><strong>demon #1</strong>: What do you suppose it is?</p>
<p><strong>demon #2</strong>: I don’t know. Strange, it looks like a
child.</p>
<p><strong>demon #1</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>demon #2</strong>: Hit it with a rock. Then we’ll eat it.</p>
<p><strong>demon</strong>: Gorignak…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We got the Sphere but the Commander’s down
there with a bunch of cannibals! Teb, reset the pod, we’re going
back.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That thing’s not going to get us down there
fast enough. Face it, he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know…
“Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!”</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: …The digital conveyor.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Of course… We’ll just zap him up with the
digital conveyor!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Do we have one of those, Teb?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You said “the Commander.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Back there. You said “the Commander is
down there with a bunch of cannibals.”</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I heard it too.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Is this really the most important thing we
could be talking about right now?</p>
<p><strong>demons</strong>: Gorignak… Gorignak.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason.. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes. Yes, I’m here!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Thank God. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah. But I’ve got Gorignak staring me in the
face. I think I can take it though…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason, we’re going to use the digital conveyer
to get you out of there.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: The digital conveyer? You mean I’m going to
get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’ll take my chances with Gorignak.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason, we’ve got to get you out of there. It’s
perfectly safe, isn’t it, Teb?</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: It has never been successfully tested.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What? What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Nothing. Hold please.</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: Theoretically the mechanism is fully
operational. However, it was built to accommodate your anatomy, not
ours. Our actual hands are six fingered and jointed ninety degrees to
yours. But now that Sergeant Chen is here he can operate it… It was
designed watching his motions from the historical records.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well I mean I can’t… I can supervise of
course, but…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Jason, we’re going to test it.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay… On what?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How about the pig-lizard?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: I’m sorry. It is very exciting to see the
master at the controls. The operation of the conveyer is more art than
science.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I heard something. A squeal.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh no. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: But… the animal is inside out.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I heard that! It’s INSIDE OUT!</p>
<p><strong>teb</strong>: And It exploded!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What? Did I just hear that It came back
INSIDE CUT, and ’then It EXPLODED? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Hold please.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they
still chanting for the pig lizard?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Turn on the translation circuit.</p>
<p><strong>demons</strong>: ROCK… ROCK… ROCK…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jason?… I don’t think the pig lizard was
Gorignak…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh darn.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Guys, digitize me…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Guys…?!!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: C’ non Fred… They based it on YOUR hand
movements.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: All my professional life they’d say “can you
ride a horse” Fred? And I’d say “Of course, since I was a boy!” “Can you
fence Fred?” “Funny you should ask, I’ve won six international
competitions.” I learned never to say I can’t do this. You don’t get the
part if you say I can’t do this. But this is life or death! May God
forgive me Jason but I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Fred’s no good, Jason. You’re going to
have to kill it</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: KILL IT? Well I’m open to ideas!…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It doesn’t have eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The throat, the mouth… Its vulnerable
spots.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s a ROCK. It doesn’t HAVE vulnerable
spots!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I know… You contruct a weapon. Look around, can
you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.’</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You’re my advisor,
advise me!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: … . Well you have to figure out what it
wants… What’s its motivation?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn’t HAVE
motivation!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: That’s your problem. You were never
serious about the caraft… “I’m a rock… I just want to be a rock… Still.
Peaceful.. Tranquil..” …“Oh, but what’s this? Something’s making noise…
No, not noise, no… MOVEMENT. VIBRATIONS. Make the vibrations stop, they
go straight into me like a knife!… I must CRUSH the thing that makes the
vibrations…”</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Am I crazy, or do you actually have something
there?</p>
<p><strong>87 on the planet - 87</strong>: The rubble RE-FORMS and the
monster EMERGES, even LARGER than before! It begins to make a beeline
for a perplexed Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But I’m not moving, I… Oh no. My
heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Fred? Fred, can you hear me? You’ve got to do
this… It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, I’ll kill you. .</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Listen Fred. You did this for four years on
the show. You can do it now… Put your hands on the controls..</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I don’t know… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins.
Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an
actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional
consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You’re Mr. Dependable… You can do
this.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You worked with Hopkins? I worship
Hopkins.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Digitize me, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>89 the monster smashes down his fist right down onto
jason….</strong>: at the very moment he digitizes. The fist goes right
through the scattering blocks. Everybody on ship holds their breath and
watches the..</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I see you managed to get your shirt
off.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: As good as Hopkins?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hopkins can’t drink your bathwater Fred.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right folks, let’s get the hell out of
here…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mathesar, we’re back up and on our way to the
command deck. Mathesar? Come in Mathesar? Teb? Quellek? What’s going on?
Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: NO NO NO.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’ve got to get out of here. C’mon,
hurry</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Listen Sarris, just hold on, just-</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: If you cannot walk, Commander, then I
suggest you crawl.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Commander. Thank God you’re alive… Now you
will face justice, Sarris.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: At every turn you demonstrate the necessity
for your extermination. The qualities of your species… Ridiculous
optimism, like little children. Building, always building. But what you
spend years to create, I take from you in days. Do you wish to save this
man’s life, Commander? And the life of your crew?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Then tell me one thing… What does it do, the
device? The Omega 13.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Is it a bomb? A booby trap? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Stop, please! I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Prepare a tear harness for the female…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No! I swear I don’t know! Please!</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Do you think I’m a fool? That the Commander
does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But I’m not! I… I’m not the Commander!</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Wait. What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Please, don’t hurt them, it’s not their
fault. I’m not the Commander, I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Explain -</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Gwen. The show. There’s no choice. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Computer, play the historical records of the
GALAXY QUEST missions.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Oh, this is wonderful. Wonderful. I treated
you as a foe, but no… You have done greater damage to these poor fools
than I ever could have. Bravo!… Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Tell him. This is a moment I will treasure.
Explain who you really are.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: My name is Jason Nesmith. I’m an actor. We’re
all actors.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Our dimwitted friends don’t understand the
concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these
scientists.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We pretend…</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Simpler.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We.. We lie.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Yes… You understand THAT, don’t you,
Mathesar?…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m not a Commander, there is no National
Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: But there it is!…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: A model, only as big as this.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: But… Inside, I have seen-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our
Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was
Christmas lights… Decorations. It’s all a fake. I’m not him… I’m a
nothing. A nobody.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: But…Why?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s difficult to… On our planet we pretend
in order to… entertain.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That’s how I make my living. Pretending to be
somebody else. Pretending to be Commander Peter Quincy Taggart… I’m… I’m
so sorry Mathesar…</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Now you know. This entire world you’ve
concocted. All based on nothing. Your beliefs… your hopes… All a dream.
A wisp of smoke. Now there is only pain.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning
to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what
is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to
obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.</p>
<p><strong>lathe</strong>: The core could be hardwired to overload
without much effort.</p>
<p><strong>mathesar</strong>: Sarris. What about my men?</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: I guess an actor is not the same as a
Commander after all.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Release them, Sergeant… Into space.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Core overload. Emergency shut down
overridden. Core implosion estimated in nine minutes…</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: You two. Go.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Well, how does it feel, Jason? Was it
worth it? Hundreds of innocents to die because of you… How does it
feel?</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Get in. Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Hundreds dead, all so you could play at
being the Commander.’ You’ve murdered us all you egomaniacal
sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Shut up.’ Just shut up you purple skinned
monstronsity,</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hmmm. . A little sticky. I’ll get one of my
boys up here with a can of WD-40.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: “Purple skinned monstrosity…?”</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I was staying in character. “Egomaniacal
sonofabitch?”</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Sense memory. I see you got to win the
fight…</p>

<p><strong>jason</strong>: Go on, give it a try, Gwen.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: computer, shut own the core.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Unable. Memory checksum invalid.
Core systems hardware damaged.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: All right guys… Uh… Gwen and I are going to
have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy
need to get that air valve back on. Alex, see if you can get the prison
doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can’t get the oxygen back in
time.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jason? What about me? What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Practice driving, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Practice driving?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: So… We get to shut down the neutron
reactor?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Uh… I hate to break it to you Jason, but I
don’t know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a
Learning Annex course I don’t know about, I’m pretty sure you don’t know
how to shut down a neutron reactor either.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No I don’t. But I know somebody who does.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mom</strong>: Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mother, I’m quite busy as you can see. The
“C” rings on my booster unit came broken In the mail.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mom</strong>: I’m sorry. - made brownies.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mother, I’m very busy. Well, maybe one.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hello?… Hello is anyone there?…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Hello? BRANDON</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: This Is Jason Nesmith. I play Commander Peter
Quincy Taggart of the USEA PROTECTOR.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped
into each other on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Oh… Oh, I see. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Brandon, I remember you from the convention,
right?… You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship,
and I spoke sharply to you…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Yes, I know, and I want you to know I
thought about what you said… I know you meant it constructively but…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s okay. Listen-</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … But I want you to know that I am not a
complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It’s just a TV
show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital
conveyor… I mean, obviously it’s all just a-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s real, Brandon. All of it, It’s real.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I knew it!… I KNEW it!…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and
we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>lathe</strong>: General, your transport is ready for
departure.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Sir, it’s you Thank Ipthar!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Quellek. What are you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: I avoided capture using the Mak’tar stealth
haze. Where is everyone?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Come with me. I’ll explain on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay we’re in C deck hallway 5. What now?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Okav, there’s a haton on the port wall. It
leads to a system of utility corridors through the bowels of the
shop.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There’s no hatch. There’s no hatch!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Wait… Jason, Here!…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay, we got it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Okay, you can go on in… I’m going to get
Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Hi Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a
level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and
shut it down before it overloads.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’ve got the utility systems walkthrough,
right?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I have sectors 1-28. I think Hector has the
upper levels.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: We’d better get everybody online. And Kyle,
Stop downloading porn. Your frame rate is unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I’m not downloading porn!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay, sector 38… 39… 40. This is it. The
environmental systems are in here. All we have to do is shut off the
valve to the barracks…</p>
<p><strong>both tommys</strong>: Pedal to the metal, Commander….</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Okay, now left at the next turn… Past the
oxygen units. Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter
vent…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay… Okay, now what.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Now make a right, you’ll see a doorway that
opens on the central manufacturing facility. The bowels of the ship.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Commander, do you have a camera? I’d die to
see this in person… All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a
wall here… I don’t know why they didn’t show the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’d never have the budget for this.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Okay, so do you see a door marked “CORE
UNIT?” Should be down at the far end to your left.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Okay, that’s where you want to be.</p>
<p><strong>auellex</strong>: They’re dying!</p>
<p><strong>allxander</strong>: Here. Help me tear this down, we can use
it as a battering ram.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Don’t worry, Quellek, it’ll be okay…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We’ve got to get that valve turned off. Their
oxygen Is almost gone…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Listen, I’ll go in, create a distraction. have
this… may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s suicide.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m just a glorified extra, Fred. I’m a dead
man anyway. If I’m going to die, I’d rather go out a hero than a
coward.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Maybe you’re the plucky comic relief, you ever
think of that?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Besides, just had a really interesting
idea.</p>
<p><strong>transport chief</strong>: Sir, the FALCON THREE Is launched
and away, course set for Xactor Minor. FALCON ONE ahead. Four minutes to
core overload.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Good… Good… All is in its place.</p>
<p><strong>transport chief</strong>: General, I have just received word
that the Commander of the PROTECTOR and his command crew have escaped
custody. Their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Find them.</p>
<p><strong>lathe</strong>: But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not
reversible…</p>
<p><strong>sarris</strong>: Find them.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’ve cleared the robot arms. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>katelyn</strong>: Okay, Brandon, as I calculate it the
shortest route is down the ladder near the quark accelerators.</p>
<p><strong>other nerds</strong>: I concur. She’s right. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: High five, Katelyn.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Brandon.. Just in case I die, there’s
something I have to know…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Yes Commander?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What does the Omega 13 do?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Well, that’s the big question, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s been the subject of an extremely
heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter
collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a
chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No, I am of the firm belief that in reality
it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all
molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to
activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: How did you come to that conclusion?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: My cousin’s boyfriend’s sister went out
with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman. He’s seen it
13 times…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: As you know I strenuously disagree with this
theory, Brandon. if all molecules were rearranged, then everyone would
be back in time 13 seconds rendering the device useless.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay guys… Guys?</p>
<p><strong>katelyn</strong>: No because the brain of the person who
triggers the Omega 13 is not affected, so THAT person still has his
memory after the time jump. And everything is as it was, a chance to
redeem a single mistake or misstep.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Thank you, Katelyn. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>katelyn</strong>: You’re welcome, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: BRANDON! TIME TO GO!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Yes Commander… All right, you’re almost
there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: “The chompers?”</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh, fuck THAT.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Brandon, HOW?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hollister, do you have the sequence
yet?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: Okay, the pattern is two.. two… four…
two… three… eight… two…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re sure they repeat like that? It’s
sort of extremely important.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What IS that thing? It serves no useful
purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a
CATWALK!?.’</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Gwen…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We shouldn’t have to DO this! It makes NO
LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Because it was on the show!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Well forget it! I’m not going. This episode
was badly written!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to
go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me
when the first crusher hits the bottom…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay, now. But-</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Wait two seconds then go.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No, wait, are you-</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Lt. Madison, GO.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Shit! Go!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: GO Commander.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Go. They’re off again.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Up.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What? Up?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Berithium lava coming through. Use the
handholds above you.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Whoever wrote this episode should DIE.</p>
<p><strong>123 darkness 123</strong>: Jason and Gwen run through pitch
blackness.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What the hell?… Brandon, Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know. This part of the ship is
completely undocumented.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Great… Just great.’</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: This should be Interesting…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s the simple things In life you
treasure.</p>
<p><strong>rock monster</strong>: Ah, sweet tranquility at last.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: Sir! The pressure. It’s normalizing.</p>

<p><strong>alien #1</strong>: We are saved! He has saved us.’</p>

<p><strong>alexander</strong>: It’s just not fair.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Okay, Quellek, let’s get back to the
command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek’s chest
turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: I’m… I’m shot.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Quellek… Quellek!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Not so bad. We’ll get you to medical
quarters. You’re going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: I… I don’t think I’m going to make it
Sir…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: No, don’t talk like that, son. We’re
going to get you fixed up.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: … It has been my greatest honor to serve
with you. LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning. I
have been blessed. Sir, I… I…</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Don’t speak, Quellek.</p>
<p><strong>quellek</strong>: You’ll forgive my impertinence, sir, but
even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father
to me.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Quellek… By Grabthar’s hammer, by the
