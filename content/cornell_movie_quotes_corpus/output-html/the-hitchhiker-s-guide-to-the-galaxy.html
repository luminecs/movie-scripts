id="the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy">the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy</h1>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: It is an important and popular fact
that things are not always what they seem.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: For instance, on the planet Earth, man
had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying
the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact,
entirely accurate.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The second most intelligent creatures
were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the
impending destruction of the planet Earth. They had made many attempts
to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were
misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for
tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own
means.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The last ever dolphin message was
misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-
backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the “Star-Spangled
Banner” but in fact the message was this… “So long and thanks for all
the fish.”</p>
<p><strong>voice on radio</strong>: …as well as Sea World Orlando and
San Diego reporting their dolphins have mysteriously disappeared
overnight.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What do you mean he’s gone out to lunch? You
just said he was still at breakfast!</p>
<p><strong>prosser</strong>: Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can’t lie in
front of the bulldozers forever.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m game. We’ll see who rusts first.</p>
<p><strong>prosser</strong>: This bypass has got to be built and it’s
going to be built. You should have made your protest months ago.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The first I heard of it was when a workman
came yesterday. I asked if he’d come to clean the windows, and he said
he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me right away of course.
First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he
told me.</p>
<p><strong>prosser</strong>: Look. These plans have been on display at
the planning office now for a year.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: On display? I had to go down to a
cellar!</p>
<p><strong>prosser</strong>: That’s the display department.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I eventually found them in the bottom of a
locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door
saying ‘beware of the leopard’.</p>
<p><strong>prosser</strong>: Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage
that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>prosser</strong>: None at all.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Arthur!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ford?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Arthur! There you are. Here drink and eat with
me. We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Er, um…now’s not the best time, Ford They’re
going to demolish my home,</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Whoa. You already know? How?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh. When you say “they” you mean they. Got it.
Listen, I gotta tell you something important, and I gotta tell you
now.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: But what about my house?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: C’mon. Let’s go to the pub. He said they won’t
destroy your house until they’ve finished the beers.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Can we trust him?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’d trust him to the end of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And how far’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: About twelve minutes away.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Six pints of bitter. And quickly. The world’s
about to end.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, when does he get back from lunch? Or
is he going straight out for tea?!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: This is shaping up to be a crap day.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: It’s about to get a lot crappier.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: There you are, six pints.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Keep the change. You’ve got ten minutes to
spend it.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Three? At lunchtime?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Very deep. You should send that in to the
Reader’s Digest. They’ve got a page for people like you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Drink up.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Why three pints?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Muscle relaxant. And eat these. You’ll need
the salt.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What’s going on. Ford?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What would you say if I told you I wasn’t
really from Guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity
of Eetelgeuse?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Why, is it the sort of thing you’re likely
to say?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Remember when we met? That car was racing
toward me, I was trying to greet it, you pushed me out of the way?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Didn’t you find it a little strange that I was
trying to shake hands with a car?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I assumed you were drunk.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I thought cars were the dominant life form. I
was trying to introduce myself.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And that’s why you’re named after a
discontinued car from the seventies?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You saved my life that day. Now I’m saving
yours.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: This must be Thursday. I never could get the
hang of Thursdays.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Look, if it’s about your house…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, it’s not that. It’s….</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I found
her, and then I let her get away. You remember that fancy dress party I
told you about?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: This isn’t a long story, is it? We’ve only got
six minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Okay. Talk and drink. Fancy dress party.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: At that flat in Islington. I told you about
it. Last week, remember?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I can’t bear those sort of parties, didn’t
want to go, would have much rather stayed home and, I don’t know, brush
the dog. Anything. But there I was – and then, there she was…</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m Arthur. Arthur Dent.</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: No, I mean who are you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um… Livingston,
I presume. Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on
short notice.</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: You’re the first person who’s got it right.
Everyone keeps calling me Sherlock.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Really? I thought the beagle made it rather
obvious.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Really? I thought the beagle made it rather
obvious.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and beautiful,
and brilliant. Four or five degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics,
another in biology…</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: I’ve got so many degrees I am officially
unemployable. Let’s drink to that!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And just as I was asking myself, “Why is
this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day, out
of nowhere she says…</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: Let’s go somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There’s a lovely
little cafe around the corner…</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: I was thinking Madagascar.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Is that a new club on Dean Street?</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: No. It’s a country. Off the coast of
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go then.
Good God, you’re serious.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well…that’s…an extraordinary proposition.
But…I can’t just up and go. What about my job?</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: Quit. Get a new one when we return.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I can’t just…what about my house? Who would
feed my dog?</p>
<p><strong>tricia</strong>: Bring him with.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: He’s a Welsh Collie. He’d feel all out of
place in Madagascar.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: You don’t want to go to Madagascar.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hi. I’m Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the
Galaxy – of course, you probably already know that. I’m headed for a
lost and distant planet. Would you like to see my spaceship?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I went to refresh our drinks. When I came
back, she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: “Would you like to see my spaceship?”
Really, what sort of chat up line is that?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: More popular than you’d think.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’ve left messages, sent letters… It’s like
she’s vanished off the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, it happens. Speaking of… We’ve got two
minutes. So drink up.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: My house!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: A round for everyone, on me.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You really think the world’s going to end?
Shouldn’t we lie down or put a bag over our heads or something?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: If you want.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Will it help?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Last orders, then?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ships from a Vogon Constructor Fleet. I picked
up their signal this morning.</p>
<p><strong>ford {cont’d}</strong>: Here. You’ll need this.</p>
<p>****: People of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic
Hyperspace planning council.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: As you are probably aware, plans for the
development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building
of a hyperspace express route through your star system…</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: …and, unfortunately, your planet is one of
those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than
two of your Earth minutes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Hello! Can you hear us? Please
respond!</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: There’s no point in acting all surprised
about it. The plans and demolition orders have been on display at your
local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years,
so you’ve had plenty of time to lodge formal complaints.</p>
<p><strong>vogon captain</strong>: What do you mean you’ve never been to
Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven’s sake mankind, it’s only four light
years away you know. I’m sorry, but if you can’t be bothered to take an
interest in local affairs that’s your own lookout.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: Apathetic bloody planet, I’ve no sympathy at
all. Energize the demolition beams.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: Detonate.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is
a wholly remarkable book…</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: …Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly
the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing
corporations of Ursa Minor.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME
CARE OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY,
and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid’s trilogy of philosophical
blockbusters,</p>
<p><strong>where god went wrong, some more of god’s</strong>: GREATEST
MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: In many of the more relaxed
civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker’s
Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the
standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it has many
omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly
inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two
important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has
the words “DON’T PANIC” printed in large friendly letters on its
cover.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So you’re not from Guilford, which would
explain the accent – which I’ve always wondered about…and you’re not an
out of work actor – but rather a writer for this…this…book thing.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I don’t feel well. I need a cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Here. Eat these. If you’ve never been through
a transmat beam before you’ve probably lost some salt and protein.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: If I asked where we were would I regret</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We’re safe. For now.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We’re in a storage hold in one of the ships of
the Vogon constructor fleet …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Obviously some strange usage of the word
safe I wasn’t previously aware of.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Tell me you’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Okay. I’m joking.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And do a reassuring little laugh.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Now tell me where we really are.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: In the storage hold of a Vogon constructor
ship.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Get me home. Ford.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Home? Arthur…your home… is…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh God - it was demolished! I’ve got to
reach my lawyer! He must be back from lunch by now…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You don’t remember, do you? Okay. I’ve got
something to tell you. It ain’t gonna be easy, but you’re gonna have to
just deal, okay?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Good god. Is this really the interior of a
flying saucer?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah. Why?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, it’s a bit squalid isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey man, you’re in denial.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Blown up? BLOWN UP?! Couldn’t you have done
something?!!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I did. I saved you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: But there’s six billion other people.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And all those ants.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, but ants aren’t exactly people!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And now you’re thinking like a Vogon. I saved
your life, okay? Which makes us even. Next thing.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: It’s a tough galaxy. You want to survive out
here, you really gotta know where your towel is. Now gimme a hand over
here.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Careful, it’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We’ve got to get off this ship before the
Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers. Which is why they make ships
with walls that won’t allow the Sub-Etna signal to pass through. So
we’ve got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride.
Pull.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What’s a Vogon?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ask the guide. Say “Vogons.”</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: “Vogons.”</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Vogons.</p>
<p><strong>character, history, how to have fun with, how to
annoy,</strong>: WHAT TO AVOID. Arthur touches CHARACTER.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Vogons are one of the most unpleasant
races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic,
officious and callous. They wouldn’t even lift a finger to save their
own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without
orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found,
subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat
for three months and recycled as fire-lighters.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The best way to get a drink out of a
Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: On no account should you allow a Vogon
to read poetry to you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: They can’t think, they can’t imagine, most of
them can’t even spell. They just run things. And if we don’t get a ride
soon, you won’t b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the
Vogons can be. They’ve destroyed a planet today, that always makes them
a little feisty.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: It can’t be gone. It can’t be! Earth!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Earth.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Harmless.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: That’s it? That’s all this idiotic book has
to say about my home? “Harmless?”</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the
Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book’s microprocessors.
No one knew much about Earth. That’s why I was there. To expand the
entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What does it say now?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Mostly harmless.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ahhh, what the hell is that?!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Here. Put this in your ear.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Argh! What’s happening…?</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: This is your captain speaking, so stop
whatever you’re doing and pay attention!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: The fish. It’s translating for you.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: According to our instruments we have
unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended
and…</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: …and this is not a taxi service for
degenerate freeloaders.</p>
<p><strong>vogon guard</strong>: Resistance is useless!</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The Babelfish is small, yellow,
leechlike, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing
unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies
to the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is
that if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything
said to you in any language.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable
thing that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved in the
Universe purely by chance that many thinkers have chosen to see this as
a final clinching proof of the NON-existence of God.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The argument goes something like this…
“I refuse to prove that I exist,” says God, “for proof denies faith, and
without faith I am nothing.”</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: “But,” says Man, “the Babelfish is a
dead give-away. It proves you exist, and so therefore you don’t. QED.”
“Oh dear,” says God, “I hadn’t thought of that,” and promptly vanishes
in a puff of logic.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Most leading theologians claim that
this argument is a load of dingo’s kidneys but that didn’t stop Oolon
Colluphid from making a small fortune when he used it as the central
theme of his best-selling book,</p>
<p><strong>vogon guard</strong>: Resistance is useless!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ford…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Don’t panic. If we’re lucky, they’ll throw us
out into space.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And if we’re unlucky?</p>
<p><strong>a strange and lethal looking device descends from
the</strong>: CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the
device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a gunky trough and
smashes it with a hammer – BLAM!</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: Oh freddled gruntbuggly! Thy suppurations are
to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the
third worst in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The second worst is that of the Azgoths
of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent
of his poem “Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One
Midsummer Morning,” four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging,
and the President of the Mid- Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by
gnawing one of his own legs off.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts with
my blurglecruncheaon, see if I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The absolute worst poetry was written
by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix. It involved decaying swans.
Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: So, Earthlings, I present you with a simple
choice. Either die in the vacuum of space, or – tell what you thought of
my poem.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Actually…I rather liked it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Good tact. Run with it.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Um…some of the words I didn’t understand,
but I found the imagery quite effective.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: Continue. . .</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which
seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the
humanity…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Vogonity!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: … Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet’s
soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to
sublimate, er…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: … whatever it was …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: … the poem was about.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I think you just saved my life again.</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: An astute analysis. Very impressive. Throw
them off the ship.</p>
<p><strong>vogon guard</strong>: Resistance is useless!</p>
<p><strong>jeltz</strong>: Hmph. “Counterpoint the surrealism of the
underlying metaphor…” Death’s too good for them.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So this is it? We’re going to die?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yes. No, wait! What’s this switch? No, it’s
nothing. We are going to die.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You know, it’s at times like this, when I’m
trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die
of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I’d listened to what my
mother told me when I was young.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why? What did you she tell you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I don’t know. I didn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’re sweating.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: “Space…” says the introduction to the
Hitchhikers Guide, “…is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how
vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a
long way down the road to the market, but that’s just peanuts compared
to space…” and so on.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: It also says that if you hold a lung
full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about
thirty seconds – but with space being really big and all, the chances of
being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1
against…</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: …which, by a staggering coincidence, is
also the telephone number of the Islington flat where Arthur once went
to a fancy dress party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed
to connect with.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Two to the power of one hundred
thousand to one against and falling…</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Two to the power of ten thousand to
one against and falling.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ford…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I think I’m a sofa.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I think I know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Five to one against and falling…</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Four to one against and falling…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …and of course, the top story is still the
sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship Heart of
Gold last week, stolen at the launch ceremony by none other than
Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: So, in the name of the people and freedom
and, I dunno, democracy and stuff like that, I hereby declare this ship
officially stolen!</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Three to one…two to one…</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Probability factor of one to one…we have
normality, I repeat we have normality. Anything you still can’t cope
with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for
soon.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey. Do you mind? I can’t hear.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Can we put your ego aside for one moment?
Something important has happened.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: If there’s anything more important than my
ego on this ship, I want it caught and shot now.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …the question everyone seems to be asking
is, has the Big Z finally flipped? We asked his private brain care
Specialist, Gag Halfrunt…</p>
<p><strong>gag halfrrunt</strong>: Vell, Zaphod’s just zis guy, you know
–</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: We have a couple of hitchhikers in our
receiving bay.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I didn’t pick them up. The ship did.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: When you engaged the Improbability
Drive.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I didn’t engage the drive.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z
Alpha – where you picked me up.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: No. Just very, very improbable.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I don’t have time for this! We’ve got the
police of half the Galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers?!
Okay, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good
thinking, eh?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Don’t. I’ll send Marvin. Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I think you ought to know I’m feeling very
depressed.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: We have something to take your mind off
things.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It won’t work, I have an exceptionally large
mind.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I know. Go down to the number two entry
bay and bring the two aliens up here.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Just that?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I won’t enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: She’s not asking you to enjoy it. Just do it
will you?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: All right. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m not getting you down at all am I?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: No, no, Marvin, it’s fine really. It’s
just part of life.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Life. Don’t talk to me about life.</p>
<p><strong>door</strong>: Mmmmmyaaahhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>vogon captain</strong>: Commander Kwaltz. We’ve located the
spaceship Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox. Sector ZZ9 Plural Z
Alpha. Requesting hyperspace clearance.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Hold your position, captain, until clearance
is granted.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Get me the vice-president.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Hyperspace permission granted, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Now this is more like my idea of a
spaceship. Look at all these buttons…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>door</strong>: Thank you for using this door. I’ve enjoyed
opening for you. Hhmmyaahh…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Ghastly, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ve been ordered to take you up to the
bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to take
you up to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? - ’cause I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>door</strong>: What a pleasure it is to open for you. I will
gladly close for you now.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: “All the doors in this spacecraft have a
cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you,
and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well
done.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Hateful, isn’t it? You can thank the
Marketing Division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation for building
robots with GPP.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: “Genuine People Personalities.” I’m a
personality prototype. You can tell can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Er. . .</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Sorry, did I say something wrong? Pardon me
for breathing, which I never do anyway, so I don’t know why I even
bother to say it. Oh god, I’m so depressed.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: And then I’ve got this terrible pain in all
the diodes down my left side. I’ve asked for them to be replaced but no
one ever listens.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Really? Wonder why?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Probably because he’s so negative.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, I know. I was being…never mind.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ve brought the aliens. Don’t thank me or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or just
fall apart where I’m standing?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I wasn’t talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zaphod?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Ixxie? It is you! IXXIE!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Praxibetel Ix, you zarking hoopy! What the
hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I don’t know! Just stuck out the thumb and
here I am.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: That is so you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And look at you! President? Last time I saw
you, you were a beach bum.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Is it a great galaxy or what? I still can’t
believe this. Ixxie! Here!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, it’s Ford now.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: My name. It’s Ford Prefect. Picked it up on
Earth. Sorta grew on me.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Okay “Ford” – you zarking frood.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh, this is Arthur. Arthur, this is Zaphod
Beeblebrox. My cousin? Semi-half brother?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: He shares three of the same mothers as
me.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: We’ve met.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Have we? Sorry. I’ve got a terrible memory
for species.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey, hon. Come here. You won’t believe this.
Ix…um, sorry…“Ford”…this is…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Tricia McMillan?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I can’t believe this…I’ve been looking…and
you’re here? I went to get wine and…</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I know. And it was rude to just leave, but
I told you I wanted to get away, and he had a spaceship parked outside,
well, honestly – I assumed you were a sort of stay-at-home-and-read-a
book type. But you’re here…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Actually – I am that type. But…well you do
know what happened, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: –Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride,
and here we all are. Now, enough small talk, Trill. We’re on the run,
remember? I stole a ship?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: We’re having a bit of a chat if you don’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: You blew it with her, Earthman, so
shut up or I’ll kick you in the gones!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: There’s the Zaphod I remember.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: You should teach your pal a lesson,
Ford. He’s a guest on my ship.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I thought you said you stole it.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Fine. Get technical.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I feel like a bloody idiot. I’ve spent all
week looking for Tricia McMillan and that isn’t even your name.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: It is my name. I shortened it.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Trillian…!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, I’m still Arthur. Just plain average
one-headed doesn’t-own-a-space ship Arthur. Sorry to disappoint.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: A little help over here?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: They’re after us! Fire a gun! Launch
a missile! DO SOME DAMAGE!</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Computer?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hi, guys, this is Eddie your shipboard
computer and I just know I’m gonna get a bundle of kicks out of any
program you want to run through me.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Can you identify our pursuers?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’d be happy to! Stand by, please. Hey, guys,
I’m just pleased as punch to report that it’s a fleet of a hundred Vogon
Battle Destroyers. You must be super important to warrant such an
effort, and gee am I impressed. They’re sending a message. I’d be super
happy to play it.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Fine! Play it!! This people
personality thing is gonna drive me nuts! Can’t you change it?</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: This is Vice President Questular Rontok.
I am speaking to the kidnapper of the President. Surrender your stolen
vessel at once or we will take action as defined and permitted by
Section 1.8 of the Galactic Interstellar Space Bi-Laws.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Leap to hyperspace!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you we
need proper authorization before entering a hyperspace expressway.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Or else what? They’ll send a hundred
and one ships? DO it!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Brace yourself. This is a bit like being
drunk.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What’s so bad about being drunk?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ask a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Did they have proper hyperspace
authorization?</p>
<p><strong>vogon worker</strong>: No, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Add that to their list of offences! Blatant
disregard for protocol.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: You do realize he did what he did because
he knew this is what you would do.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President. And
they are made to be followed.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: Don’t you think this many ships is a bit,
oh I don’t know – excessive?</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: The provisions are clear. Under subsection
37a these are the forces we deploy to protect the president in the case
of an attempted or actual kidnapping-</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: – and these are the forces we deploy to
apprehend any intentional or actual kidnapper.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: You are aware, Commander, that the
President kidnapped himself.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Hence…</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: Do you have any idea how ridiculous this
is?</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: I don’t have ideas Mr. Vice President. I
just do what I do.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Damn, I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: So – you along for the ride or am I dropping
you somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Depends. Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Into the pages of history, cousin. And when
you see what I’m about to show you, you’ll beg me to take you with
us.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Normally I would say “I’ll live,” but given
the circumstances… Is there any tea on this spaceship?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey, apeman. Earthman. I’m sorry, what was
your name again?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Right. No hard feelings, okay? And sorry to
hear about your planet, but don’t mention it to the girl because if you
do I’ll…I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: I’ll pull your spleen out through
your ass!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Two heads. Interesting choice.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Apparently you can’t be President with a
whole brain.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: So you carved it up?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Yes – I think. And I think I did it in such
a way that it wouldn’t be detected by the Government screening tests –
or by me. So, what’s so secret that I can’t let anybody know I know it,
not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is– –I
don’t know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and that’s when I
realized I had this.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I suppose I should have said it resembles
tea.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So two heads is what does it for a girl,
then? I mean, if I’d had two heads. Or three?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Or your own space ship.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Anything else he’s got two of?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Come on, Arthur, don’t be like that.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, what am I supposed to be like? Green?
Bleeping? What?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it
hurt?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, I suppose it wouldn’t..</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I mean…</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I might have an aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Hey. What are they doing in there?</p>
<p>****: They were from my lab at university. Odd…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So all that’s left is me and you, “mostly
harmless,” and two lab rats.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Look, there’s something I should tell
you…</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Showtime, Trill!</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Can it keep? You might want to see
this.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: –and when I saw what I’m about to show you,
that’s when I realized why I did what I did to my brain – or it least, I
think that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: What is this great task for which I,
Deep Thought, the second greatest computer of all time have been called
into existence?</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: Your task, O computer…</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Hang on. Did you say second greatest?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Second greatest. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: But we designed you to be the greatest
computer so you could…</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: You’re not talking about the Milliard
Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a
millisecond?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere
abacus, mention it not.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could
argue all four legs off an Arcturan Megadonkey, but only I could
persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Then what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: I am the greatest computer you are
able to design without my help. Which, one day, you are going to
need.</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: Let’s just ask the question.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We want
you to tell us – the Answer.</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: The Answer…to what?</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: You know. The answer. To Life…the
Universe…Everything.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: We’d really like an answer. Something simple.
Can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: The Ultimate Question of Life, the
Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an answer. But I’ll have to think
about it.</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Return to this place in exactly… seven
and a half million years.</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill &amp; fook</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: No, no. There’s more. They go back.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Seven and a half million years later?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Deep Thought. Do you have…</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: An answer for you? Yes. I have.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: There really is an answer?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Yes. There really is one.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: Can you tell us what it is?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Yes. Though I don’t think you’re going
to like it.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Doesn’t matter! We must know it!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: You’re really not going to like
it.</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Tell us!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Alright. The answer to the ultimate
question …</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: Yes …</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: … of Life, the Universe, and
Everything …</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: … is …</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Yes …!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Forty two.</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: I checked it thoroughly. It would have
been simpler, of course, to have known what the actual question was.</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: But it was the Question. The Ultimate
Question!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Yes, but what actually is it?</p>
<p><strong>fook</strong>: Everything! You know … just EVERYTHING!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: That’s not a question. Only when you
know what the actual question will you know what the answer means.</p>
<p><strong>lunkwill</strong>: Give us the Ultimate Question then!!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: I can’t. But there is one who can. A
computer that is to come after me, one that I will design. A computer to
calculate the Ultimate Question, one of such infinite complexity that
life itself will form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves
shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to
navigate its ten million year program. I shall design this computer for
you. And it shall be called…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’re looking for the Ultimate Question?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: No, I tried that. “Why?” “Forty-two.”
Doesn’t work. Let’s get her ready, babe.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I mean, why do you want to know the Ultimate
Question?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Oh. Well – partly the curiosity, partly a
sense of adventure, but mostly I think it’s for the fame and the
money.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: But – you’re President of the Galaxy, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Yes, Arman.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary, I
find the Question, that’s permanent. It sticks. Plus everyone thinks
you’re deep. Win-win.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: But you don’t know the name of the computer
that other computer was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Which is why I’m going there.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: There. To find Deep Thought. On
Magrathea.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Magrathea!? Magrathea is a myth, a legend…</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: No, it isn’t. It’s real, cousin. And this is
the only ship in the universe that can get you there.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You mean to tell me you carved up your brain
so you could become President so you would get invited to the launching
ceremony of this ship…so you could steal it… so you could go to
Magrathea – which, according to most sane people, doesn’t even
exist?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Why this ship? What’s so special about
it?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I don’t seem to be letting myself in on any
of my secrets.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Because of this, obviously.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Infinite Improbability Drive? So they finally
built one that works. And that’s how we got picked up.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Exactly. And I’m guessing if we hit that
button – we go to Magrathea.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You’re guessing?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey, anyone who’s not up for that, there’s
the door. Now who’s in?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: For a trip to a place that doesn’t exist? I’m
in. My editor will think I’m crazy, but what the hell – he already
thinks I’m dead.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Definitely. I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Do I even have a choice?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What exactly does an Infinite Improbability
Drive do?</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: The Infinite Improbability Drive is a
new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that
tedious mucking about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive reaches
Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in
every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the
appropriate re-entry point. The principle of generating small amounts of
finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57
Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong
Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well
understood.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Such generators were often used to
break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess’s
undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance
with the Theory of Indeterminacy.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Well, Captain…?</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Many respectable physicists said they
weren’t going to stand for that sort of thing partly because it was a
debasement of science, but mostly because they didn’t get invited to
those sort of parties.</p>
<p><strong>vogon captain</strong>: We had them sir. These are the
coordinates. But – they’re not here.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: I can see that. WHERE ARE THEY?</p>
<p><strong>knitted zaphod</strong>: Is this going to happen every time
we hit that button?</p>
<p><strong>knitted trillian</strong>: Very probably, yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Did it work? Are we there?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Yes!…I think. Computer?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hi, fella!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Can you please change that zarking
annoying voice!!?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Computer? What planet is that, please?</p>
<p><strong>ow!!</strong>: Did you just pluck a hair from my head?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Yeah, as if, apeman.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks for waiting, everyone. I’m just
tickled pink to tell you we are currently in orbit around the planet
Viltvodle 6.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Humma Kavula!</p>
<p><strong>vogon captain</strong>: Sir, the Heart of Gold has just
requested permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should I pursue?</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: That is not a request to which I can
respond, captain. Should I pursue what? Are you requesting hyperspace
clearance so that you may pursue the fugitive?</p>
<p><strong>vogon captain</strong>: Yes, commander.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Then you must say that, captain – in request
form.</p>
<p><strong>vogon captain</strong>: Requesting hyperspace clearance to
pursue the fugitive, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Thank you. Request acknowledged. Await
response.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Bring me the request to pursue fugitive
forms.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: This is ridiculous! What do you need, an
executive order? Fine. I order you. Stop doing this! Go and get him!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: According to Subsection 94b, paragraph 2,
you’re not authorized to make such an order.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: But I’m acting president!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Then act like a president, and do
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Humma Kavula!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Why does he keep saying that?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I don’t know. I’m not used to seeing him
this way.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You mean fully clothed?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Sorry, but I can’t for the life of me figure
out why you, the most brilliant woman I have ever met, have ended up
with that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid politician! I mean, look at
him!</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Clearly unlike any guy I’ve ever met.
Look, if you’re going to pout your way around space, then maybe you
should just go home.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I can’t. That’s the whole point – and I’ve
been trying to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, look what I found in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I wouldn’t tell her if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: She deserves to know.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: But if you tell her and she ends up with you
because you’re literally the last guy on Earth – you’ll always doubt her
intentions.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Got your towel?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Do I need it?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Only always.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: In the beginning, the universe was
created. This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely
regarded as a bad move.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Many races believe that it was created
by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle 6 firmly
believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of
a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live
in perpetual fear</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: of the time they call “The Coming of
Great White Handkerchief” are small blue creatures with more than fifty
arms each. …who are therefore unique in being the only race in history
to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Humma Kavula!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I’ll handle this.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: The handkerchief is coming, beloveds.
Are you ready? Let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of
compassion on us.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: Almighty Arkleseizure, we lift our
noses, clogged and unblown in reverence to you.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hello, Humma.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: That’s Humma Kavula? I thought he was just
using a swear word.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Humma Kavula was his opponent in the election.
Something happened during the campaign. Zaphod never forgave him.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: Send the handkerchief, lord, so that
it may wipe us clean. We ask this in your precious holy name…</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Achoo.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: Bless you.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous
President. The Arkleseizure has exhaled many blessings upon you. What
brings you to our humble planet?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I think you know why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: I don’t think I do.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Oh, I think you think you don’t, but we both
know – you do.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: Elequent as always, Zaphod. Your
ability to communicate a clear thought never ceases to amaze.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: You called me stupid!</p>
<p><strong>humka kavula</strong>: Interesting. And I don’t know what
you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: During the campaign, Humma – you said
I was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: This Humma you speak of no longer
exists. He came here in his consolation position as Ambassador to Gamma
Z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his
wicked ways. He now goes by the holy name Tazelo the Unceasingly
Righteous, given to him by his devoted followers.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Why do I get the feeling he’s going to get
us all killed?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Probably because it’s very possible. Just
don’t save me, okay? We’re even.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: The election is ancient history,
Zaphod, but if memory serves – you won, proving that good looks and
charm win over brilliance and ability to govern.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: And incidently – you are stupid.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: That’s really not the point.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: You haven’t come halfway across the
galaxy to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you here, Zaphod?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I don’t know. I was headed for Magrathea, I
ended up here.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: How very, very… …improbable.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: I kept a few souvenirs from my former
life. Ah, the heady days of space piracy… so young, so foolish..,</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: I’ll gladly give you the coordinates
to Magrathea…</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: …provided you bring me something in
return.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: A gun.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: A gun?</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: A very special gun. Designed by the
greatest computer ever invented, now buried in the bowels of
Magrathea.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Fine. I’ll get your gun. Just give me the
coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: And what will you give me to insure
your return?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: My word as President.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: Ha! I’d be better off with the dung of
a Bethusian Mega Donkey.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Okay, then I’ll get you that.</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: I need a hostage, something you hold
dear. Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod head 2</strong>: Nooo!!!</p>
<p><strong>humma kavula</strong>: You should quit while you’re “a head”
Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the Magrathean defence system
alive.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Are we sure this is the right way?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yes! I think. I don’t know. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, thank you for clearing that up.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Mr. President!…Zaphod, over here!…I want to
have your baby!, etc…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Back to the ship. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>vogon police #1</strong>: Mr. President! We are here for your
protection!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Fire upon the kidnapper!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Zarquon! Friendly fire! Well, if that’s what
they want–</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey! Let’s do lunch! Nice haircut, fella!
Hey! Your kids are the same age as mine– We should get them together
some time!</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: Commander! The President is the
kidnapper!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Cease fire!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh God, I really hate Thursdays.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zaphod, what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Build bridges between the stars! He holds up
two peace signs, a la Nixon.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I think that was his campaign slogan.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Alright, follow me.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: There they are!</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Back off or I’ll kill him, I swear I
will!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Could that actually kill him?</p>
<p><strong>admirers</strong>: Mr. President, Mr. President!…</p>
<p><strong>female admirer</strong>: I totally voted for you!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Get her!</p>
<p><strong>vogon police</strong>: Resistance is useless!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Tricia!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Bring her to Vogsphere for processing,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: They’re coming here!? But they’ve only
accomplished half the mission. What about Zaphod? HE MUST FACE
JUSTICE!!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: My instructions were clear…</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: “Apprehend the kidnapper, rescue the
president.” We do them in that order. And until the kidnapper is
properly processed, she isn’t officially apprehended, now is she,
Mr. Vice- President?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: We have to go! Let’s GO!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Computer! Take us to Magrathea!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What? No! Follow those ships!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey – my third arm. I had one, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: We have to go after her!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Boys, please! Not so rough. You’re damaging
my joystick.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Ghastly, isn’t it? I was asked to change the
personality type, this was the emergency back-up.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How, if you want me to take you somewhere,
we’re going to have to start using our magic words, “please” and “thank
you.”</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Can you change it back?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I can – but I won’t enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m wait-ing…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ford?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Marvin?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Don’t look at me. I’m too depressed.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Computer?! Isn’t there some kind of manual
override switch thing?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeeessss…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Magic words?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Show me the override switch or I’ll
reprogram you with a very large axe.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I can see this relationship is something
we’re all going to have to work at.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I think I should push this button.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What’s that? What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: A sign lit up saying “Please do not push this
button again.”</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I know. Dreadful, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Sorry about the landing. Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Magrathea!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Wrong. This is the Vogon planet. This is
Vogsphere.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: No. It’s Magrathea! I know it!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Little something I learned about on an
Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them when they really need to
concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: A Thinking Cap.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: This will all end in tears, I just know
it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I checked the guide for ways to rescue a
prisoner from Vogsphere. It said “Don’t.” I’m assuming your plan is
better.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, I sort of had this idea we could…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Did anyone see that?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Nothing. Just my imagination.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch me.
Something’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Okay. I think we…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You, too?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yes. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I th…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What do you think, Zaphod?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I think we should keep going.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What the blazes is that?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I have… an idea.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Okay, don’t think of anything. Don’t have
ideas or theories – nothing.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I can’t, help it! Trillian is in there
somewhere and we need an idea to save her.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I have an idea. Run!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ever the politician.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Okay, so… …not thinking, not thinking, no
ideas coming… …this is by no means an idea that has any merit, but
Marvin – can you give me a hand?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Alright, where is she?</p>
<p><strong>vogon behind counter</strong>: Who? The Director of Robot Arm
repair? Next building, out the door to the left.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Actually, we’re looking for… …someone you’re
detaining, perhaps in some form of incarceration…</p>
<p><strong>vogon behind counter</strong>: Prisoner Release Department.
Six buildings down, out the door, right, left, then two rights. Big gray
building, can’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>vogon officer</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Trillian.</p>
<p><strong>vogon officer</strong>: Not registered.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Try Tricia McMillan.</p>
<p><strong>vogon officer</strong>: Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of
Blaard?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: No. Tricia Imogene McMillan of Earth.</p>
<p><strong>vogon officer</strong>: Sorry. No record of “Earth.”</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Earth. In the Milky Way? Um…galactic
Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.</p>
<p><strong>vogon officer</strong>: Right. Here it is. “Earth.
Destroyed.” Do you have a second home planet?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Destroyed? No – that’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>vogon officer</strong>: Says here it was destroyed to make
way for a hyperspace expressway. The order was given…three weeks
ago.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: He said the gray building, right?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: There. That’s it. This way.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Leave this to me. I’m British. I know how to
queue.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I don’t believe you. This is some sort of
trick. Zaphod wouldn’t blow up a planet, especially mine.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: These are the orders.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Love and kisses…?</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Now – according to Section 8, sub-section 34
dash A, the punishment for kidnapping is a recitation of the classic
poem, “Ode to the Removal of Your Left Kidney.” Unless – said kidnapping
is of the President, in which case you are to be fed to the Ravenous
Bugblatter Beast of Traal. We thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>female vogon processor</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes. Hi. We’re here about getting a prisoner
released?</p>
<p><strong>female vogon processor</strong>: Prisoner release form?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Right. Once I’ve filled it out can I return
to the front of the line, seeing as I’ve already waited…</p>
<p><strong>female vogon processor</strong>: No. Next!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Can’t you do something?! You’re President,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: You want me to make a speech, shake a hand?
That’s what I do – I think. It’s all a little fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>female vogon processor</strong>: This Prisoner is being
detained for… Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for release at this
time. You can make an appointment for a later date or take a number and
wait.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Alright, look. This is the President.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: He says the whole kidnapping thing was a
terrible misunderstanding, she didn’t mean anything by it and he’s
ordering you to let her go.</p>
<p><strong>female vogon processor</strong>: But this isn’t a
Presidential Release of Prisoner form. Those are blue.</p>
<p><strong>female vogon processor</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>vogon processor</strong>: Go to the Prisoner Release Lobby,
out the door, right, left, 2nd door on the right.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: You’re free to go. Release her.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: What!? He’s here?! Zaphod is here!? Let’s
go get him!</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: Commander?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: You bastard. You signed the order to
destroy Earth?!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: “Love and kisses, Zaphod?” I saw the form.
You didn’t even read it, did you?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Honey, I’m President of the Galaxy. I don’t
get a lot of time for reading.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: An entire planet, Zaphod. My home. Gone.
All because you thought someone wanted your autograph!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: They framed me! It’s routine for controlling
Presidents!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Cancellation of the Rescue of the
President.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Now. Get me the Apprehension of the
President form.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Trillian…</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: You knew. Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I tried. He threatened me.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Get a backbone, Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What about coming here to rescue you?! That
was my brilliant idea!</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: The President tests my patience. This time,
I shall pursue him myself. Ready my ship!</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: Yes! This is more like it.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: My license is expired, Mr. Vice President. I
can’t fly with an expired license – it’s against the law.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hi, fellas. Hold on to your hats!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Eddie! Welcome back!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Guys, I’m just super happy to tell you we’re
approaching hyperspace exit Gamma</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Okay, that’s it…I think. Computer? Is
that…where are we headed again?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Magrathea?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hang on, fella, and I’ll check.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Look, you’re right. You deserved to know and
I should’ve told you. I don’t blame you if you’re angry.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Right. Anyway…I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you we
are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the
legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Take us in.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s rubbish.</p>
<p><strong>ghostly image</strong>: Greetings. This is a recorded
announcement as we’re all out the moment. The Commercial council of
Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit, but regrets that the
entire planet is temporarily closed for business. If you would like to
leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted, kindly do so at
the tone.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Closed? How can a planet be closed?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay,
computer. Keep going. Take us down.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Happy to!</p>
<p><strong>ghostly image</strong>: It is most gratifying that your
enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated. As a token of our
appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles
we’ve just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure on-going quality
of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Guys, I’m delighted to tell you there are two
thermonuclear missiles headed right for us. Should I take evasive
action?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Um…yes, computer. Evade!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There seems to be something jamming my
guidance systems. Impact minus 45 seconds. Call me Eddie if it’ll help
you relax.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Computer! DO SOMETHING!!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sure thing, fellah. Handing over manual
control. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I can’t do this without my other arm!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Did we lose them?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: No. They’re right behind us.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Look, why don’t I just hit this thing?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: NO! We’re here! No telling where it will
send us!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Um…where are we?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Exactly where we were, I think.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: And the missiles?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias
and a very surprised looking whale.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: At an improbability factor of eight million,
seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to
one against.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I could really use a cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: It is important to note that suddenly,
and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into
existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since
this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent
creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a
whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a
whale any more. This is what it thought as it fell.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Ahhhh!!!! What’s happening? Excuse me! Who am
I? Hello? Why am I here? What’s my purpose in life? What do I mean by
who am I? What is this ‘I’ that I want to know what it is? Calm down,
get a grip now … ooh! This is an interesting sensation…</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: From below. The whale is wriggling a bit.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh! This is an interesting sensation, what is
it? It’s a sort of… yawning, tingling sensation in … well I suppose I’d
better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in
what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the
world, so let’s call it my stomach! Good. Ooooh! It’s getting quite
strong now. And hey,what’s this whistling roaring sound going past what
I’m suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that … wind! Is
that a good name? It’ll do. Perhaps I can give it a better name later
when I’ve found out what it’s for! It must be very important because
there certainly seems to be an awful lot of it. Hey! What’s this thing …
this … let’s call it a tail - yeah! Tail!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty
good, can’t I? Wow! Wow! Doesn’t seem to achieve much but I’ll probably
find out what it’s for later on. How. Have I built up a coherent picture
of things yet? No. Never mind. Hey, this is really exciting, so much to
find out about, ao much to look forward to, I’m quite dizzy with
anticipation … Or is it the wind? There really is an awful lot of that
now, isn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: And hey! What’s this thing coming suddenly
coming towards me very fast, so big and flat and round it needs a big
wide-sounding name like … ow … ound…round … ground! That’s it, ground! I
wonder if it’ll be friends with me?</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Curiously, the only thing that went
through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was “Oh no, not
again.”</p>
<p><strong>guide voice</strong>: Many have speculated that if we knew
why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about
the nature of the Universe than we do now.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey…this looks familiar.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Must be portal doors.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You mean – the hippies were right?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Okay. In we go.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?! Are you out of what’s left of your
mind? We can’t step into that…that.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We gotta pick one, right? If it’s not the
right one, we come back and pick another. No biggie.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes – big biggie. What if that’s the last
door we ever step through? What if it rips us into tiny little atomic
particle…thingies.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: It’s the right one. I have a hunch.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ford..?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: He’s got good hunches. I say we go.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half
a brain who’s wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? Are you insane?!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey, I think I resent that.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I don’t care what you think you think…</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: That’s supposed to happen…I think.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hey, wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No. No! NOOO!!!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I told you this would all end in tears.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Life is full of paradoxes, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Don’t talk to me about life.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Here I am, God knows how far from home…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Don’t talk to me about God.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: …and this is where I see the most
spectacular sunset I’ve ever laid eyes on. We only had the one sun at
home. Planet called Earth.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I know. You keep going on about it. It
sounds awful.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh no, it’s beautiful. Or at least, it
was…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Did it have oceans?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes. Great wide rolling blue oceans.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Can’t bear oceans.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on
a dead planet – with a manically depressed robot.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You think you’ve got problems? What are you
supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don’t bother
to answer that, I’m fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and
even I don’t know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to
think down to your level.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: My name is not important.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: You must come with me. Terrible
events are afoot. You must come or you’ll be late.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Late? What for?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: What is your name, Earthman?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Dent. Arthur Dent.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Late as in “the late
Dentarthurdent.” It’s a sort of threat you see. Never been much good at
them myself, but I’m told they can be terribly effective.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Your friends are safe. You can trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Trust a man who won’t tell me his name?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: My name? Very well… My name
is…Slartibartfast.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: I said it wasn’t important.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I could calculate your chances of survival –
but you won’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: I must warn you. We are about to
pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It may disturb you. It
scares the willies out of me.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Whaa!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Funny how just when you think life can’t
possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.</p>
<p><strong>ghostly image</strong>: This is a recorded announcement as
we’re all out at the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks
you for…</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Turn that off.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: I told you you might find it a bit
disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I have found this whole day a bit
disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Did you know we built planets?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Fascinating trade. Doing the
coastlines was always my favorite. Used to have endless fun doing all
the little fiddly bits round fjords. But the Galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom- built planets are something of a luxury
commodity… At any rate, there’s been a terrible mix up with your planet.
You must come with me or it’s all going to blow up in our faces. The
best laid plans of mice, you know…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: …and men.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Mmmm? What?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The best laid plans of mice and men.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: I don’t think men have got much to
do with it.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Welcome to our factory floor.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: This is it!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Deep Thought…!</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Shhh. This is a good bit.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Oh great Deep Thought…we have traveled
long…and far. Have you calculated… the Ultimate Question? Of Life, the
Universe and Everything?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zaphqd</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: I’ve been watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: I designed another computer to perform
that great task.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Oh, right…I forgot. Is it here?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Not here. Another world.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: It’s on another world?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: It is another world. Or was.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Ask your companion.</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Not him.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: 0kay – you’re sure you don’t have the
Question? Or a way to you, you know – access it or something. I think
I’ve done like a lot to get here…</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: Shhhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>deep thought</strong>: The show’s back on.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Great. This is just great. Let’s go find
something else for my entire life to be about.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us for? We
have to get it. You gave the guy your head.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I know. Why did I do that?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Um…Deep Thought? We we’re told you have a
g…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Here. Take it. I don’t do guns.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Great! This is a bust, too!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, man, you must be really frustrated. To go
through all you did only to come here and get no answer, which means no
fame and money, and you deserve that, man. Because you’re great – you’re
just really, really great.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Give me that thing.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: The galaxy was a bit of a shambles,
you see. Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and
really creative and interesting things like that. No one doing the
boring jobs.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, you had that problem, too?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: In spades. So a species was
genetically engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax inspectors, traffic
wardens, government officials. We were commissioned to build a special
planet for them. Problem was, some cleverdick made it so any time one of
the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around
the face.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What? You did that? I’ve been there!</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Then I gather you’ve met some of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The Vogons?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Relentless blighters.</p>
<p><strong>99 marvin 99</strong>: Life. Loathe it or ignore it, you
can’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: …and you’re right, I shouldn’t be so upset
’cause life goes on and I should just go on with it, right?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Shoot him again.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Hitchhiking is good. Towels are good,
too.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah. I kinda like this.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: A gun that makes people suddenly see
things from your point of view. Useful tool for the deranged evangelist
trying to convert the masses, eh?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: We should get back. Arthur’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: I do – especially since we’re both
somewhat of an endangered species now.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Why so edgy?</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Of course you’re edgy, your planet’s been
blown up and you’ve been tooling around the Galaxy with the guy who
signed the order</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: You actually wanted to know the Question
because you always thought there was more to life, and now you’re
crushed because you find out there really isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: You’ve got no home, no family, no one to be
with – and you’re stuck with me, another in a long line of men who
doesn’t appreciate you because he’s too busy appreciating himself.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Give me that thing.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Won’t affect me. I’m already a woman.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Uh oh – oh. It’s okay, it’s only a couple
of…</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Here we are, then. Look
familiar?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So – it wasn’t destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Actually, it was. This is a back-up.
Earth Mark II.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So you’re saying you … made the Earth?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Well, not me alone. It was a group
effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard of a place, I think it’s
called Norway?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: That was one of mine. Won an award
you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry to hear about it being blown
up. Shocking cock up. The mice were furious.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Mice? Who cares about bloody mice?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Are you a fan of plate
tectonics?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Voila! Himalayas. Good, eh?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Earthman, you must realize that the
planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was
destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was
built. Ten minutes later, we would have been free and clear. But we gave
them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to
retrieve this back-up copy. And they’ve brought you with them.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: They brought…I’m sorry, when you say “mice”
do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese
fixation?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: These creatures you call “mice” are
merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent
pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese must’ve been
a front. They were experimenting on you, you see. A vast computer
program…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ah. I see where you’re confused. You see –
we were experimenting on them.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Oh, I gather they arranged for you
to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your
thinking here and there. But you were actually elements in the computer
program. They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional
beings. Ah. They’ve nearly finished the oceans.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So – you’re trying to tell me that mice
designed and built Deep Thought…and Deep Thought designed the
Earth…which was a giant supercomputer…that you built…to calculate the
Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the
program was completed?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: That’s bureaucracy for you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Actually, this explains a lot. All my life
I’ve had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world,
something big, something sinister …</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: That’s just perfectly normal
paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: I don’t know, perhaps I’m old and
tired, but I always think that the chances of finding out what’s really
going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy. I’d much rather be happy than
right any day.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And are you?</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: No. That’s where it all falls down
of course. Here we are, then.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Is this…?</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Arthur!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What – what are you doing? What happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Funniest thing. Our hosts attacked us with
Dismodulating Anti Phase Stun Mist then brought us to this amazing meal
as a way to make it up to us . Try the mutton. It’s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Zarking incredible.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Hosts attack you –? And then you sit down
for – is that tea?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Now that’s a cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: We’re glad you like it, Earth
creature.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: After ten million years on Earth, and a
rather large chunk of that time in England, it would be utterly
humiliating if we didn’t know how to make a decent pot of tea.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse
and Franky mouse . They control a large sector of the Universe in our
dimension . I’m sorry, I thought you were told about the mice…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn’t quite
prepared for the full reality of it.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Sit, Earthman. Eat.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: In a moment, perhaps. I can’t seem to let go
of this table.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Pardon the interruption, but I’ll
just be getting back to work now.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: That won’t be necessary,
Slartibartfast.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Smarty fart blast?</p>
<p><strong>benjy/franky</strong>: Eat!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: It looks like we won’t be needing the
new Earth after all, now that we’ve found the only living native of the
planet.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: But…they’ve nearly finished the
oceans.</p>
<p><strong>frahky mouse</strong>: That will be all, Slartibartfast.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m sorry, when you say “the only living
native” – do you mean me? What about her?</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: We performed some rudimentary DNA tests
on the ship. She’s half-native. Her real father was a Blahardid, the
hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet
Olbed, who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one
Ms. Francis McMillan.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Which explains a lot.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So – mostly harmless and me. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: We’re sorry to have stage managed you
so shamelessly, but once we learned you were the only full-blooded
Earthling in the universe, it was important that we get you here by any
means necessary.</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: We’ve spent a considerable amount of
time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question, and
the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic
Vogons sickens me to no end. Which is why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Sit, Earthling. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: This chair is much more –
comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Drink.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Mmmm. This really is delicious.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Good. Glad you like it. Now – to
business.</p>
<p><strong>ford/zaphod</strong>: To business!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Sorry. Thought you were proposing a
toast.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: About this Ultimate Question. You see,
we’ve been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat
show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we’re very much inclined to
take it.</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: But - and here’s the point - we have
to have product. Which means we still need an ultimate question.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Or at least, one that sounds
ultimate.</p>
<p><strong>franky house</strong>: Yes. Got to sound good.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: An Ultimate Question that sounds good… From
a couple of mice…for a chat show.</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: And as it turns out, the chances are
astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in
your brain. Which is why we need it. More tea?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m sorry – did you just say you need my
brain?</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Yes. To extract the question.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You can’t have my brain. I’m using it.</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: Barely.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: We can replace it if you think it’s
important. An electronic brain maybe.</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: A simple one should suffice. Who would
know the difference?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I would!</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: No, you wouldn’t. We could program you
not to.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ford! Zaphod! TRILLIAN!!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What are they– what’s in the food?!</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Don’t worry. You won’t feel a
thing.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You want the question that goes with the
answer “42” How about “What’s six times seven?” Or “How many Vogons does
it take to screw in a lightbulb?” Or here’s one, “How many roads must a
man walk down?”</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Hey, that’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Fine. Take it. There’s plenty more where
that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can
assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota
of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness…?</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: We don’t want to be happy. We want to
be rich.</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: Take his brain.</p>
<p><strong>benjy mouse</strong>: Shoot him!!</p>
<p><strong>franky mouse</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Ohhhh, I think I’m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I must warn you, I’m feeling very
depressed.</p>
<p><strong>kwaltz</strong>: Mr. President! We are here for your
protection!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Okay – that thing I said about not saving my
life because we’re even? Scratch that. Save at will.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: We need that gun.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: We need tighter gun control!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We need his other head. Okay – I’ll create a
distraction.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Brilliant plan. I’m certain it will
work.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You know – I think sometimes you say things
that mean something other than what you’re actually saying.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>arthur trillian</strong>: I thought I was…what are I thought
I was…I’ll get you… get back… okay it… you already… fine, fine… fine</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: It’s a towel! It’s only a TOWEL!! GET</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Duck!</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>vogon police force</strong>: Oh what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: What am I so pissed off about? I’m great?
I’m zarking incredible! Everyone loves me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at
me…etc.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: Marvin. You saved our lives.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I know. Wretched, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>questular</strong>: Oh man! I love being me!!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: I’ve just been informed by some of
the lads that since we’re so near completion, we’re going to go ahead
and finish Earth. We can put it back exactly the way it was when you
left, you know – unless there’s anything you’d like to change. Something
you think your planet could do without?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes. Me.</p>
<p><strong>trillian</strong>: Let’s go somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, You name it. I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>zaphod</strong>: I’m going to Humma’s. He has my head…I
think. Doesn’t he? I’m so confused.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And I’m hungry. After we get your head let’s
grab a bite. I know this great restaurant at the end of the
universe.</p>
<p><strong>slartibartfast</strong>: Okay. Hold tight.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stand-by for commencement of life cycle. All
systems checked and cleared. Commencing.</p>
