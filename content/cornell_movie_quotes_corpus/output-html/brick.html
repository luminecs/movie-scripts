<h1 id="brick">brick</h1>
<p><strong>a wrist watch</strong>: 12:43. Brendan looks up from the
watch.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Brendan?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Emily?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Yeah. How’s things?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Status quo.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What’s going on, Em?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: It’s good to see you, Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Two months.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Yeah. I didn’t even know your locker. I had
to ask Brain.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Em, why don’t we meet somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I screwed up real bad. I really screwed
up.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Screwed up how?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I did what she said with the brick, I didn’t
know it was bad, but the pin’s on it now for poor Frisco and they’re
playing it all on me-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Slow down now, what?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You gotta help me Brendan I think tug-
Oh!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Brain.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Hey Brendan. It’s been awhile. Where you
been eating?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Back of school.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Huh. Yeah, no one’s seen you. What’s it
been, a couple months?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah, it’s been awhile. You gave Emily my
locker number?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: A few days ago. Was I wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: To give it?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: It’s been so long, I don’t know you two’s
stats.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: It has been awhile. Who’s she been eating
with?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: I dunno. It’s hard to keep track.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Can be.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: She hasn’t been doing too good.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah well. I’m not looking for a patch up.
Em’s life is her own. But she asked for my help.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Help with what?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t even care, it’s not
my business. I just want to know she’s ok, so I’ve got to find her.
That’s all this is.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Well. I know she was poking in with the
Ivy-bound cheerleading elite. Laura Dannon’s crowd.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah. Brad Bramish with her. Cream on the
upper crust.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: He’s a sap.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Know him?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: By sight.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: I won’t argue then. Anyway Em tagged
after them for a bit, but it didn’t work. So she picked her way down the
food chain. Last I seen she was with whasshername, that drama vamp.
Small time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one you dated-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Kara.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: That’s my bus.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You know her locker number?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Kara’s?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Em’s.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: 239.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Thanks Brain. Keep your specs on, find me
if she shows.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - day</strong>: Sixth period has broke.
Masses of students pile into busses.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hello, Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Kara.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Come to see the show?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No, I didn’t. Lapdog, blow.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Stay. Don’t be mean.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’m all friendly. Watch your head, kid -
that thing bites.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: About Emily Kostich.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Get me my purse. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Still picking your teeth with freshmen?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: You were a freshman once.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Way once, sister. You and Em were tight for
a bit. Who’s she eating with now?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Eating with?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Eating with. Lunch. Who.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: You’re a cutie.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You gonna tell me?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Guess you’re up from the underneath then. The
whole Jerr thing blown over. Lucky strikes, you and your partner get
bulled, you come up clean. But I guess you were always the brains of the
outfit.1</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where’s Emily?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: God.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I don’t know where she’s at, Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I know you do, so why don’t you want me to
find her?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Maybe I’m looking out for you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Well I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Brendan… you looking to get back into things?
I could use you.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Hello, ma’am, this is Tom, I’m a friend
from school. Could I speak to…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Oh, hi Tom. Laura’s here, hold
on.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’m calling for details.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Details about the party.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t think we’ve met.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: Well then I don’t think you’re
invited to my party. It’s a rather exclusive gathering.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I can imagine. You should really work on
your invite management. That might be a personal ‘room for improvement’
area in your life. But discretion of your invite sending aside, I have
procured a certain someone’s invitation, and would like details.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: You think you’re cute, whoever you
are.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Wait’ll you get a load of my felt fedora
and spats.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: Who are you? Or I’ll hang up.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You don’t know me - I’ll save you some
time.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: I know everyone and I’ve got all the
time in the world.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation I’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: What you said.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Emily Kostich.</p>
<p><strong>laura’s voice</strong>: 15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove.
Buzz 42 at the gate. Nine o’clock. But who-</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: If the coach wants to play me I’ll play, but I
can’t put my best game in if I’ve got to worry about whether I’m going
to be in there. Halftime last game, coach is pissed I ran it on a pass
play, out on the field he says to me ‘you gotta think about the team and
you gotta’ you know and ‘if you run that ball again you’re out’, and I
said to him you gotta let me play! I’m out there, let me play, and he’s
saying ‘no you’re out’ and I kept saying ‘Let me play! Let me play! Let
me play!’, just right in his face-</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: He was!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Just ‘Let me play! Let me play! Let me play!’
‘No you gotta’ ‘No, let me play! Let me play! Let me play!’</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tom!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: He doesn’t give me a play to make, what can I
do, you know?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Leaving.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh. Unless your anecdote’s got a 2nd
act.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Why don’t you leave?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s what I was doing.</p>
<p>****: Whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Jameson.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I like a man who knows what he’s
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s a pretty sick thing to be attracted
to.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Brad’s not a good guy to get on the wrong
side of.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix me
one.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’ll never get through all this.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I knew your old partner Jerr since grade
school. Tough break. How long were you two joined up before your
operation got the sting?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: A few months. Could have helped himself out
by turning me in, but he took the heat. He was a good guy. Solid.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Was he?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You knew him.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yeah I did. So why are you here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’m looking for Emily.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: She wasn’t invited.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She had an invitation.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well like you said, I’ve got to work on that.
Em’s been AWOL for a good month, nobody’s seen her.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I saw her yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Nearly nobody’s seen her. So what did she
tell you?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Score 0 for finesse.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Listen, you’re scratching at the wrong door.
I wasn’t with Emily enough to know details of what she was in, I just
got wind of the downfall, and I didn’t get any details of that, except
that it was bad. So now that we’re showing some cards…</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: If you haven’t got a finger in Em’s
troubles, why’d her name get me into your rather exclusive party?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Keep up with me now. I don’t know, but it
sounded like you did, and a body’s got a right to be curious. Now I’m
not so sure.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Well I’ll put that body to bed. I don’t
know a damn thing about whatever troubles, and that works for me. I just
want to find her.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Coffee and pie.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Coffee and pie oh my?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And you didn’t hear it from me.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’ll stay right here and wait – I’ll be
five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where’s Dode?</p>
<p><strong>stoner 1</strong>: Dunno, bra.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Dode?</p>
<p><strong>stoner 2</strong>: Uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Hey Brendan. Maybe you shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Kara told me you know where Em’s at.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Uh huh. And why are you looking for Em?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She asked for my help.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Uh huh. Listen man, I’ve got plenty on my
plate without dealing with some jilted ex.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: It’s not about that.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Whatever it’s about, act smarter than you look
and drop it.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: She’s with me, and right now that’s the best
place for her. Leave the low life to the low lifers and dangle.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You’re on the bright side of dim, Dode, but
if I thought you had this half- handled I’d be eating lunch. Where’s she
at?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Better get while it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>big stoner</strong>: Back off.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Throw one at me if you want, hash head.
I’ve got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on
the lot of you.</p>
<p><strong>big stoner</strong>: Just easy-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where’s Em?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: She’s with me. She was tight when she called
you, man. Came to and freaked. She told me to shake you if you came by.
Said you’d only make things worse.</p>
<p><strong>stoner 1</strong>: Put him down, man!</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Deal with whatever this ain’t about and drop
it.</p>
<p><strong>big stoner</strong>: Nothing more here, bra.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her if
she still wants my help or not that’s her business, but I want to hear
it straight from her.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: She don’t -</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Today. She knows where I eat lunch.</p>
<p><strong>big stoner</strong>: And stay out, punk!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I must have sounded pretty crazy on the
phone. Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Who fed you that line, Em?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: And stop picking on Dode. He’s a good
guy.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: The Carrows rat?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: He’s a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: So what am I?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Yeah, what are you? Eating back here, not
liking anybody, how are you judging anyone? I loved you alot but I
couldn’t stand it, I had to get with people. I couldn’t heckle life with
you, I had to see what was what.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You’ve got to come back to me, Em.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: No. No. Never. I’m sorry. Never. I can’t love
on your terms, Brendan. I can’t do that, I’m not like you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You’re in a spot, I can get you out of it.
Come back to me, and whatever heat follows you I’ll deal with.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: No. You’re not hearing me, no. I don’t want
to be put away and protected. No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tell me about the trouble, the brick and
the pin -</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You gonna fix things like you did with Jerr?
No. I came to say goodbye, for good. Whatever you have to do to let me
go, do it. I’m gonna let you go, I’ve</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Hm. Do you know anything else about
this?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Slim pickings. Why’d you let Dode fly
when he came back to whose-her-name, at the theater?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Kara. It’s their turf, I couldn’t hear them
without being seen, and that would only biff their play. Best to know
it’s there, let it ride and see what comes of it. But anyway.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Hm. Well, if this is what I think it is,
it didn’t come straight from Dode, less he’s playing out of his league.
I can only give you my best guess.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: When the upper crust does shady deeds
they do them in different spots around town. I know under the pier’s
one, down by the bike trails in the state park’s another. There’s alot
of them. The pitch is they’ve got little symbols for each one, and
that’s how they tell each other the place, so word won’t get around. So
this might be that.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: But Dode wouldn’t know it?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: This is upper crust. Dode’s pie pan
grease.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Call anything up?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: How many places start with ‘A’? Or if
it’s a shape, or just a random symbol. Anyway, even if you figured it
out, what good could you do? She’s smart, she knows the play, she’s
gunning to square things.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: You said her business was none of yours,
so she’s alright, forget it now. Go home, sleep.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Your little Em.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Saint Clement police.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Hey, Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Find Emily?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah. What, are you here for zero?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Nah, I gotta take the early bus, cause
the others don’t run by my street.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Bad break.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Eh. Time to read’s nice. So what’s the
word with Em?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Can’t raise her?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: So what now?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Now. I don’t know. I guess it’s… I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: You think you can help her?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: You think you can get the straight, maybe
break some deserving teeth?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah. I think I could.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Kara tried to rope me. She came right out
and asked. She was scared. Tell me to walk from this, Brain. Tell me to
drop it.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Walk from it. Drop it. You’re thick as
what-all, Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: What first, tip the bulls?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No, bulls would gum it. They’d flash their
dusty standards at the wide-eyes and probably find some yegg to pin,
probably even the right one. But they’d trample the real tracks and
scare the real players back into their holes, and if we’re doing this I
want the whole story. No cops, not for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: So what first?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t know. Your mom still have the
cell?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: In her car.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Borrow it for a few days, get me the
number. Wait for my word, and cover for me first period. I’m going to be
a little late.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some
decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him, but I’m
nobody’s bull runner. This wasn’t a business sit. But yeah. I bulled
him. Got in tight, partnered up and sent him over.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You can’t keep me safe, Brendan. I’m in a
bigger world now, and you can’t hide me from it, and you can’t beat it.
Not if I don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: There’s the cell number.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Keep it on vibrate.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Better stop meeting me in the open too. I’m
going to start getting visible, and I need you on the underneath. I’ll
call.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Trueman asked for you. Wants words in his
office.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I bet. Keep him off me - stonewall him, he
won’t bite, just keep him away from me.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: I’ll try. So what’s first?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Make Em’s troubles mine. I’m going to throw
a few words at you, tell me if they catch. Brick.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Or bad brick.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tug.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Tug… that might be a drink.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Drink?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Vodka and milk or something, or maybe
not.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Poor Frisco.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Frisco. Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore last
year, I think. Real trash, maybe hit a class a week. Didn’t know him
then, and haven’t seen him around.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Pin.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Pin… the Pin?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: The Pin, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: The Pin’s kind of a local spook story.
You know the Kingpin?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ve heard it.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Same thing. Supposed to be old, like 26,
lives in town.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Jake1 runner, right?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Big time… maybe. Ask any dope rat where
their junk sprang they’ll say they scraped it from that who scored it
from this who bought it off so, and after four or five connections the
list’ll always end with the Pin. But I’ll becha you got every rat in
town together and said ‘show your hands’ if any of them’ve actually seen
the Pin, you’d get a crowd of full pockets.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You think the Pin’s just a tale to take
whatever heat?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: But what’s first?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: A show of hands.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Hey Brendan. Here for the show?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Would you go then, honey, cause I’ve got this
headache.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Try smoking like a chimney, I’ve heard that
helps.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: You don’t know Dode’s brand.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Oh I do now.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: The story about what?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: The story about what?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t want to play games if you’ve got a
headache. Get me if you want to spill it, but I can’t guarantee safe
passage after tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I don’t know what-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling card,
and I need words.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Brad Bramish?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tail Kara through lunch. She’s got
rehearsal but she’ll blow early. She goes home, drop her, else wait for
my call.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - lunch</strong>: Brendan wanders through
the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars
set aside at the far end of the lot.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: That’s all I’m saying, is put me in the game
and I’ll do what needs to be done, but they don’t put me in, what needs
doing don’t get done and don’t come crying to me, man. Get off my grill
man, you didn’t put me in, don’t come to me if you didn’t let me
play.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: They didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Listening.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright, you got me. I’m a scout for the
Gophers.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Of all things, yeah. Been watching your
game for a month, but that story just now clenched it. You’ve got heart,
kid. How soon can you move to Minneapolis?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Cold winters, but they’ve got a great
public transit system.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: There’s a thesaurus in the library. ‘Yeah’s
under ’Y’. Go ahead, I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Who invited you?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of
invited myself.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I think you’d better leave then.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No, I’m having too good a time.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Just the same.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: With you?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You know what’s good for you you’ll just beat
it. Beating a small frye won’t win me anything and it’s not going to do
you any good-</p>
<p><strong>straggler</strong>: Hey, is there a fight?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’re quite a pill.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why did you take a powder the other
night?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Same reason I’m taking one now.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hold it. I don’t get you. That’s a chilly
heel to be giving a girl who’s where you want to know about.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ll get where I’m going just fine.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I wouldn’t have to lead you in by the
hand-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I can’t trust you. Brad was a sap, you
weren’t, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you’re a
player. With you behind me I’d have to tie one eye up watching both your
hands, and I can’t spare it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’re not Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: You didn’t call.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Sorry. Kara went home though, didn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and
made two calls that she didn’t want on her phone bill.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Get the numbers?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: S’alright. Are me and Brad front page
news?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: All the buzz. You really do that?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Why? Is Brad the Pin?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Brad’s a sap. I downed him on his field and
his crew didn’t bite. So now I know he’s a sap and anyone who acts like
he isn’t is profiting by it. That’s not why I roughed him, though.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: For kicks?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Economics. Brad’s the school’s biggest jake
buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his
attention. Anyway, now’s just shaking things out. Look, you know a kid
around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: I told you before I don’t know the car.
Those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody I know that you don’t. And
Trueman again-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I
need to find that kid.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>int. office</strong>: Brendan sits with an ice pack against
his head in a tiny office. A man in his early thirties behind a wood
colored</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: You didn’t know this boy?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No sir, never seen him.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: And he just hit you?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Like I said, he asked for my lunch money
first. Good thing I brown bagged it.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: Alright Brendan. I’ve been looking to talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten, not
to see you fed.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: Fine, and well put.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: Tough teacher?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tough but fair.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: Mm. Anyway then, we know you’re clean, and
you’ve, despite your motives, you’ve been an asset to us. I think you’re
a good kid.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: I want to run a couple names by you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I was done here three months ago. I told
you then I’d give you Jerr and that was that, I’m not your inside line
and I’m not your boy.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: That’s not a very helpful-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You know what I’m in if the wrong yeg saw
me pulled in here?</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: What are you in?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No. And no more of these informal chats -
if you’ve got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and
I’ll see you at the parent conference.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: Hold it, I could - hold it - could write
you up for talking back to a VP. For looking at me in a threatening way.
I’d exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye. You can’t pull a play like
that unless I need you for something. So do I?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: So maybe you’re gonna need me too.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back
completely for a few weeks. There might be some heat soon.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: If it’s something I can’t cover, I won’t go
to bat for you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: If I get caught like that it’s curtains
anyway - I couldn’t have brass cutting me favors in public. I’m just
saying now so you don’t come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble
starts.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: Okay, here’s what I can do. I won’t pin you
for anything you aren’t caught at. I’ll ride it a little while, as long
as it doesn’t get too rough. But if anything comes up with your
fingerprints on it, I can’t help you. Also, if I get to the end of
whatever this is and it gets hot and you don’t deliver, The Veep will
need someone to hand over, police- wise. And I’ll have you. There better
be some meat at the end of this like you say, or at least a fall guy, or
you’re it.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: Get the hell off my campus, punk!</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No, Dode’s MIA all around.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’m 9 of 10 that Kara’s got him, but who
knows where. I shook but she’s not spilling.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No more job offers? So she’s got a
play.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: And I know enough about Kara to let that
worry me. Alright, keep your specs on for him. Any other news?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She did, huh?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Fourth period, nearly shook me upside
down. Can’t say I didn’t enjoy it, but why’d she come to me?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She’s tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know
me.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah, well. She’s some piece of work. If
I had known where you were I might have told her.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s the spirit. Ask around for Dode,
tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives in my eyes, I’m going home sick.
I’ll call you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I want to see the Pin.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, I guess you do.</p>
<p><strong>int. trunk of moving mustang</strong>: Brendan holds the
trunk about three inches open, just enough to see which street signs
pass by. Loud music plays from the car – “Sweet Baby James” by James
Taylor.1</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You the Pin?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Yeah. So now I’m very very curious what you’re
going to say next.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Maybe I’ll just sit and bleed at you.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Helled if you’re gonna go breaking my best
clients’ noses and expect me to play sandbag. Anyway you’ve been
sniffing me out before then, sniffing for me like a vampire bat for a
horse</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first; she
oughta hear this.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: No dice, soldier. Would have been a neat trick,
though.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I was going to make up some bit of
information or set up some phony deal, anything so you’d let me walk.
Then I was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street
address of the biggest dope port in the burgh.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: He knows zippo.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: 1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at the
desk in the den in the basement of the house with the tacky mailbox.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: You gonna do what now?!</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: No good, soldier.</p>
<p>****: Tug, stop.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where are my glasses? Hell with ya then.
Which wall’s the door in?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Sorry about this kid, but what the hell with
what you said before.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I thought we had orange juice, Brendan, I’m
sorry. How about Tang, or that’s more like soda isn’t it, or not soda
but it hasn’t got any juice in it, it can’t be very fortifying.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Water’s fine, ma’am, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Now just a moment, we have apple juice here,
if you’d like that, or milk, though you’ve got that in your cornflakes,
I don’t know if drinking it as well might be too much.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Apple juice sounds terrific.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s country style.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ll even give it to you in a country glass,
how’d that be? Boys?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: I’m fine, Mrs. M.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Thanks, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Okay, well I’m going to go, um, do something
in the other room now…</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: So hows bout we take another snap at hearing
your tale?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t know. It starts out same as before,
and this floor ain’t carpeted.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: We’re cooled off.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty cool
putting his fist in my head. I want him out.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Looky, soldier-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: The ape blows or I clam.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: So clam! What’ve you got I can’t beat out of
you back in the basement?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Give us a few minutes, Tug.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: About a year ago I had a small time dealing
partnership with Jerr Madison. Know him?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Till he took the fall for you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah well. I didn’t ask him to, but he was
a straight player. I got out clean - almost. Nothing on my official
record, but the VPs play it like I owe them one. When I made it clear I
wasn’t playing their hound dog, well they didn’t like it. They keep
calling me in, badgering me.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Gee that’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t like being told whose side I’m on.
So now they think I’m on your trail, I’m in a nice spot to know their
movements and feed them yours.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: I gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You haven’t got me yet.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: What, price?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Considering the benefits my services could
yield, I don’t think that’s unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: And what are your services exactly, just so I
can be specific on the invoice?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Whatever serves your interests.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Fair enough. I’ll have my boys check your tale,
and seeing how it stretches we’ll either rub or hire you. You’ll know
which by end of the day tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’ll drive you back.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Just drop me at school. How long was I
out?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Half an hour. It took all of it for me to
cool the Pin down.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You trust me now?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Less than when I didn’t trust you before.
If you can tell me your angle in this, maybe I can.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Come here.1</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: A few months go by, and the next I hear the
Pin’s raging over a situation with some certain junk Em was partial to,
and the downfall’s coming on Em’s head.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You think Em scraped the junk off the
Pin?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t know, but whether she scraped or
copped or just ran her tab around the world and into her own back, it
must have been grand. I’ve never seen the Pin so hot.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: This all helps but it’s not what I asked.
What’s your angle in all this?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t know. I’m usually pretty sharp, but…
maybe I see what you’re doing for Emily, trying to help her. And I don’t
know anyone who would do that for me.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Now you are dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Brendan Brendan Brendan!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where’s Dode flopped? I know you two are
cozed up, so you’ll tell me or you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Oooh, getting feisty. Last time we talked you
were giving ultimate-tims.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: It worked. You went to Laura, didn’t you?
Told her my tale.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: All part of your plan?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Turned out to be.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I feel so cheap and used.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Gol, I must seem a real cad. Sometimes I
just hate myself.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Whatever happened to us, Brendan?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where’s Dode flopped?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: We were a pair and a half for a few months,
weren’t we? Sometimes I miss having someone I can talk to. You ever miss
having someone? I guess you must.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I need to hear Dode’s tale about Emily.
It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: You better be sure you wanna know whatcha
wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh. Laura’s working with me now, and
I’ll have the Pin and Tug in my corner soon. The sooner I get the truth
from Dode or the truth about Dode from you, the safer you’ll both be.
No? Pass it on to Dode anyway. Maybe he’ll have the</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: You didn’t, did you?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: So what happens now?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Now we wait for the Pin’s answer. Unless
his crew spotted VP Truman’s social call this morning, it’ll be yes. I’d
give us 70/30. If we’re in I get under his skin and see what’s what. You
stick to Kara, keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay away from
Laura.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: I think she’s with us, Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ll let you know when she is.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alexander”.</strong>: He fishes the old note out and compares
them - different handwriting.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You the Pin’s?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a
sheepdog.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah I know him, I just can’t pin him to
any crowd. He’s definitely not muscle for anyone. He taps the Carrows
crowd but doesn’t hang with them. If you’ve got a guess I could check it
out-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: The Pin. If he’s with the Pin everything’s
kablooie and I gotta blow the burgh.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: I’ll check it. I’m in third now-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Never mind. If I don’t call by three call
in the bulls.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: So. Tangles.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: We’re doing a thing down at the Hole tonight.
Know it?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: South of T Street, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: It’s sort of a welcome you in thing. Eight
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I know what you did. I saw what you did.1</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some way.
And I’m going to tell someone.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Are you making an offer?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Maybe. Or maybe I’ll just do you in.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Hire another hash head to blade me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t need no blades, shamus. I just gotta
squawk.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Just to see you sweat.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Brendan?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah, I’m fine. Keep digging on the Burns
lug, but the main thing is to find Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked
into, it’s getting more and more urgent we talk.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Alright. Trueman was looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Trueman and the VP?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No, just Trueman.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Asked for me?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No, but looked.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s not good. Alright, keep me
posted.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: So I’m going to start you on the dope circles,
cleaning up the Turkish dues, pulling in the strags.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Small fries.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Yeah, well. Just to see how you handle. Anyway
there isn’t much else doing. I’m tailing out this big deal, but that’s
almost done.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Oh yeah? What was it?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there was a
snag in it, but it’s almost done now.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Almost, you said.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: It’s over enough. You’re gonna make me curious,
being so curious.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: He’s got my best interests, I know, he’s loyal,
he just gets hot.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Muscle you can’t control’s no good at
that.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: You’re working for me, not Tug, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Things can get, you know, it’s tough sometimes.
Twisted, complicated, watching all the, I don’t know. Everyone’s got
their thing. You read Tolkien?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Tolkien, the Hobbit books?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: His descriptions of things are really good.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: He makes you want to be there.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Don’t go to class.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Fifth period Trueman and the VP come in
asking for you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Agh.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Did they call your mom?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Probably. I got home late.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Get out of there too, then. Meet me
behind the library. I’ve got some stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ext. back of library - early morning</strong>: A cold gray
morning. The Brain hands Brendan a photocopy of a newspaper clipping,
“LOCAL YOUTH HOSPITALIZED”</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk
outside Pinkerton’s Deli three weeks ago. He was in a coma, his stomach
contained a sausage sandwich, a horse dose of Heroin and traces of
Choleric Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in laundry detergent.
Frisco’s still under</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No, the chem the junk must have been cut
with put him down.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Huh. Bad junk. Bad brick… could that form
of Heroin be called ‘Brick’?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No – it was a concentrated powder, its
street handle’s ‘whip’ or ‘rock’ or ‘brock’. Here. From Laura.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I told you to stay clear of Laura.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: You tell her to stay clear of me?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I gotta get voicemail.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: This isn’t good.</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: This is Trueman.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What the hell are you doing asking for me
in class?</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: What the hell are you doing out of
class?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>trueman</strong>: The VP and I needed to ask you a few
questions about Emily Kostich, who you might have heard is missing. It’s
a very serious thing. The police are involved. The VP and I knew you two
were close, so the VP and I came to ask you questions, but you were
truant. If you don’t have a valid excuse-</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ve been cut loose. I’m not safe here. We
shouldn’t have met in the open. Alright, lay low, but ask on the
underneath for Dode. That’s all that matters now, find Dode, but do it
on the underneath, got it?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’d like to have played it safe, but
there’s no time. The Pin’s not letting</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t know. Just find Dode.</p>
<p><strong>int. basement hallway - same</strong>: Deathly still and
silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to the lit doorway at the end of
the hall.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: What with the poking, genius?! Maybe you’re
poking for your bull friends!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Don’t be a sap. I can’t even face up at
school, the VP’s so hot for me.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah well. Maybe you’re looking to make
good.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’m looking to find this big game the Pin’s
played, not to gum it, but just so when its tail jams in my back I’ll
know who to bill for the embalming.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: You oughta ask him what you wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I did. He didn’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, well. That’s understandable.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: There was ten of them. I don’t know where he
picked them, he didn’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: So we get ten kils of brock, there aint
enough marks in the whole burgh to eat that. So he unloads eight of em
up way north, even up to the docks. I don’t know who.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Didn’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah. That was eight. So that’s the tenth in
there. We gotta break it into doses, sell em off round the high, maybe
some by Shorecliffs.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What about the ninth brick?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Ah yeah. There were problems with that.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: It, uh…</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Frisco.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, poor Frisco. You heard about that.
We’ll track down the rat. Just takes time.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I heard something fell with Emily
Kostich.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Emily who?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Kostich.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Don’t know her.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Has the Pin talked about her?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Not to me.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, he might know something. Ask him. Tell
me what he says, cause if you heard something, you know, I wanna
check.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Pow wowing?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Just shooting the shat.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, just shooting it.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Emily?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Emily Kostich. Where she’s at now. Says we’d
want to know. Wants to meet.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: So we’ll meet him. Four o’clock. Emily was
Tug’s girl for awhile. You know Emily, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: A while back.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: You’ve heard she’s missing?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah, I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: So maybe you want to come along too.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What has Emily got to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Show, maybe we’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s my ride.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: A payphone, anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What-</p>
<p><strong>payphone</strong>: The mobile customer you have called is
away from the phone-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Lie down, Brendan-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What time-</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’ve got a fever, you’ve got to go to the
hospital or-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Three forty. You’ve got to rest, you’re
feverish.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Get back in the car, I’m taking you home,
you’re sick, you need-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Get back in the car.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Do it! Will you do it? I need you to do
this. I need you, here. Please.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What are you doing, Dode?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You gonna stop me?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What do you think you’re doing, Dode?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: I saw you. I saw what you did.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What’d you see?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What’d you see me?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You were with her, dead, and you took the
body.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah, I did. That’s all you saw? What about
before?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Before what?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Did you see who killed her before I got
there?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You killed her.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I found the body, Dode.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You, I thought you didn’t, but we figured out,
I got the news on ya, cause you hid the body, why wouldn’t-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Who’s ‘we’?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Shut up! You’re always talking, always this
and that smartso, you’re gonna shut up now!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I didn’t kill her, Dode.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You’re not going to talk this!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Dode, I know you’re thinking of Em, I know
you tried to help her-</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Shut up! You’re gonna shut your</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: -so I’m telling you now you’re in over your
head, you don’t want to put your hand in this-</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Shut up! She’s dead, you-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Why was she scared, Dode? She came to me,
who was she scared of? I think I know why, I just gotta know who!</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You’re trying to confuse me.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Dode.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You couldn’t stand it. Your little Em. She was
gonna keep it, it was mine, and you couldn’t stand that.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What was yours?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: I had you pegged.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What was yours?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: I loved her. And I woulda loved the kid. I’m
gonna bury you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. runoff tunnel - day</strong>: Brendan slides down the
embankment, landing on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What’d I miss?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He says he
knows where the body’s at. And he says he wants more money than I think
the information’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That so, Dode?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Plenty.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Plenty, he says.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail. He’s
a pot skulled reef worm with more hop in his head than blood. Why pay
for dirt you can’t believe?</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You’ll believe this.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Maybe you will.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You’ll believe it, cause it’s someone close to
you. Real close.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Maybe it’s hot, but it’s Dode, you can’t
trust it.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: Real close.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’m getting my shoes wet for this. Let him
milk you if you want.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Stay. It’s still too much.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: No it’s not. You won’t complain when you hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: So maybe you should.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: You had her against the wall with the brick
-</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: I know my business. It’s still too much.</p>
<p><strong>dode</strong>: It’s not, cause that’s not why she was killed,
and it’s real important to you, cause the person who killed her’s real
close, and cause he’s got a lot to lose, and he knows if I don’t bury
him by spilling to you I spill to the bulls and bury him for real, and
he’s really really scared - she had a kid in her and he couldn’t stand
-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tug, it’s alright!</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Tug, stop.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: She sprung it on me, just. That’s a hell of
a thing to spring on a guy. I don’t remember much. Laura talked me down
after, said whatever, she knew her, said it wasn’t true, but I still
think sometimes. I think bout it being true. Bout it being mine. And
maybe I did it cause I thought it was true. A hell of a thing.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What’s the stats?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Everyone’s just laying low. You’re here with
us, at my folks place. They’re gone. The bulls got Dode fore the tide
took his body.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tide?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, strong tide, would’ve taken the body,
like out to sea. It can do that. But the fuzz got there first.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: War?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: You’re with us.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: The hell I am.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: So just lie low. Sleep some more. Laura, she
said you should sleep.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Brendan?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Are you - what, man, have you heard about
Dode-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I was there.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: You-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Where were you yesterday? I called.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off. I
just now got it back.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright, listen-</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Just listen. Is my name in the papers with
the story?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright. Is it just Dode in the papers?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah. What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Listen, I’m going to be calling you
tonight, probably late. Sleep with your phone on. Could you get a car if
you needed to?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: If it’s late enough I could take my
mom’s-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Be ready then. I’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Brendan. Did you hear about Dode?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You scheming tramp. You set that poor kid
up, you hid him, fed him your tale. You got info from Laura and held
Dode like a card till you could play him. For money!</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You’d bury me at the same time, but it was
mostly for the money. You got Dode thinking Em had his kid, thinking I
did it, and that was enough for him, but he stuck to the money cause you
had your claws in him, cause he couldn’t come away from the deal without
it and make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Sit down, you’re a mess. Russ, go get my shoes
from the wardrobe locker, would you sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Showing your ace.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Far enough.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Everyone’s paying social calls.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Laura here?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: So what are the stats?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: The stats are war, soon as the press heat dies.
And if you’re with him, you’re with him.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tug got hot. He panicked.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Tug’s been after my digs from the get go.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No. He’s been anxious cause he thought if
you found out he killed Emily you’d turn him over.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: He was right.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah, well.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: I told him to get the straight, no roughing. I
wasn’t even there.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright. So he’s a hot head. So you don’t
want him on your side, at least let’s have a pow wow fore we start
digging trenches. Maybe we can all walk away amiable enemies. What would
it take?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: I don’t know. We’d have to square everything
between us. He owes me some money.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright, but we can talk.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Yeah, alright.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tonight. Let’s clear it all before it boils
up again.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Four tonight. You’ll be here?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What’s going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: For a smart guy you aint too smart. I said
lay low.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Tug.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She was at the Pin’s.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, she’s our go-between.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Uh huh. So here’s the sit. You and the Pin
are going to pow wow, four o’clock tonight, his place. Take all the
muscle you want, you won’t need it. He wants to talk straight, and
you’re going to work with him for whatever he needs, cause you don’t
want war.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Hell I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: The Pin’s sitting on the brick profits -
hitting him now would be post. Make peace and wait for your chance.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s right, Tug. Smooth it out.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Besides, he’s got you on the Dode thing.
War’ll mean you vs. him and every bull in the burgh.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You going?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m sorry Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Don’t go tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ve got to make sure it plays out
smooth.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It’ll play however it plays without you
there.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ve got to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Cause if there’s war, I’m in it too.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well let’s just, I mean why not just run
away. Go somewhere. I’ve got a car. I’ve got an aunt in New Orleans, she
wouldn’t care. Yeah, it’s a stupid thing, but think about it, why not?
What, school? C’mon. Family?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright, stop.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I wasn’t serious, but we could go for awhile.
Just until everything clears.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Tell your boys no knuckle business.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: They’re just ready.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Your folks left a car here?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Take it and Laura’s. I’ll go first in
yours.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: The hell-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ll take the scenic route to draw off any
tailers. They’ll think it’s you, they might even radio back that you’re
alone. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Mr. Smarts.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright. Got a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: No. I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ve seen you smoke.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: I don’t smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Give me fifteen minutes, then go.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright, I warned you. Can you get the
car?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La
Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura’s inside. She hasn’t got a car, but
if she blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her. Alright? Alright?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ll call you when it gets light. Thanks,
Brain.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Talk.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: I want full assurance that any heat from Emily
and Dode is gonna be on just you. I don’t even want my name pulled in
the shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no rush, but I want your shake
that it’ll come home in not too much time.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s square. You did them after all. Lay
low it’ll blow over. Stick on this, one of you’ll dish it to bury the
other and you’ll both get the rap. As to the six, did you borrow it?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Then you owe it. Shouldn’t need a shake on
that.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Alright to both.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Good. Let’s seal it up and blow for
keeps.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Third thing. The last brick.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: That aint the point. I’m gonna start selling
it. How do I know it aint bad?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Why would it be?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Why was the last one? Cause someone got greedy.
Tug here’s had the means to swipe half and cut it bad for a long time.
Now we’re splits my loss of trust’s retroactive.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Did you, Tug?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright, so let’s shake and blow.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What would be good enough?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove it. Then
we’re square.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Hell for that! I didn’t touch your junk,
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: I wanna see it.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: To hell!</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Your not wanting to dose it’s telling me
something right here.</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Yeah, it better be! It’s telling that I’m
out from your thumb, that I aint playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple
no more!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I’ll dose it.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: If it’ll shut you two apes up I’ll take the
dose, and if I don’t die we’re all right as rain, and if I do die you
two have your war, so long as you keep it off my grave. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Fine. Tangles.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Johnny, go with him.</p>
<p><strong>tangles</strong>: The brick, it’s gone. The brick’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your boys in
my den soes you could snag it under my nose?</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No, that’s not-</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don’t know, or
sell it off to flat the war odds?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Pin, think about it-</p>
<p><strong>tugger</strong>: Alright, I did all that!</p>
<p><strong>pin</strong>: Do him!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Hey. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Library. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Did she blow last night?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No. Stayed there till six thirty, then
walked to school.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You didn’t give her a ride, did you?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: But she came straight to school from
Tug’s?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She there now?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah. Not with me, but here.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright. Tell her I wanna meet up on the
basketball field in half an hour, then go home and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>ext. administration building - later</strong>: Brendan slips
the paper under a door stenciled “VP Offices”.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Did you see it all? With Tug and the Pin?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No. I took your advice and didn’t go.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: The papers say six dead, three around the
house, one girl in the trunk of Tug’s car, and the Pin and Tug.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Tug tried to shoot his way out when the
police got there. They tied him to Dode, too. Same gun. And the
girl.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well good thing you weren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You think the girl was Emily?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You loved her.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Yeah I did.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You did all this cause you loved her. And now
it’s finished. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: No, it’s not finished. Tug pulled the
trigger on Em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out
without me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: It was you. What, you want the whole tale?
You want me to tell it to you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Tell it to me.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Alright, from the top. You had your fingers
in Brad Bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the Pin, who
you were hooked with. Emily came to you and Brad, you saw her for what
she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in. She goes on the
backburner. Meanwhile maybe you’re getting bored, maybe just greedy, so
when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. You hook
one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad. Maybe
accidentally, maybe to down the Pin’s operation, doesn’t matter. You put
it back, but poor Frisco doses off it and lands in a coma. So now the
Pin’s fuming, maybe he’s jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad’s crowd
looking for blood, or at least a scape. You know trouble. There’s going
to be a war over this. And there’s Emily. She trusts you. She wants in.
It’s duck soup.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You frame her for the bad brick, then you
cut her loose. You turn on your heel and bite her in the throat. Last
week on the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she saw something she was
scared of. Tug’s car driving by, the Pin driving, but she wouldn’t have
seen the Pin. No, she was across the street, angel. She saw the
passenger side. She saw you. She saw you and ran like she saw some
devil.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Brendan, why are you-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: And she took the hit. Dode hid her away,
but the Pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that
they would make good. Gave her a time, and a place. And sent Tug. Just
to get the straight. But maybe you had talked Tug up, or maybe he just
blew a fuse, but Em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did
what anyone could count on Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit for
you. You let her take it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s the tale.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You’re going to tell me it’s not?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It’s not!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You know me. I’ve only helped you. How can
you - It isn’t true!</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: I hope it isn’t. I want you to have been on
my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like Brad
and the Pin and Tug.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: But I think you knew that meeting was going
to blow up. I think that was your final play. But I hope I’m wrong. I
hope everything I wrote in the note I dropped at Gary Trueman’s office
this morning is wrong. About your and Brad’s involvement in the Pin’s
runnings. I hope you didn’t steal the brick last night. In your
purse.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: That’s good. That means you didn’t let me
walk into a slaughterhouse. You didn’t lead Tug and the Pin and their
crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman reads the note, takes my cue
and searches your locker, he won’t find a damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Brendan… don’t…</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Done. Well. That’s most of it. 9 out of 10. I
told Em to tell Tug it was his. Told her it would soften him up. She
said she wished she could keep it, but she didn’t love the father. I was
going to drive her down the next day, we’d found a doctor. Most
wouldn’t. She was starting to show. 3 months. You know whose kid that
makes it, or have you known all along?</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: You get your straight?</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah. I wouldn’t have-</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: S’alright.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah, well. Chuck Burns came to. The
knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls, guess Brad Bramish hired him. On
his own, just a grudge thing.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Yeah, you too.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: She called me a dirty word.</p>
<p><strong>the brain</strong>: Alright, you don’t have to tell me.
Thick.</p>
<p><strong>brendan</strong>: As what-all.</p>
