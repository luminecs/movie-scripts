<h1 id="cherry-falls">cherry-falls</h1>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I said no.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: But you don’t really mean it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yes I do. Keep it in your pants Rod.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Maybe it won’t stay in.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Maybe you better just drive me home.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Let me just ask you a serious question
first.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Aren’t you worried you could die a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah. I’m extremely worried about that. It’s
right up there with global warming.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us
head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us
instantly. We’d never experience what it means to make love.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: If sheep don’t count.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: That wasn’t me …</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I know. I’m kidding you. Chill out.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Well I’m trying to be real here and you’re
mocking me.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m sorry, but you’re not going to die a
virgin Rod.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Rod!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You’re being unfair.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Unfair?!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Yes. Unfair to me.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Stacy! I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Please get back in the car, Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Rod?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Is that you Rod?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Come out Rod. This SCREAM bull shit ain’t
gonna work with me!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Rod? You’re freaking me out. Game’s over. I
lose. Come out and we’ll fuck.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Stacy?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Stacy?!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: So? You’re already late. A few more minutes
won’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I got to get home.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay
out later than you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Kenny….</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: You know, maybe we ought to start seeing
other people.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Jody, we’ve been going out for over a year. I
love you but I’m all out of patience.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: It’s almost ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Daddy you scared me!</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: You’re grounded Friday night!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What? I WAS AT SANDY’S I JUST</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little
miss.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: You said that two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11
on school nights and 1 on weekends!</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: They’re not all the sheriff’s daughter.
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hello. One second. Hey Adolph, it’s the
station!</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Hello. What?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Two kids were found mutilated in the woods.
Lock the door after me.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Her parents reported her missing about an
hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What kind of a person wakes up in the morning
and says to themselves, ‘Think I’ll nail a sixteen year old girl to a
tree today’?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: The same type that decides to carve into her
stomach.</p>
<p><strong>classmate 1</strong>: Jody!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>classmate 2</strong>: Was Stacy raped?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I dunno. My dad never came home last
night.</p>
<p><strong>classmate 1</strong>: I bet she was. I heard someone stuffed
a tent spike up her ass.</p>
<p><strong>classmate 2</strong>: Gives new meaning to the idea of
getting ‘nailed’.</p>
<p><strong>classmate 1</strong>: Ha-ha. So funny. Sickfuck.</p>
<p><strong>mr. marliston</strong>: No one understands what leads people
to do irrational things. We only know that unpunished violence festers,
then explodes.</p>
<p><strong>marliston</strong>: Witness the L.A. Riots. Years of police
brutality in forty-eight hours. Jody?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Yes Mr. Marliston?</p>
<p><strong>mr. marliston</strong>: Your dad’s in the principal’s office.
He wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You aren’t planning to tell these kids that
‘virgin’ was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: But I am going to have to question all of
their past boyfriends and girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fine, just don’t mention the carving This is
going to be a tough enough day as it is.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Hi honey.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hi Jody.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I just wanted to check that you were
okay?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’m fine. I’ve just never had someone my age
die before. It’s so weird.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: How well did you know Stacy and Rod?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’ve been in the same class with Stacy for
years but we weren’t tight or anything.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Had either of them broken up with someone
recently? Hurt someone?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No. Those two were together before Kenny and I
started hanging out and that’s over, what, God a year now.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I want you to head right home after
school.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I will. Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Could you tell Mr. Marliston we’d like to see
him.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Why’d you send for Lenny Marliston?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The kids adore him. They confide in him. His
patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins.
Why didn’t you ask Jody that?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: She’s my daughter, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: So you just don’t point blank ask your
teenage daughter about sex.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why not? You worried you might find out how
much she actually knows?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You rang?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Come in Leonard. Have you met Brent Marken?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: No but I’ve always wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Nice to meet you too. My daughter speaks
highly of you.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: We have the same color eyes.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I guess we do.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Go sit next to him.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Mark Shale.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Don’t you want to talk to him? You watch him
eat everyday.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t watch him eat everyday.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch.
Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can
eavesdrop too.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You eventually have to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each
other eat and they’ve been married for twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Jody!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No! That’s his table.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You’re going to look really amoebic splitting
off from me now.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Did your dad question you this morning?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did he ask you if Stacy and Rod has ever
exchanged bodily fluids?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: He asked Marliston.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: If they had ever gone all the way?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I wonder why it’s so important to know if
they fucked?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What I don’t understand is why they asked
Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I never fucked Rod.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: If I’m so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to
hook me up non-stop?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: As fucking if.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You’re a shitsucking liar!</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Better than being a ‘cocksucking’ liar!</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Shut your face!</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: He’s been telling people….</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You can tell me all about it in my office.
Calm down. We’re all on edge today.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What’s up with that?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Dylan’s been telling people that Annette gave
him a blow job.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: And she didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There’s a better chance that he got head from
all five Spice Girls.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: That’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I think it’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Me too. I’m going to start telling people that
I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I would if Dylan paid me.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What am I supposed to say? ‘Nice sweater
Mark’? ‘Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer’s?’</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You could tell him you really liked the way he
chews with his back molars.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You’re so fucking lucky your dad is the
sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You are ‘sp fucking’ wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton.
Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: But you can’t do any of it. So it sucks. I
always have to ‘set an example’.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: He’s just trying to mess with your head.
Ignore him.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Does she fuck?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I doubt it. Who’d want to fuck her. She
probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Mr. Jenkins called on me in class today. It
was so embarrassing. I was seriously spaced. I’d been thinking about
Kenny for over twenty minutes. When I snapped out of it, I looked
pathetic. I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: That I was sorry. I’d drifted off. That I’d
been thinking about Stacy and Rod.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh nice save.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I was desperate. It was gross.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Kenny’ll come running back. This is just his
way of pressuring you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: He says he loves me.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Personally I think he has a deep, almost
pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that’s a type of love.
I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Maybe I should blister through a bottle of
Tequila and just fuck his brains out.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You’re the one always saying ‘Just do it’.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: That was before he pulled this ‘Dick me or I
dump you’ shit. I say fuck his best friend.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I don’t know what I’m so scared of.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL,
flirt with some married men, head into a private S&amp;M chat room . .
.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: How do you know what to type back when they
start to cyber with you.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I keep a couple of my dad’s porno books
hidden in my desk for emergency reference.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I promised I’d go right home after school.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: OK. increase the peace.</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: HI. Annette?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: I’m Lisa Sherman. Dylan’s aunt. He asked me
to come talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: He feels terrible about those things he said
to you in school.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: He should. Four guys hit on me today, and
not because they find me intellectually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: I think I know how to restore your
reputation.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: Can I come in? I’ll need to use the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Annette. We’re home.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Annette?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Annette!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Annette?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Is Jody still awake?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: She just turned off her light.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Hi honey.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I have a question to ask you. A personal
question.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: How personal?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I need to know how far you and Kenny
went?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Well, I assume you let him kiss you?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I’m not criticizing. Did you two get any
further?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: How much further?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Daddy! I DON’T THINK THIS IS</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Not much further.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: You never went, uh, all the way?</p>
<p><strong>joy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Daddy, are you upset that I’m still a
virgin?!</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No honey.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You are upset.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I thought you’d be pleased.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I am. I’m so very proud of you. Go back to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: She’s still a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Did you warn her?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No. Let her get at least one more peacefully
night’s sleep.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: If I’d gone public with this yesterday
Annette Michaels might be alive today.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don’t feel
guilty about?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: is there anything you do?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Focus on the present. You always want to change
the past. Let’s figure out what you are going to tell the parents today,
not what you should told them yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I’m going to tell them everything I know. I’m
calling a town meeting for eight p.m.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You tell these people someone is out there
killing virgins and we’re going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our
hands.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Better than a pile of dead teenagers.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I think you all know why I CALLED THIS Town
meeting. In the last two days, three of our children have been murdered
and it appears that we have now established a common link between the
killings.</p>
<p><strong>father 1</strong>: Well, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: All three of the victims attended our public
high school and all three were or appear to have been…um…virgins.</p>
<p><strong>mother 1</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>mother 2</strong>: You’re almost positive that’s who this
monster is targeting?</p>
<p><strong>mother 1</strong>: Virgins?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: We found the word ‘virgin’ written at both
crime scenes.</p>
<p><strong>father 1</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us this yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: We didn’t think this was a serial killer. We
thought it was an isolated incident.</p>
<p><strong>mother 3</strong>: Are you close to an arrest?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I can’t say we are.</p>
<p><strong>father 2</strong>: What are we supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mother 2</strong>: What are we supposed to tell our kids?</p>
<p><strong>father 2</strong>: To go out and get laid if they wanna feel
safe?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I think that’s’ up to each and everyone of
you.</p>
<p><strong>father 3</strong>: I can’t lock my daughter in the
basement.</p>
<p><strong>father 2</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about it Victor.</p>
<p><strong>father 3</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>father 2</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>father 3</strong>: What are you saying about my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>father 2</strong>: Calm down. I was joking.</p>
<p><strong>father 3</strong>: Hell of a time to be joking about a thing
like that you sick bastard!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Sandy, you have to chill out, at least
two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can’t butcher
all of us.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Not that many.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You watch. There’s going to be a hymen
holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I’ll finally talk to Mark Shale.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Andy! I’m on the phone!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I just wanted to offer my services to
Jody.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Your services?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m willing to help save her life. Jody, if
you want to come over right now. We could slip up into the attic for a
few minutes. There’s an old mattress up there…</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: Are you Jody?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: I’m Kenny’s Aunt Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Kenny’s aunt?</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: On what side of the family?</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: His mother’s side.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: His mother’s an only child.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: It was a she.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: She said she was Kenny’s aunt Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: This will relax her.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: She’s underage.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh my god. ARE YOU OK?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Someone tried to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: The phone just went dead. I called the police
and ran right over as fast as I could.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re wearing a skirt?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Bye mom.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m not fucking you. Not for all your
CDS.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You want me to die? I thought you and I were
tight.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes
to impress the empress?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe
you’d do all this just to get a dip or two.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hi Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did you want something?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yes. I was just curious Mark, if you brought
a Twinkie today?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You wonder about that everyday Sandy?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Shut up Ben. Actually, my mom always packs
two.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You got a great mom. I’m lucky to get a
zucchini stick.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Did you want one?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other
day and I realized I hadn’t had one in years. Then I remembered seeing
you with one.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: They’re tasty.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You can have both if you want.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No, you keep one.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: A little larger nose.</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: That’s her.</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: Brent, we got a sketch.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Who is she Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Never mind darling. You go back to school. I
don’t want you missing anymore classes today.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: IT’S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like
we’re eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I swear to God. It’s her. She told Jody she
was Kenny’s ‘AUNT LISA’. I’m getting this sickly feeling…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Calm down Brent.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I’ll call you right back.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: You were eavesdropping.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say
goodbye to you. You didn’t say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You ok?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: FINE. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Hurricane Hormone. it’s flattened the whole
school. Guess what?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Mark invited me to the party.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What party?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Shh. Ben’s party. Tonight. Haven’t you
heard?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You can’t tell your parents.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Especially not your dad.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s like a pop your cherry party. Everyone’s
saying it’s ‘Fuck or Die’ time.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You’re thinking of sleeping with Mark
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Unless he makes a move during seventh
period.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Didn’t you have something a little more
romantic in mind for your first time?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I kind of like the idea that we can all lose
it together, on the same night. It’ll be a lot less scary. You have to
go.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Stag?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Kenny’ll want to go with you. Cindy’s holding
a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I can’t right now.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Jody, you have to go to the party. For your
own safety.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You all are such hypocrites. All year long
you sit on your judgmental little butts and call me the slut from hell.
NOW YOU RUN TO ME, quaking in fear, BEGGING for advice…</p>
<p><strong>hypocrite girl 1</strong>: Yeah. SO?</p>
<p><strong>hypocrite girl 2</strong>: What were we supposed to call you
Cindy?</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: The slut from heaven?</p>
<p><strong>girl 3</strong>: Just answer our questions please?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>girl 3</strong>: What to do.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You have to do everything Boys are totally
clueless when it comes to sex.</p>
<p><strong>girl 2</strong>: Please don’t say they need our help with
that.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Always. Unless you want them to just poke
around endlessly.</p>
<p><strong>boy 1</strong>: Romeo here asked me if chicks has two holes
or three.</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: I did not.</p>
<p><strong>boy 1</strong>: You did so.</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: I was kidding.</p>
<p><strong>boy 3</strong>: Were not dude.</p>
<p><strong>boy 1</strong>: I know it’s a total bummer that three kids
are dead, but, I’m sorry, this is kind of great.</p>
<p><strong>boy 3</strong>: I’m way into this. This may be the best of
all possible worlds.</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: No. The killer could be offing chicks who
haven’t given head.</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: Then I’d only have to worry about one.</p>
<p><strong>homely girl 1</strong>: We’ll meet someone at the party.</p>
<p><strong>homely girl 2</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>homely girl 1</strong>: If we don’t, we sit back and watch
everyone else camel. That’s got to be better than hanging at your
house.</p>
<p><strong>homely girl 2</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>homely girl 1</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>homely girl 2</strong>: Ok. Pick me up at seven.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Are you O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I heard you got attacked.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I was worried about you. Did you hear about
the bash?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Yeah. I think it’s really sick.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Three of our classmates are dead. That’s not
really the occasion for a party.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with
me.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Did Sharon say no?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: You know I want to go with you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’m so flattered but I can’t. I’m
grounded.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Everyone’s grounded. There’s a killer on the
loose.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No I’m really grounded. When I got in late the
other night, my father was waiting up for me.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: If you don’t want to go with me just say so.
Say ‘Kenny, I DON’T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU’ but don’t use your dad as
an excuse. I’m so sick of it.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’m not using him as an excuse.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Yes you are. You always do. It’s why we broke
up. You always hide behind him.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I do not.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I feel like I NEED YOU DAD’S permission just
to kiss you. Jody, it’s time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An
individual. I’m going to this party tonight. Jimmy’s my ride. Come over
to my house after school. We’ll go together.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I have to go home after school. I have
something really important I have to ask my mom.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: They’re not picking me up until six.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: A series of savage killings has turned
this small community of Cherry Falls, Ohio inside out. In the last two
days, three teenagers have been killed, a fourth attacked. The killer
seems to be targeting high school virgins. Here’s our WWJB reporter Mike
Stanton outside the local high school with an up to the minute
report.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hi, I’m Mike Stanton.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hi mom.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hi princess.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I need to ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You can ask me anything.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa
Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Lisa Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Yeah. Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t know. Where did you hear that
name.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I
he thinks she’s the killer.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: That’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Did he say anything else about her?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No but he got really weird. Like I’ve never
seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I’ve never heard of her. Maybe something else
was on his mind.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No. I think she lived her a long time ago.
Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: The library. I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What’s the address? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: You found her?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: There’s a Lisa Shermer living just sixty
miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: We need you here. I can bring her in.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No. I’ll handle this.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: Sir, we’re getting calls from other
towns. Boys throughout the country have heard about what’s going on here
and they’re heading our way, apparently, looking for girls.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Put a squad car at every entrance to
town.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Your wife’s on line three.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I can’t talk to her now.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: There’s a problem with Jody.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Tell her she has to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is
planning to have a big party tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Should we close down any eruption?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: We’re seeing all the signs in town.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I like the idea of all the kids in one place.
If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I’ll be
back in a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town
papers?</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: They’re all on microfiche. What year
are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Twenty eight years ago.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: This place is empty.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: Everyone’s getting ready for the
party.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You heard about that?</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE
LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Don’t you think it’s sick?</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: Not at all. In fact, I thought about
going.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You Miss Dunlop?</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: Unfortunately I qualify. Think I’m too
old?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunlop</strong>: You’re sweet. I really wish someone had
thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been
very different.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Is that you Miss Dunlop?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Mom? You were spying on me.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I want you to come home with me right now,
Jody.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: She’s nobody you should be concerned
with.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look
exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that
concerns me.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Don’t make me order you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You going to drag me out and me in my room
until I go to college?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: If I have to. Please let me protect you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’m not leaving. I want to know why you and
dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Years ago, something horrible happened in
this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth
Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Attacked how?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: She was raped. At least that’s what she
claimed.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You didn’t believe her?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad
shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They were children of our leading citizens,
stars of the football team. And she was a loner. An angry girl that no
one really liked. She’d called them ‘queers’.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: People thought these guys had a right to rape
her because she called them ‘queers’?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They were proving to her they weren’t. They
were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are
sexually bottled up today….</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: And the police did nothing?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: How could you?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t know. We just did. I guess I was kind
of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: The word is Mob.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I’ve regretted it ever since. Never run with
the herd just because they’re the herd.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Who were they?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: The men. Do any of them still live around
here?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Two men left town right after it
happened.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You’re not telling me something.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Mr. Sisler was one of them.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: The principal?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Who was the fourth?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: God. It’s like everything that was ever
repressed in this town is suddenly bubbling up through the ground.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: THAT’S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was
one of them.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Not a day has gone by where your for what
happened. We both have…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: He dedicated his life to law enforcement
after…</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I’m looking for Lisa Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: You know where I can find her?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: St. Michael’s.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: She works at a church?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: She resides there. Out back. She died a
year and a half ago.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: A bullet to the right cerebellum.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: She was murdered?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: No. She ate a pistol for lunch one
day.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Can you describe her? How old was she?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: I never met the woman. I’m just taking
care of the place until they sell it.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Can you get inside?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: I can.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It’s extremely
important that I get inside and try to verify that it’s the same woman
who lived here.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: I don’t give a fuck what your reasons
are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a
warrant.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Jody! Yes! You’re here.</p>
<p><strong>kennt</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Is there a picture of her somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy
woman when you knew her?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Couldn’t tell she going to off herself,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No, you couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: I’ve been in a lot of people’s houses and
this one’s the creepiest.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Yeah. You should check downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: People always keep their secrets in their
attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place
in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: They look like they’d fit you. Three
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad
is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: My dad acts like he’s Johnny Fucking Perfect
and he’s really Johnny Fucking Rapist.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I think this is a big part of growing up.
It’s losing your spiritual virginity. It’s when you finally discover
that your parents aren’t anything they told you they were. They’re even
bigger hypocrites than your friends.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I can’t believe I listened to one word of his
shit.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: But if he’d been sent to jail, there would be
no Jody.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: So I should feel happy that he got away with
it?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I don’t know. I kind of am.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Are you coming to the party?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Let’s just start a party right here, right
fucking now.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Tom? Lisa Sherman is dead. But you’ll never
believe what I found out. Meet me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a
half hour. We need to talk in private.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What’s wrong? Am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Just making me feel like a piece of meat.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’m making you feel like meat?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You break up with me because I won’t fuck
you.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: That’s not why we broke up.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You flaunt some slut in my face.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Sharon’s far from a slut.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: And when I finally agree to spread my legs,
you accuse me of treating you like meat.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Jody, you’re only doing this to get back at
your dad. It doesn’t have that much to do with me.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Please don’t go. Please. Stay, We’ll just
talk. Then go to the party.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: This party is sick.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Jody. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I’m scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go
to this party.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny.
Just don’t spew out all that ‘be an individual, assert yourself’ crap
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I know where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Your brother told us.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Daddy….</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Shh. I’m not going to tell you not to go.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You’re not?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: No. I couldn’t do that. I have something for
you.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Lisa, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Just think of it like she’s having a flu shot.
Purely preventive.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 1</strong>: There’s Jan and Heather. Let’s grab them
quick before someone else does.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 2</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 1</strong>: Hide your laptop here.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 2</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 1</strong>: You can’t bring it.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 2</strong>: I’m not leaving it here.</p>
<p><strong>girl in window</strong>: Marisa! Find someone fast. Floor
space is almost gone.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 2</strong>: Ever play QUAKE?</p>
<p><strong>homely girl 2</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nerd 2</strong>: A computer game.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I get all your CDs.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not my imports.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and
your K2 snowboard.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s an awful lot for ten minutes of
beasting?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Don’t flatter yourself. You’ll be lucky to
last ten seconds with me Ben.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Are you O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I’m ok.</p>
<p><strong>car owner</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You don’t look OK.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: My house is just a couple of blocks away.
Why don’t you come on over and clean those cuts up.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your
car?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Can you just follow me? The back is
full?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You aren’t going to the party?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You know about that too?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: of COURSE. You’re not scared?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Of course I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Then you should go.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You think I should go to the party,
Mr. Marliston?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I really do. For your own safety.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I just feel so manipulated. By everyone. My
dad, my boyfriend, and now some psychopath I don’t even know.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: We’re all manipulated. From the moment
we’re born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before
I was even born.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all
people should understand that. This may sting.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Me? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Because of your father. The way what his
sins shaped you.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What do you know about my father?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: He’s a rapist. Like mine.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: _</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who
that is?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I was born nine months after she was raped.
One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which
one.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: You’re the killed.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes that’s the whole point. This is what I
was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal
its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I’ve planned this since I was
a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast
a shadow that you’ve never eluded.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You’re so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: So are you.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Now don’t be nervous.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You’re the one who’s hand is shaking.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 2</strong>: Hey! That was a 3k machine.</p>
<p><strong>nerd 1</strong>: Told you to hide it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: One more time.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I get the imports.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ok!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You ok?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Just thinking about something.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: There’s going to be very few virgins left in
school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer
isn’t caught.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I guess so. Luckily we won’t have that
problem.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I got to go.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I’m worried about someone.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You can’t just leave me here.</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: Stay put Sharon. I’ll hop on over when
I’m done here.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: You will not!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Jody was right, this party IS sick.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: ‘It’s a family affair, It’s a family
affair.’</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well, we may be family One in four
chance.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Sheriff Brent, you will be the second of
the four horsemen of the apocalypse to die. But first you will watch as
I slice up your little girl.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You’re shaking too much. If you don’t stop
shaking Jody, I’ll have to kill before I carve. We wouldn’t want
that.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: My mother said, after you and your three
droogs raped her Brent, that people in town refused to let her use their
bathrooms. Is that true? Did people really call her a slut and tell her
‘you can’t shit here’? She used to snarl that at me. That’s all she
really did, at least in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me,
she saw only you.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or will I
cause her much more pain.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Hello? Jody?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Who the fuck is breaking into my house?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: My wallet’s on the mantle when you’ve
finished your rifling, Kenny.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Oh, hey Mr. Marliston. W-What’s Jody’s bike
doing on your front porch?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: That all depends Kenny. Depends on why the
FUCK you’ve broken into your history teacher’s house?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Alright, Marliston, I know she’s here.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What are you talking about? No one here but
us chickens.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: That was Jody!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Somebody help!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Jody?!</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Jody run!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: My dad’s down there!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: He’s dead! We’ve got to get the fuck out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I can’t walk. I think he cut right through a
tendon.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Climb on.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Go to the police station!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Deputy Webber’s at the party. It’s only three
blocks away.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Fuck! It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: We just found another body.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Who’s?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school.
Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his
tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped
off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Jesus. Any word from Brent?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Nope. The switchboard is lightning up
downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks
and at the high school. It’s turning into WOODSTOCK except there’s no
concert.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Call Brent on the horn. See where he is.
What he wants us to do. I’ll head over to the school.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Don’t leave this party until you hear from
me.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: But I shouldn’t shut it down?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: No. Hell, it’s the quietest goddamn party
I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Thanks for coming back for me.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Brent? Come in Brent.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Jesus Christ had balls in his soup,
Marliston, what’d you do, eat out a pizza or something? What the fuck
happened to your face?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Hey, look, Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You really are a god damn rube.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: ‘Family affair. Oh yes it’s a family
affair’.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Where are the police?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Oh GOD IT’S HIM!</p>

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You fucked me up!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You gave me a ‘D’.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m sure you should have failed.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I was grounded for two fucking months because
of you!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Jimmy leave him alone! He’s imbalanced.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Please get out of my way or I’ll have to
hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing
those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: He’s dangerous Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So am I! I’m gonna rip your cock off
