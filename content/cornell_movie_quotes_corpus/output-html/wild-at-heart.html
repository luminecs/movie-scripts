<h1 id="wild-at-heart">wild-at-heart</h1>
<p><strong>w i l d a t h e a r t</strong>: a love story</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh my God! … Why they doin� that?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Who the hell knows. What you have in your
mouth?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Spit it out!!! … Pull your teeth out …
doctor said. What you tryin� to do? SPIT IT OUT!!!</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Hello… Who is this?…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: …Sailor Ripley… Can I talk to Lula?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: There�s no way in hell you can speak to
her and…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What?…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: …Yes you heard me… Don�t ever call back
here again.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Mama???</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: You know who it was and you know you
aren�t, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER… End of story.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Like hell.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: I can dig this music… But not that
singer.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Why?… He�s right in the groove.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: He�s so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts
ain�t quite my type.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Seein�s how you�re about as thick as a used
string of unwaxed dental floss, don�t know how you can criticize.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab
turns into dick at midnight, he�s a liar.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: So, Sailor�s gettin� out soon, and you�re
gonna see him?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Meetin� him at the gate. That phone call this
afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama�s hid the keys to my car. But
of course, I know exactly where they are.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: I didn�t hate me so much, I�d feel better
wishin� you luck.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Can�t all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo
prob�ly wouldn�ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn�t kicked
his ass out.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: So you�re gonna be needin� the �blue-bird�
pretty soon?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Real soon … I�ll be makin� the swap tomorrow,
and thanks again, Beany.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Where�s Johnnie? He�s not in his
office.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Haven�t seen �im yet today, Marietta.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Well I gotta find him - right this
minute!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Hey baby…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Peanut…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Hey, my snakeskin jacket… Thanks, baby… Did
I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my
individuality and my belief in personal freedom?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: �Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at
the Cape Fear, and guess what?… I hear Powermad�s at �The
Hurricane.�</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Stab it and steer.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Did you ever think somethin� like about the
wicked witch of the east comin� flyin� in?… Did you ever think somethin�
and then later think you�ve said it out loud to someone?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I really did miss your mind while I was out
at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your
head works is God�s own private mystery. What was it you was
thinkin�?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Well, I was thinkin� about smokin� actually…
My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole �em
from her beginnin� in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my
own, I bought those. Now I�ve just about settled on Mores, as you
probably noticed? They�re longer.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I guess I started smokin� when I was about
six… My mama was already dead from lung cancer…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What brand�d she smoke?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Camels, same as me… Guess both my mama and
my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Gee, Sailor. I�m sorry, honey. I never would
have guessed it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It�s okay. I hardly used to see them anyway.
I didn�t have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin�
that at my parole hearin�. He was a good ol� boy, stood by me… Even
brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�d stand by you, Sailor … through
anything.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I
planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can�t ask for more than that.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You move me, Sailor, you really do. You mark
me the deepest.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You�re perfect for me, too.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told
me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their
bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he
died?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: In a fire, as I recall.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Started he couldn�t remember things? Got real
violent? Mama kept tellin� me it was on account of lead poisoning from
cleanin� the old paint off our house without usin� a mask… But I don�t
know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Finally in the middle of the one night, with
me and mama asleep upstairs … he poured kerosene over himself and lit a
match.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Near burned down the house. We got out just in
time.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: It was a year before I met you.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You have such a pretty, long neck, like a
swan.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck.
It was like on a statue it was so white?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I knew this would happen. Soon as that
piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there�d be trouble. He�s just
got some kind of influence over her I can�t decipher. There�s somethin�
wild in Lula I don�t know where it comes from. You gotta find �em,
Johnnie.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: He served his time for what he did. Another
thing… If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is -
there ain�t much can be done about it.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Don�t talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I
know what volition means, and that�s why I want Sailor Ripley off the
planet! He�s pure slime and it�s leakin� all over my baby. Maybe you
could push him into makin� some kinda move and then kill him dead. You�d
only be defendin� yourself, and with his record, nobody�d fuss.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I�ll locate Lula, Marietta, and if she�s
with the Ripley boy, I�ll give him a talkin� to and try to convince her
to come back with me. That�s about all I can do.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I�ll hire a hit man if you don�t want to
help me stop this thing. I�ll call Marcello Santos.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Now, Marietta, I am goin� to help you. And
don�t be gettin� carried away. You don�t want to be bringin� Santos and
his people into it.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: You�re just jealous of Santos cause he�s
sweet on me.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Darlin�, you ain�t seein� Santos again, are
ya?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Oh, Johnnie Farragut… Don�t you trust your
very own Marietta?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Sorry, sweetheart. Bein� in love with you
like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Well stop worryin� about me and start
worryin� about how you�re gonna get that Lula back here and away from
that murderer.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Sailor ain�t a murderer. You got to get off
that kick. And far�s I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that
involvin� Lula. Even there he was protectin� her. You oughta be thankin�
him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin� after the both of
�em. Why am I tellin� you this, you was around that night. You ought to
know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful
is all… You remember that night…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Maybe I was there, but I didn�t see
anythin�. All I know�s that trash killed a man with his bare hands.
Hands which are now prob�ly all over my baby!</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Marietta, settle down now darlin�… I want
what�s best for her, too - Like I said, I�ll do what I can to bring her
home.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor, you are somethin� else, honey… When I
was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I�d be startin� to think
about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle
Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That�s true. Uncle Pooch wasn�t really an
uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy�s? And my mama never knew
nothin� about me and him - that�s for damn sure. His real name was
somethin� kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him
Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always
figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I
was surprised more�n a little.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: How�d it happen, peanut? He just pull out
the old toad and let it croak?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You�re terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I can�t hardly understand you when you talk
with one of them Mores in your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don�t
think I care for it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old
Pooch done the deed.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin� her hair
dyed? And I was alone in the house.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the
porch, you know? Where I was makin� a jelly and banana sandwich? I
remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin� that night with
Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known
nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on
my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Didn�t he say somethin�?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Not really. Least not so I recall now.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: So how�d he finally nail you? Right there in
the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: No, he picked me up.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: He was short but powerful. With hairy arms?
Anyway, he carried me into the maid�s dayroom which nobody used. We did
it there on an old bed.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: �We� did it? Whattaya mean? Didn�t he force
you?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know?
I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there�s all different kinds of
rapes. I didn�t exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started,
it didn�t seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after
Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me
there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back
into the kitchen and finished makin� my sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: And you never told nobody about it?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or
different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a
nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years
later while he was holidayin� in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too
much traffic there for my taste… And another thing, baby… That
government of ours should be keepin� us separated from outer space…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Here she goes again…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin�.
Seems to me the government could do somethin� about it. One of these
mornings the sun�ll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet
like an X-Ray.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That ain�t never will happen, honey. Least
not in our lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You okay, honey?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That woman�s laugh creeps me out. I heard
somethin� like that… somewhere before… Sound�d like the wicked
witch…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Just sounded like an old gal havin� a good
time to me… You ready to dance?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�m always ready to dance. But I need me a
kiss first, honey. Just one?</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: I knew you�d want it again…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: That�s not why I called.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Oh yeah - sure … okay.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Santos… It isn�t.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Have it your way… But you want it.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Lula�s gone off with Sailor.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: What do you want me to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I want you to take care of Sailor, so he
won�t ever be able to bother my baby again.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Take care of him?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: What does take care of him mean?… Do you
want me to give him food or some clothing?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: What�s with you?… You know what take care
of him means. I don�t call Santos except for one big reason.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Big is the key word, and I�m telling you I
want it bad.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I want you to get rid of Sailor.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Get rid of him?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Yes… Get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: How would I do that? Send him on a trip -
like maybe to Hawaii?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Santos, why in hell do you insist on
playin� this stupid game?</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Just tell me what you want.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I don�t need to explain anymore�n I have…
You know damn well.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: You need to explain it.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: All right… I want you … to … kill …
Sailor… As simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Simple? Kill him?… How?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: That�s your business… I don�t care
how.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Like an accident where maybe Lula might also
get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: NO… For God�s sakes, Santos!</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Well, like kill him with the atomic
bomb?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Santos…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Explain it… I told you.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Shoot him? Like with a gun?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Where?… In the leg?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: In the head.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun… Now I�m
beginning to get it… You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a
gun.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: But where in the head?… Not the chin, I
hope.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No… In the brains… What little I�m sure he
has.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains
with a gun.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Through the forehead?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Wrong! It�s much better to blow a hole in
the back of the head … right toward the bridge of the nose … Lots and
lots of irreparable damage.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: See! I knew you had it all under
control.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Why didn�t you send Johnnie Farragut?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Maybe I did… Try New Orleans first… Lula
can�t ever stop talkin� �bout that town.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: On one condition…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: You give me your permission to kill Johnnie
Farragut.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Santos… No… Please, Santos…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: You�re not tellin� me that you�re sweet on
him?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No… But…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: One day he�s gonna find out what we�re up to
with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: I�m gonna take your silence as a �yes�…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Santos… I can�t…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Shhhh… It�s all right… Also, I either take
you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: You fucker, don�t you ever touch Lula -
You fucker, I�ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Put your shoulders back.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Put your shoulders back, I said.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: You got nice tits.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Someone�s gonna see us.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: That�s just another part of the price to
pay.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Santos… You kill that Sailor, otherwise
he�s gonna turn my baby against me.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Look at me… There�s no turning back on this…
I�m gonna kill Sailor… That�s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Are you going to provide me with an
opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save youself
some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?</p>
<p><strong>idiot punk</strong>: Don�t fuck with me, man. You look like a
clown in that stupid jacket.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it�s
a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.</p>
<p><strong>idiot punk</strong>: …Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor, honey…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I�m sorry to do this to ya here in front of
a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my
girl.</p>
<p><strong>idiot punk</strong>: I�m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong
girl is all.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That�s good… Now go get yourself a beer. You
fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had… Y�all know this one?…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Why didn�t ya sing �Love Me Tender�? … You
told me that was your favorite love song.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: �Cause I�m only gonna sing that song to my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What you want to watch this trash for? Ain�t
one of those people have a real thought in their brain.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That so? You want to tell me what, if any,
real thoughts you had lately?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What you have to get personal about so quick?
All I mean is you could possibly read a book.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What�s that honey?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We didn�t have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby,
you know?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�m sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments
where all you been the last two years.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all.
Don�t need to make more�n it was. This couple�s goin� on a date to
Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Don�t the reject guys get anythin�?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried
Chicken.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That don�t seem fair.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Hell, why should the Datin� Game be
different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin� to
eat.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Wouldn�t it be fabulous if we somehow stayed
in love for the rest of our lives?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You think of the weirdest damn things to say
sometimes, peanut. Ain�t we been doin� a pretty fair job this far?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It�d
make the future so simple and nice.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: At Pee Dee, all you think about is the
future, you know? Gettin� out? And what you�ll do and what you�ll think
about when you�re on the outside again.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I just think about things as they come up. I
never been much of a planner.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It ain�t altogether terrible just to let
things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain�t
too proud of, but I�ll tell ya from now on I ain�t gonna do nothin� for
no good reason. All I know for sure is there�s more�n a few bad ideas
runnin� around loose out there.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You know there�s somethin� I ain�t never told
you about, Sailor, and this here�s a story with the lesson that there�s
a right time and a wrong time for things to happen… When I was almost
sixteen I got pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Musta been a lesson tellin� ya it was the
wrong time… What did you do, your mama find out?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: She got me an abortion…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: …from some old doctor with the hairiest
nostrils and ears I ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Afterwards… Momma says…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: …I hope you appreciate my spendin� six hundred
dollars, not countin� what it cost us to get here and back… This man�s
the best damn abortionist in the South.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You tell the boy who knocked you up?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks
used to visit with us summers.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Oh, nothin�. I never let on to mama about Dell
bein� the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I
didn�t tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then,
anyhow, and I didn�t see the point. Somethin� terrible happened to him,
though. Six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What�s that, peanut?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin� a hard
lesson. What I learned from observin� Dell is I think people who are
frightened want to disappear. He�d startin� behavin� weird? Like comin�
up to people every fifteen minutes and askin� how they were doin�?</p>
<p><strong>dell</strong>: How�re ya doin�?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: And just seemin� real spacey and actin�
funny.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Actin� funny how?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell�s
mama? She found cockroaches in Dell�s underwear.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin� one
big cockroach on his anus?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Hell, peanut…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: One time - real late - like about two thirty
a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin�
sandwiches in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>aunt rootie</strong>: What�re ya doin�?</p>
<p><strong>dell</strong>: Makin� my lunch!!!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Dell told her he was makin� his lunch and
goin� to work. He�s a welder? And she made him go back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Then he�d carry on about the weather? Talk
about how rainfall�s controlled by aliens livin� on earth. Also how men
wearin� black leather gloves…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: …are followin� him around.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Prob�ly the rain boys from Outer Space.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: It ain�t so funny now, though. December before
Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to
find him. He was missin� for almost a month before he wandered back in
the house on mornin� dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a
thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to
some place he said would �give him peace of mind.� Nobody�s seen him
since.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Sound like ol� Dell�s more�n just a little
confused, peanut… Too bad he couldn�t visit that ol� Wizard of Oz and
get some good advice.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Too bad we all can�t, baby… One thing about
Dell?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What�s that?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: When he was about seventeen, he startin�
losin� his hair.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: He�s twenty-four now? A year older than you?
And must be �bout bald.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: There�s worse things that can happen to a
man, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin� baby,
hair does make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I sure am glad they didn�t give you no prison
haircut… Gives me somethin� to grab hold of while we�re makin� love?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Let�s go dancin�, peanut. I�m ready.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: We gotta be careful, honey, my mama�s gonna
have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he�s one
clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could
find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways,
Sailor.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: One thing puzzles my mind, sugar… You�re
twenty years old - aren�t you ever curious why your mama has this
fixation on keepin� us apart? Puttin� a detective on us. I�ll tell ya
Lula… Well… It�s more�n me killin� Bob Ray Lemon…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too
much…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yeah, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula�s
mama?…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Well, she wants to fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Lousy fuckin� homosexuals…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What are you, sick?… I�m with Lula.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No… I just wanted to kiss you good-bye…
You know too much �bout little Lula�s mom…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Whattya mean?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive
for Clyde and Santos…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: So maybe one night you got a little too
close to the fire… And you�re gonna get burned, baby… And besides that,
you�re shit… D�you think I�d let my little girl go with shit like you?…
Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You�re gonna have to kill me to keep me away
from Lula.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Oh, don�t worry �bout that…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It�s a prob�lm I don�t think�s gonna go away
too soon though… Peanut, I�m thinkin� of breakin� parole and takin� you
out to sunny California.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You up for that?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�d got to the far end of the world for you,
baby… You know I would.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin�
to do.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: …That�s an awful long way to go, just to get
some pussy.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to
Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You still got plenty energy for me, baby.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Take a picture, bitch… It�ll last longer.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�ll slap those eyes right outta your
head.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sorry, baby… When�s the first time you done it
with a girl who wasn�t hookin�?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was
visitin� my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid�s
house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was
real tall, taller than me.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: She looked right at me and run her tongue
over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was
Irma.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What�d you say to her?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Told her my name. Then she said somethin�
like, �It�s so noisy down here. Why don�t we go upstairs so we can hear
ourselves?� She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important
lesson to learn that day.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: When she got almost to the top step I stuck
my hand between her legs from behind.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That�s just what she said. I had a boner
with a capital �O.� I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin� and
ran down the hallway. I found her lyin� on a bed in a room filled with
assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was
wearin� bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin� lacy black
stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn�t go all the way
down your leg?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You mean like pedal pushers?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: She just rolled over onto her stomach and
stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she
closed her thighs on it.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You�re excitin� me, honey. What�d she do?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Her face was half-pushed into the pillow,
and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, �I won�t suck you.
Don�t ask me to suck you.�</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Poor baby. She don�t know what she missed.
What color hair she have?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this,
sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads
her legs real wide and says to me…</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: Take a bite of peach.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Jesus, honey! You more�n sorta got what you
come for… You better rum me back to the hotel, baby… You got me hotter�n
Georgia asphalt.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Say no more… But go easy on me, sweetheart…
Tomorrow we got alotta drivin� to do. Hotter�n Georgia asphalt?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�ll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I
mean, I don�t want her to worry no more�n necessary.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What do you mean by necessary? She�s prob�ly
already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie
Farragut.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you
soon as you was sprung, but I don�t figure she counted on us takin� off
together like this… I guess this means you�re breakin� parole, then?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You guess? My parole was broke two hundred
miles back when we burnt Portagee County.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What�ll it be like in California, Sailor, do
you think? I hear it don�t rain much there.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You got about six more big states to go
before we find out.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: We got through two states already.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That don�t smell like a More.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: It ain�t. It�s part of the lessons of life. I
picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: They sure do stink.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Yeah, I guess, but - and here�s the lesson
part - they ain�t supposed to be so bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You ain�t gonna begin worryin� about what�s
bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin�
state lines with a A- Number One certified murderer.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don�t
exaggerate.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Okay, manslaughterer who�s broke his parole
and got in mind nothin� but immoral purposes far�s you�re concerned.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Thank the Lord. Well, you ain�t let me down
yet, Sailor. That�s more�n I can say for the rest of the world?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You please me, too, peanut.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Life is a bitch and then you marry one.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What kinda trash talk is that?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What it says on the bumper sticker up front.
On that pickup.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That�s disgustin�. Those kinda sentiments
shouldn�t be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Almost. I figure we should find us a place
to stay and then go eat.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Got anyplace special in mind?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not
in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut�s on our
trail he�ll check those first.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: How about that one? The Host of the Old South
Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South,
but we�ll try her.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don�t hardly
never get washed, and I don�t like the idea of lyin� on other people�s
dirt.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Come look at this.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What�s that, honey?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: There ain�t no water in the swimmin� pool.
Just a dead tree fell in, prob�ly from bein� struck by lightnin�.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: It�s huge. This musta been a grand old place
at one time.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Let�s get fed, sweetheart. The light�s
fadin� fast.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Hello there, Mr. Reindeer… Marcello Santos
speaking.</p>
<p><strong>mr. reindeer</strong>: Mr. Marcello Santos… Hey there… That
was great shit you sent in last month…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: I gotta problem… In fact, I gotta coupl�a
problems…</p>
<p><strong>mr. reindeer</strong>: Gotta coupl�a problems, huh?… For each
problem drop a silver dollar through my mail slot… With all particulars…
We�ll work out �il conto� later…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i… You can almost hear that
jazz blowin� up from the big N.O.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Lula… I learned somethin� interestin� today
on a science show I heard on the radio… How leeches is comin� back into
style.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more
shit sometimes?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Yeah, it�s a real problem for me, Sailor, you
know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw
�em by the register and the girl throw �em in. I�m not big on resistin�.
So what about a leech?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Heard on the radio how doctors is usin�
leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used
�em?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard
poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy,
though, so it was almost worth it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yeah, well listen to this… Radio said back
in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his
nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin�, they�d sew one
of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks… Then put leeches on it.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor? You expect me to believe a man�d be
goin� around with a arm sewed to his nose?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: How they used to do it. Course they got more
sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a
better idea is by insertin� a balloon in the forehead and lettin� it
hand down on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor Ripley! You stop! You�re makin� this
shit up and I ain�t gonna sit for it!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Honest, Lula. I prob�ly ain�t precisely got
all the facts straight, but it�s about what they said.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Honey, we�re goin� to bed now and it�s time to
change the subject.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We�re about dry bones, sweetheart. We don�t
wanna have to push this �bird� into New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: We sure don�t, honey… Get me a Mounds?</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Sorry, gentlemen. I�m �most finished on
my shoppin� here.</p>
<p><strong>erv</strong>: This be it?</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Y�all take American Express?</p>
<p><strong>erv</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Then lemme throw in a couple more
things.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Pussycats gotta eat, too.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: I�d just soon have a paper bag rather
than a plastic one, if it�s same to you.</p>
<p><strong>erv</strong>: We don�t have no paper bags.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Hello… Yeah, mama, I�m on my way… as he
picks up his bag Thanks for waitin�, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: All I want�s ten bucks regular. Oh yeah, and
a Mounds bar.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I ain�t got my American Express card with
me, so I gotta use cash. Hope that�s okay.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That took long enough. You forget my
Mounds?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I really do think the country done changed
just a little while I was away, peanut.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You got to keep an eye on it. That�s sure.</p>
<p><strong>mr. reindeer</strong>: A coupl�a silver dollars came my way
today… I�m sending one of them to you with a paper on the beneficiary …
As usual, you are completely free to fulfill the obligation in any
manner you so desire.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you mind if we share this table? … The
others, they are occupied.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Alright… By all means. Make yourselves at
home.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Muchas gracias.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula. But
please do call me Reggie. This is my friend, who we call Drop Shadow. He
is always with me.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Johnnie Farragut. Pleased to meet ya.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You are from New Orleans, Senor
Farragut?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North
Carolina. Here on business.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Mr. San Pedro Sula is from
Honduras.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you know Honduras, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Only that it�s supposed to be a pretty poor
sight since the hurricane came through last year.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes, that�s so. But there is not much to
destroy.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: No big buildings like in New
Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Whattaya do there?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh, many things…</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Mr. San Pedro Sula�s got an appliance
shop.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But I am also with the government.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: In what capacity?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: In many capacities.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the Secret
Service.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
Telefono 666.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He is my sponsor. The General is the head of
the secret police of Honduras.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his
operatives.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: That is my permiso.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Mr. San Pedro Sula�s permit to
kill.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Only if necessary, of course, and only in my
own country.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Mr. San Pedro Sula�s authorized to
carry a .45.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: United States Marine issue, before they made
the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have
it here, in my briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Why are you in New Orleans? If you don�t
mind my askin�.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in
fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend
of mine who is an agent for the CIA.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and
me bass fishing.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: We are in the same businesses and also we
are fishermen.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: It�s been a real pleasure. I wish you both
buena suerte wherever you go.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The same to you. If you are in Honduras,
come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of
the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a
liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the
Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the
ground first?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I couldn�t say, which one?</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They
light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of �em. Oh,
Sailor you�re so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay
attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it�s like
it�s talkin� to me when you�re inside? Like it�s got a voice all it�s
own. You get right on me.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You really are dangerously cute, honey. I
gotta admit it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Let�s head out into the crazy world of New
Orleans… I gotta get somethin� to eat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My name�s George Kovich. Bet you�ve heard of
me.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Don�t know that I have… Should I know about
you for anythin� in particular?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Was in all the papers three years ago. I�m
seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo,
New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted
�em killed.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Why were you killin� pigeons, Mr. Kovich? Were
you in the extermination business?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, ma�am. I was a housepainter, in the
union forty-one years. I�m retired now, livin� with my sister, Ida. Ida
moved down here twenty-five years ago, married an oil man named Smoltz,
Ed Smoltz. He�s dead now, so it�s just me and Ida. I sold my house and
moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business. Hell, RWW
was doin� them a service, and they charged me with endangerin� the
public.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What�s wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They�re useless pests. I�ve shot hundreds of
�em…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …My neighbors hired me to get rid of the
pigeons that gathered on their roofs and porches…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …Neighbors asked me how come the spotted
bastards didn�t light on my house or my brother Earl�s anymore, and I
told �em the truth. I shot �em… Earl�s gone now…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …Heart attack six months ago - had that
cholesterol thick as shit… His widow, Mildred, she still lives in the
house next to mine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She�s stone deaf but the racket the pigeons
made drove Earl crazy. He could hear �em even with the TV on. He owned a
bar thirty years, The Boilermaker, on Wyoming Street. Earl�s roof was a
favorite spot for pigeons. They lit there day and night. I wanted to
toss a grenade up there.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: If your neighbors didn�t mind, how�d you get
put out of business?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Woman drivin� down the street spotted me
with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over
and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one.
Cops didn�t understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal
property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger.
I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody�s cat would eat
it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn�t
make much noise and the ammo was cheap.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What happened on the charges?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar
fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the
place. You seen it. Plain filth.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It�s a serious situation. Not like the Turks
and the Armenians, maybe, or the Arabs and the Jews, but I want people
to remember me and what I�ve done and pick up where I left off. Somebody
had to make a move. It was nice meetin� you folks.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What lesson do get outta that story,
Lula?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: It�s just another case, Sailor.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What�s that, peanut?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: One person thinks he�s doin� somethin� good
and ever�body else gets upset about it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Ain�t it the way…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor?… Sailor, honey?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Ever imagine what it�d be like to get eaten
alive by a wild beast?… Sometimes I think it would be the biggest
thrill?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: My God, it better be, darlin�, cause it�d be
the last… What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Shhhhh… It�s four o�clock… That woman�s laugh
the other day had somethin� to do with this feelin�? … Like bein� ripped
apart by a gorilla, maybe… Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by
a real powerful one.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up
with some weird thoughts…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Anythin� interestin� in the world come out of
somebody�s weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up
with shit like we�re seein� these days?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You got me, peanut.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You certain?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I ain�t never met anyone come close to you,
sugar.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Recall the time we was sittin� one night
behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin� against it. And you took your
hand and put it on your heart and you said, �You feel it beatin� in
there, Lula?… Get used to it, cause it belongs to you now.� D�you recall
that?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I was hopin� you would. I know that night by
heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it�s the best night of my life.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I really do think it�s the best night of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We didn�t do nothin� special I can remember.
Just talked, is all.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Talkin�s good. Long as you got the other? I�m
a big believer in talkin�, case you ain�t noticed.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Too bad they don�t give an award for
talkin�… You�d win first prize. Especially with those tits.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You think so, baby? Does my talkin� bother
you, honey?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: No, I like gettin� up around four a.m. and
talkin� bout wild animals … Though you woke me up this time in the
middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn�t remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I
couldn�t remember any of my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What was this one?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It wasn�t no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin�
super-hard and I wasn�t dressed warm. Only instead of freezin�, I was
sweatin� strong.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: The water was rollin� off me. And I was
dirty, too, like I hadn�t had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was
black almost.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I know. I kept walkin�, I headed for your
house, only it wasn�t your house, really. You let me in only you weren�t
real pleased to see me. You kept askin�, �Why�d you come to see me now?
Why now?� Like it�d been a long time since we�d seen each ohter.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Oh, baby, what an idea. I�d always be happy to
see you, no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I know, peanut. But it wasn�t all like you
were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein� there was
upsettin� to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess
you�d got married and your husband was comin� home any minute.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I tell you, Lula. I was shakin� wet. All
this black sweat was pourin� off me, and I knew I was scarin� you, so I
took off.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sometimes dreams just don�t mean nothin�…
Stuff comes into your mind and you don�t have no control over, you know?
Anyways, dreams ain�t no odder than real life. Sometimes not by
half.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Well, I ain�t upset about it, darlin�. Just
give me an odd feelin� there a minute, is all.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Take a bite of Lula.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Hey!!!… Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my
man.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Real good, Chet… It�s been awhile.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Everythin�s relative. Where�s that Marietta
Pace Fortune? You two didn�t split up, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: No… She�s fine. Back home.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: What�ll it be? The regular? Black Label?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Set one up.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: So who you out sleuthin� for now?… Can I help
ya?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Actually, I�m lookin� for Marietta�s
daughter, Lula. Her and �er beau took off the other day. Marietta�s real
upset about it.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me
somebody lookin� like her was at the Nothin� Fancy yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Sounds right… I�ll check it out.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: You hitched yet?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: No sir…</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: It�s none of my business, but when are you and
Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Not for lack of love, I can tell ya
that.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: That�s what I mean… Always looked like you was
just knocked out in love… Was real nice to see.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I�ll tell ya though, it�s comin� up to the
time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle
down… I think that time�s comin� up right soon. But like you said,
everythin�s realtive.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Let�s get outta here… I suddenly got a funny
feelin� about this place. Feelin� all that voodoo…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Gotta hex from a voodoo?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Who do?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You do.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Oh my God… It�s Johnnie… Duck down!… Get
goin�!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Never mind where… Get outta here… I mean it,
Sailor.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I�m goin�.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Ain�t love wonderful?…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What�s that?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I said, ain�t love wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Good luck to you kids.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You think he saw us?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Who knows, baby?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: He was sittin� there havin� a beignet at the
Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Lula, darlin�… Makes no difference anyway…
We�re outta here.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Sweetheart, keep your panties up. We�re in
Jimmy Swaggart country.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they
could track us.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: He�s just a regular guy�t needs help, honey.
Look at him.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Thanks a lot. I been standin� out there off
and on for two hours, ha-ha! Since noon about, ha-ha! Cops catch ya
hitchin� on a Interstate around here they throw ya on a county road crew
for a week, less you can pay the ticket, ha-ha! Which I ain�t got,
ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: My name�s Sailor, and this here�s Lula.
What�s yours?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Marvin DeLoach. But ever�body calls me Roach,
ha-ha! Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You always make that strange little funny
laugh when you talk?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Ain�t laughin�, ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What you got in the box?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: My dogs, ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I�m headed to Alaska, ha-ha! These dogs is
gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: This guy�s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Where you from, Roach?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: If you mean where I was born, it was Belzoni,
Missi�ppi, ha-ha! But I been brought up in Baton Rouge.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Why you goin� to Alaska? And where�d you get
them puppies? They look sick.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha! The Call of
the Wild. I ain�t never seen snow, ha-ha! I got these dogs at the pound.
Nobody wanted �em, ha-ha! Ever�body here got theirself pit bulls or some
kinda hounds. I�m gonna feed these boys good so they�ll be big and
powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor! Stop! Stop the car now!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�m sorry, but I can�t take this. Roach, or
whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this
instant!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�m truly sorry? I�m truly sorry, Roach. But
ain�t gonna make it to Alaska? Least not any part of the way with us.
You�d best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they
all die? And, if you don�t mind my sayin� so? You could most certainly
use some serious lookin� after yourself, startin� with a bath!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You don�t feel you was a little hard on the
guy, honey?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I know you�re thinkin� that I got more�n some
of my mama in me? Well, I couldn�t help it. Sailor, I really couldn�t.
I�m sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin� hunk of
awful-smellin� meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor
diseased puppies!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Just part of life on the road, peanut.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Do me a favor, Sailor? Don�t pick up no more
hitchers, okay?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: No, Marietta, I haven�t found �em.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: This is the kinda mistake can take a
Hindu�s lifetime to unfix… You better get a move on, Johnnie, before
that boy got her holdin� down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin� dope
up her arms.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios
swimmin� around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it
easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I�m stayin� right here by the phone until
you find Lula, then I�m comin� to get her. You call soon�s you got
somethin�, even if it�s three in the a.m.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hola! Senor Farragut! We meet again.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or
Takes-us, as they say in these parts.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I
are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Would you like to enjoy a martini with
us?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Why not? How was the fishin�?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I think they are too serious, these American
fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: So, it�s back to the islands.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday
to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary
Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp
boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I
must return and find out what happened.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: This island of yours sounds like a kind of
unpredictable place.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It has its moments of uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: But how are you finding New Orleans,
Senor Farragut?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Call me Johnnie… N.O. has always been a
good town to sit around in.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I can tell you are an intelligent man,
Johnnie. One difference between your country and mine is that in the
islands, it does not pay to reveal one�s intelligence… Others may use
what they perceive against us…</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hasta siempre.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Hasta siempre.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you know how it came about that copper
wire was invented in Scotland?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: How�s that?</p>
<p><strong>drop shadow</strong>: Two Scotsmen were fighting over a
penny.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I gotta admit, you guys are two in four
dozen.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The real joke is we never went fishing, but
we�re still fishing.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I wouldn�t mind a little night life. How about
you?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Hard to tell what�s shakin� in a place like
this, honey. You don�t want to be walkin� in the wrong door.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Maybe there�s a place we could hear some
music. I feel like dancin�. We could ask someone.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Someone up here might know somethin�.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: Gas?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Got enough, thanks. We�re lookin� for a
place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin� - get somethin�
to eat, too. Anything like that around here?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Cornbread�s. They got western.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: No food, though, �cept bar nibbles.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: How about speed metal?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Any kinda rock�n�roll, honey.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There�s a boogie joint just about a mile
straight out Lafitte here. But that�s a black place mostly.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: Mostly black though in that boogie place.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What�s the name of it?</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: Club Zanzibar.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You say it�s straight ahead a mile?</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez
Highway. State Road 86.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You ready for this?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: We�ll find out in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>bartender zanzibar</strong>: This is a friendly place, son.
You folks just relax and have a nice time.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You got yourself a deal.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That�s a real jacket… By that, I mean a
real stupid jacket.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it
represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Fuckin� honky cracker mumbo jumbo.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�ll be damned if I�m leavin�. That band is
too good?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You notice that woman when we come in? The
white woman sittin� by herself?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Well, she ain�t talked to nobody and ain�t
nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Honey, we bein� strangers here and all, this
is the kinda place we don�t want to make nothin� of nothin�.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You think she�s pretty?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I tend to like �em with a little more meat
on the bones. Face ain�t bad, though.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What�s wrong, sweetheart? Somethin�
botherin� you?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Mama. I been thinkin� about her. She�s prob�ly
worried to death by now.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: More�n likely.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I want to call her and tell her I�m okay. That
we�re okay.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I ain�t so sure it�s a great idea, but
that�s up to you. Just don�t tell her where we are.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Pardon me? Y�all got a phone here I can
use?</p>
<p><strong>bartender zanzibar</strong>: Can�t you read?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Back in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I have a collect call from Lula Fortune.
Will you accept?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Of course! Lula? Where are you? You all
right?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�m fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not
to worry.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin�
what�s happenin� to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Are you comin� back here soon, Lula? I
need you here.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Need me for what, mama? I�m perfectly fine,
and safe, too.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: You in a dance hall or somethin�? I can
hear music behind you.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Just a place.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Really, Lula, this ain�t right!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic
Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans?
Lula, are you in New Orleans?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: No, mama, I�m in Mexico, and we�re about to
get on an airplane to Argentina!</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Argentina! Lula, you�re outta your mind.
Now you just tell me where you are and I�ll come for you. I won�t say
nothin� to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants,
I don�t care.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Mama, I�m hangin� up this phone now.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No, baby, don�t! Can I send you somethin�?
You runnin� low on money? I�ll wire you some money if you tell me where
you are.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I ain�t that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on
a crime spree? Knockin� off convenience stores all across the south?
Ain�t you read about it?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to
be all right.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I am all right, mama. That�s why I called, to
let you know. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Call me again soon? I�ll be waitin� by the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Don�t be crazy, mama. Take care of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I was just wastin� time, peanut, till you
come back.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: It�s me who�s wastin� time, Sailor, bein� with
you.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Honey, I�m sorry. It wasn�t nothin�. Come on
and get up and we�ll take off.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane
and then I see you practicin� your individuality and personal freedom
with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I�m gonna feel?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Told you not to call your mama.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Santos… If you get this message, call me
right away. It�s Marietta… I don�t know, Santos… Maybe this is all not…
Call me.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Johnnie! At last! I thought you was never
gonna come back to your room.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor
been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She
knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Did she tell you where she was callin�
from?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No, but my guess is they�re headed west,
so prob�ly Texas. Their money must be runnin� low. I don�t think Sailor
had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had
saved in the Cherokee Thrift.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: How�d she sound? Was she doin� okay?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Could she be doin� okay, Johnnie? She�s
tryin� to prove somethin� to me, that�s all. Lula ain�t doin� no more�n
showin� off, defyin� me… Johnnie, I�ve done somethin� bad…</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I won�t tell you over the phone. I�m
comin� to N.O. and I�ll tell you then.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if
I could pick up their trail.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No, you wait right there for me… I�ll be
on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: I�ll meet you, Marietta, if that�s what you
want, but I�m against it.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Seven tomorrow evenin�. Se can eat at
Galatoire�s. Fix it.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: How much we got left, honey?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Under a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if
we can get some work?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Not in Houston. We�d be better off in some
place more out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a
chance to rest.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That�d be good, Lula.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>caller #1</strong>: Artie? That you, Artie?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Yes, ma�am. What�s on your almost- perfect
mind this evening?</p>
<p><strong>caller #1</strong>: How ya feelin�, Artie? I heard you wasn�t
doin� too well recent.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: I�m fine, thank you. I had a cardiac
infarction but I�m on a new diet and exercising regularly. I�ve never
felt better.</p>
<p><strong>caller #1</strong>: Well, that�s so good to hear, Artie. You
know some of us depend on you down this way. You�re so entertainin� and
you get so many interestin� guests.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Thank you. It�s listeners such as yourself
who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the
studio as fast as I could.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Jesus! How could anyone listen to this
crap?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …live in exchange for sexual favors.
Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all
Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North
Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are
being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. �These are
really just children,� he said, �but they�ve been exposed to a lot
already.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: In international news, India plans to
release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions
of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The reptiles were supposed to be of a
docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the
breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The Indian official who supplied this
information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh
state authorities last October released five hundred turtles…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: in the Ganges near Varanasi to try and
reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour
floatin� corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What�s that, peanut?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I can�t take no more of this radio… I ain�t
never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley,
you find me some dancin� music right this minute… I MEAN IT!!</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: The world�s gettin� worse, I think, Sailor.
And it don�t sound like there�s much we can do about it, neither.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: This ain�t news, sweetheart. I hate to tell
ya.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Here�s your key. Mr. Farragut�s already
taken care of everything. I hope you�ll be comfortable, Mrs. Fortune.
You�re in room 351 right down the hall from Mr. Farragut.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I have a phone call for you,
Mrs. Fortune … at the phone by the fireplace. Please wait for it to
ring.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Yes?…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: I got your message… But you went right to
Johnnie, didn�t you?… I can�t trust you, bitch - not for one minute…
Naughty girl… Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There�s
no turning back. I�m in a killing mood.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: My very best to Johnnie… Bless his soul.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Who was that?… Who know�s your here?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I�ll be damned if that wasn�t a wrong
number?</p>
<p><strong>mr. reindeer</strong>: Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet,
eating her curds and whey… Along came a spider and sat down beside her,
and extended his hand out to play.</p>
<p><strong>mr. reindeer</strong>: Oh dear… Another Miss Dull Cunt.</p>
<p><strong>mr. reindeer</strong>: When I gave you the silver dollar I
forgot to give you the contents of this envelope. They are to be
returned. Show it just before the deed…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: What is it, Johnnie?</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Just some guys I met here… I keep seein�
�em… Now tell me…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Johnnie, I can�t tell you, honey. Is there
anyway we can get on the road tonight? We�ve got to find them kids.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Somethin� was upsettin� you bad last night,
and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so�s I
could help…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I did, honey, but that was last night…
Let�s just find those two kids before it�s too late.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Honey, I have to ask you this… Is Santos
involved in any of this?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Hell no, baby… I wouldn�ta done that
without tellin� you.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: That bastard Pucinski…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Who?… Uncle Pooch?…</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Yeah… The one that introduced Santos to you
and Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Johnnie… That�s the past… We gotta get on
to our future, sugar!</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and
I�m ready. You�re lucky cause I happen to love night drivin�.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Let�s head for Texas and see if we can
pick up the trail.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: Did I tell ya it�s great to see ya
again?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: This �bout the fifth time?</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I�ll pack my things and meet you
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: And to think what coulda happened in that
king-sized bed tonight…</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: You won�t of missed much.</p>
<p><strong>johnnie</strong>: See ya downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I�m afraid his car is gone,
Mrs. Fortune.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: I don�t understand this… I don�t
understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this
lobby. Somethin� bad has happened - I jus know it.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Perhaps we should call a local law
enforcement officer.</p>

<p><strong>lula</strong>: You knew my daddy?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yes I did… I sure did… The bad side of it is
I did some drivin� for a man named Marcello Santos…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I quit workin� for �im, but just before I
did, I ended up one night at a house… I don�t know what it is they all
think I saw that night, but I was just sittin� out in the car till the
whole place went up in flames.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: God, Sailor… That�s the night my daddy
died.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I know, sugar… But while the place was
burnin�… Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second
floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin�… Afterwards… When I met
you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That�s some big secret you been carryin�,
Sailor.</p>

<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I didn�t want to say it … but I had a
feelin� Santos was up to somethin� with your mama…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: My mama… So Sailor, our histories have been
somewhat intertwined.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: They have, sugar.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I take that as a sign that we were destined by
fate to be together.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It�s a comfortin� idea.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Well, we�re really out in the middle of it
now, ain�t we?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: There�s worse places, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: If you say so.</p>

<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I don�t particularly care for that kind of
talk, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey… I never said you was a pussy… Always
figured you had the big ol� round balls for this kind�a thing… Sure
would set you and that pretty little girl up good.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yeah … yeah… I guess so… That kind�a money�d
get us a long way down that yellow brick road…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: …But DAMN man… This better go smooth.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Like takin� candy from a fuckin� baby…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You been drinkin�, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Few beers is all. Feelin� any better?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Can�t tell yet. Where�d you go?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That smell�s still fillin� this room
good.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: And Bobby too, I hear…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Yeah… He was lookin� for you.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You talk to �im some?…</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Some… Sparky said Red�s promised to have him
and Buddy out of here by the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Oughta make �em happy.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: So where�d you say you was?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Went with Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sail?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Let�s leave here.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We�re goin� to, Lula, real soon.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I mean tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That�d
get us to El Paso.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You shouldn�t be smokin� if you�re pregnant.
Ain�t smart.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Who says I�m smart? You up to somethin� with
Bobby Peru, Sailor?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What could I be up to, Lula?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: He�s a stone fuckin� criminal, honey, and you
ain�t.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn�t I?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That was a accident. I bet both our asses
Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That was in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: He�s the kind liked it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Lula, I got to get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old
folks, women and babies, and dumped �em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob�ly
killed the most.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Lula, he mighta did, I don�t know. But it
don�t matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain�t
their fault.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I sure enjoy smokin�, Sailor. I hate that it�s
bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: That man�s a black angel, Sailor. You hook up
with him, you�ll regret it. If you live to.</p>
<p><strong>s ailor</strong>: Thanks, darlin�, I know you got my best
interest in mind, and I �preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta
sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: This whole worlds wild at heart and weird on
top.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I wish you really, truly loved me… I wish
you�d sing me �Love Me Tender� … I wish I was somewhere over that
rainbow… Shit. Shit, shit, shit.</p>
<p><strong>bob ray</strong>: Hey Sailor… Wait a minute… I got somethin�
for ya.</p>
<p><strong>bob ray</strong>: Shit, man… Marietta says you been tryin� to
fuck her in the toilets for the past ten minutes… You crazy fuckin� bad
boy tryin� to fuck your girl�s mama… How do you think that cute little
cunt Lula would feel about that? Hey, take a look at this… Marietta just
gave me this to kill you right now, and afterward she said Lula was mine
to fuck all the way into next Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Nice of you to drop by.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Told ya I would. You still riled?</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the
ass?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ain�t never had no girl pull a blade on
me.</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Wish I�d fuckin� cut you up good.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You heard from Reggie?</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Juana called. They�re stayin� another
week.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Stayin� a few extra days in the big N.O.,
huh? This you?</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don�t look like you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The cobra�s waitin� to strike, chica.</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: That guy Sailor came around this afternoon…
Asked me if there was a contract out on �im.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No shit?!?! You know him?</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Used to.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What�d you say?</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: No, of course.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That�s right… Could have a bad accident,
though … before … durin� … or after a hold-up…</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: What�s gonna happen when he sees me drivin�
the car tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe he�ll get a little nervous, but who
gives a shit?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I knew we could be friends again…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jump in back.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What�s she doin� here?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She�s my girl… She�s drivin�… That bother
you?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Why should it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That�s right… Take one of these.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Panty hose. Work better�n stockin�s. Pull one
of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your
head. You get the pistol. Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that
bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and
the Smith, they�ll know we ain�t foolin� with �em.</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Comin� up on it now, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on! Get that mask on!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Keep it revved, Chiquita. We won�t be long.
Just goin� in to get our five grand.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Into the back room, both of you,</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If anyone comes in, herd �em back here
quick.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Waitin� for somebody, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Mi esposo. He�s in the feed store picking
up some supplies.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: You�d best be careful of that cigarette,
Ma�am. It�s about to burn down between your fingers.</p>
<p><strong>perdita</strong>: Gracias, officer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You�re next, fucker.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Oh baby, I was beginnin� to think I was
never gonna see you again.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: You�re comin� home, precious. Santos�
gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Mama, Sailor�s in deep trouble here. I just
can�t leave him.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Oh, yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>santos</strong>: Your mama�s been real worried �bout you,
honey. Me too… Can you give your old friend Santos a hug, too?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�m goin�, mama. No way I can�t go.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: You ain�t takin� Pace, though.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Course I am, mama.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: What time�s Sailor�s train get in?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Got any plans?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Figure we�ll go have supper someplace. Maybe
get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana
Brown�s Pig Pickin�.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Well, you be careful with that boy,
Lula.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Sailor ain�t a boy no more, mama.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: Don�t mean him. It�s Pace concerns me.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Really, mama, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: What if I asked you not to?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Wouldn�t make any difference.</p>
<p><strong>marietta</strong>: What if I told you not to?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Mama … if you get in the way of me and
Sailor�s happiness, I�ll fuckin� pull your arms out by the roots.</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: How�ll we know what he looks like?</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: Mama, you almost crashed us.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Don�t give me no trouble now, Pace, please.
This ain�t the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are
we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: How�ll he know what we look like? He seen our
photo?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Damn it, child! Now look what you made me
do.</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: What I made you do, mama?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Nothin�, honey. Mama�s just actin�
strange.</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: You ain�t actin�, mama.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain�t you got one
cute mouth tonight?</p>
<p><strong>wheelchair man</strong>: Hey man… HEY… Same fuckin� thing
happened to me last year…</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: I still ain�t sure what my daddy looks
like.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got
the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair
is like mine.</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: My daddy ain�t never killed nobody, has he,
mama?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Course he ain�t never killed nobody. Why�d you
say that, Pace?</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama
talkin�.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no
murder. Musta been you didn�t hear grandmama proper. He made some
mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain�t always been so lucky… We�re almost at
the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: Why we sittin� here, mama?</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Thinkin� a second, baby.</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: I�m scared, mama.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Why, honey?</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: Case daddy don�t like me. What if he don�t
like that I don�t got his color hair.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Pace, your daddy�d love you even if you didn�t
have no hair at all.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Still partial to Camels, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: First pack of tailor-mades I had in a
while.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You must be my son.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Shake hands with your daddy.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Pleasure to meet you, Pace. I read a lot
about you.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: You hungry? Pace and I ain�t had dinner
yet.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Lead the way.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: No rag top, huh?</p>
<p><strong>pace</strong>: What�s wrong, mama?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Don�t worry, son. Just stay here.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: I�m sorry, Sailor. I just can�t help it. Give
me a minute and I�ll quit.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Boys frightened, Lula. This ain�t no
good.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Really, Sail, I�ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It�s a mistake, honey. You two go on. I�ll
walk back to the depot.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: What�re you talkin� about? That�s your son in
there.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: He ain�t never known me, Lula, so there
ain�t much for him to forget. Not seein� each other for six years makes
it next best to simple for us, too.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: How can you say that, Sailor?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What makes sense, is all.</p>
<p><strong>lula</strong>: Don�t do this, Sailor, please.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Oiga, amigo. If ever somethin� don�t feel
right to you, remember what Pancho said to The Cisco Kid… �Let�s went,
before we are dancing at the end of a rope, without music.�</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: You been doin� fine without me, peanut.
There ain�t no need to make life tougher�n it has to be.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: What do you faggots want?</p>
<p><strong>good witch</strong>: Sailor Ripley…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: The Good Witch…</p>
<p><strong>good witch</strong>: Sailor… Lula loves you.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: But I�m a robber and a manslaughterer and I
haven�t had any parental guidance.</p>
<p><strong>good witch</strong>: She�s forgiven you of all these things …
You love her… Don�t be afraid, Sailor.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: But I�m wild at heart.</p>
<p><strong>good witch</strong>: If you are truly wild at heart, you�ll
fight for your dreams… Don�t turn away from love, Sailor… Don�t turn
away from love… Don�t turn away from love.</p>
<p><strong>gang member</strong>: You had enough, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Yes, I have… And I wanna apologize to you
gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals. I also want to thank you
fellas, you�ve taught me a valuable lesson in life.</p>
