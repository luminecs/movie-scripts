<h1 id="cobb">cobb</h1>
<p><strong>close on pipe in ashtray</strong>: Smoke curls. A man’s hand
picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>close on man’s hat and coat</strong>: on a coat rack.</p>
<p><strong>close on waste basket</strong>: Overflowing with crunched-up
paper.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: lies on a couch near the window. He stands up
suddenly and looks out the window. AL STUMP, 40, is sharply dressed –
tie, dress shirt, cufflinks. He’s staring at something.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The muse has not descended, Lucille. The muse
has not descended. God damn it, Lucille, you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: The muse has not descended.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yes! The muse has left me stranded here like
a beached whale – only one phrase, one word, from finishing the greatest
essay I’ve ever written! One word, the right word – Flaubert called it
‘le mot juste’ – I ever tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: ‘Le mot juste’ – the exact right word the
writer needs to tell his story. Yessir, you’ve mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce – they all
searched for ‘le mot juste’ until they cried, until they bled…</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What is this essay about again?</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Fishing.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I mean what is it really about?</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: You said it was about the quote unquote
primal issues of survival, man against nature, etcetera – that’s what
you said.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ohyeah… so… we end the essay with…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: ‘The tarpon leaps shimmering into the late
cross light of the keys, a primeval moment frozen in… … frozen in’…</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Shimmering tarpon – very good, Mr. Stump… …
‘frozen in’ what?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I don’t know, Lucille, that’s what the Muse
will tell me if she ever descends. … ‘frozen in’…</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Yes? Yes? Just a minute, I’ll see if he’s
available. It’s your wife – are you and she speaking again?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I dunno. How does she sound?</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Don’t ask me to interpret.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Tell her… tell her… I’ll talk… no… tell her
I’m out – I’ll call her later… God damn it.</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Apparently he’s out, Mrs. Stump – I’ll have
him call you back.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: What about ‘le mot juste,’ Mr. Stump?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fuck ‘le mot juste,’ Lucille! Finish the damn
thing yourself. ‘The primeval moment is frozen in’ whatever the hell you
want it to be. Did you know that James Joyce let his secretary – none
other than Samuel Beckett – revise and edit Molly’s solliloquy in
Ulysses? You’re my Beckett – I give you ‘le mot juste!’ Just get the
damn thing in the mail so I can get paid.</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Problems with the Mrs.?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I don’t know. I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext. downtown street - late afternoon 2</strong>: Stump
pogo sticks down the sidewalk, tipping his hat to pedestrians. They’re
not alarmed. He’s the town eccentric. He pogos across a street and
towards –</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. the sportsman’s lounge - late afternoon 3</strong>: A
watering hole like a million others. He pogo sticks right in the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, Stumpy…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Awright, awright… how do you get five old
ladies to say ‘fuck?’</p>
<p><strong>cronies</strong>: Jeez, I dunno, how? Etc…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yell ‘bingo.’</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: Okay, I got one – A drunk is taking a piss
in front of a bar, a bus drives by, real fast right along the curb, and
knocks his thing off. Drunk picks up his thing, puts it in his pocket,
goes into a bar, reaches into his pocket and puts his thing on the bar.
‘Look’t that,’ he says, ‘bus knocked my thing off.’ Bartender says,
‘that ain’t your thing – that’s a cigar butt.’</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: Drunk reaches into his other pocket and
slaps another thing on the bar. ‘There,’ he says, ‘bus knocked my thing
off.’ Bartender says, ‘you’re drunk and that ain’t your thing either.
That’s another cigar butt.’ Drunk looks down at both cigar butts and
back up at the bartender and says, ‘God damn it, I mushta smoked my
dick.’</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Amidst this levity, gentlemen, I have some
real concerns. Mark my words, people will look back on this year and say
that 1960 was the year that Western Civilization began its downward
trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You need to get laid, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Guys, guys, c’mon… do you really think things
are as good as they used to be? You think Jack Kennedy is qualified to
be President?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Kennedy may not be qualified, but – Jackie’s a
babe – and that’s good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: They’re a happily married couple and that
oughta stand for something these days…</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: Speaking of being happily married, Al, are you
and your old lady still having problems?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Oh no, the wife and I are all patched up –
doin’ fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>cronies</strong>: Good to hear… awright… way to go,
Stumpy…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean look at us – we call ourselves writers
but we just watch ballgames and get drunk a lot. You call that
writing?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: In the department store of life, sports is the
toy department – so what?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, besides, Alan here’s writing a serious
novel, aren’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: Yeah, well I haven’t started yet but I’m gonna.
I’ve been busy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You guys are pathetic. Ya write for one
reason – a paycheck.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: More art was created for money than for
passion. Take your platitudes and shove ’em, Frank. I’m gonna write a
novel too, someday.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The Great American Novel, I suppose?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It could come from my pen.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re a barbershop writer, Al – you write
sugar-coated pieces for guys to skim when they’re waiting for a
haircut!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Awright, that’s it! Let’s go! Settle this
right here!</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: Stump! For you.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Phone call saved your ass.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yeah… yeah… who?… no… you’re kidding?…
when?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Hey… Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Cobb wants to see me.</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: Cobb who?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty Cobb! How many Cobbs are there?!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ty Cobb? I thought he was dead?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Not yet. He said he wants to tell me the real
story of his life before he croaks.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You were just talking to Ty Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The Georgia Peach himself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They say Cobb is crazy. The meanest
sonofabitch who ever lived.</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: I heard he killed a man.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe so, but – he was the greatest baseball
player of them all.</p>
<p><strong>cronies</strong>: Yeah, the best, no one close, etc…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen, Al, be careful –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I ain’t gettin’ my ass shot, don’t worry…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, not that – the story. This is like Ivan
the Terrible inviting somebody into the Czar’s palace before he
died.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Except Ivan was a nicer guy…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t let Cobb bullshit you. This is your
shot. This is all our shot. When does he want to see you?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Immediately.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I gathered all the film footage that existed
on Cobb – which wasn’t much – and rented the local theater for the
afternoon… I, too, had thought that the great Ty Cobb had been dead for
awhile…</p>
<p><strong>6 angle on screen 6</strong>: The screen fills with Movietone
Newsreel footage of Ty Cobb, complete with overly sincere NARRATION and
MUSIC.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel narrator</strong>: This 1905 cameo of an 18-year-old
youth shows a peaches-and-cream complexion and the piercing eyes of a
lad who would become, etc…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: His reputation as being difficult at best,
psychotic at worst, preceded him. But if there was one thing I knew
after all my years as a journalist covering politicians, celebrities,
and sports heroes, it was this –</p>
<p><strong>6 continued: 6</strong>: Onscreen – Cobb with children, Cobb
with celebri- ties, Cobb in a parade honoring him, and always, Cobb’s
dashing, swashbuckling style of play.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The ‘facts’ – and public perception of those
‘facts’ – frequently bear little resemblance.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: One thing was beyond argument – he was the
most brilliant athlete of his time… perhaps of any time. I was
determined to find out who was the real Ty Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>7 ext. mother lode country - late afternoon 7</strong>:
Stump’s car, a late model Buick, moves across the stunning grasslands at
the western base of the Sierra Nevadas. We begin hearing his voice, then
see him inside the car driving.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: They said Cobb owned property all over the
country, but in recent years had been staying in his hunting lodge at
Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevadas.</p>
<p><strong>10 int. car - dusk 10</strong>: Stump straining to see the
road, a bit wary of this drive.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Driving into the Sierras at night with winter
coming on wasn’t the smartest decision I’d ever made but it seemed
better than being late for my first meeting with Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>pov shot through windshield</strong>: A dismal, wet and
obscured view of the mountain road, climbing higher into the Sierras. A
small roadside gas station comes INTO VIEW, and – Stump pulls his car
into the station.</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. jonah’s service station - dusk 11</strong>: Stump
gets out, blows on his hands. It’s cold, and a man comes out, the gas
station owner, JONAH, 55. The man services the car throughout the
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fill it up and replace the wiper blades.</p>
<p><strong>jonah</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Colder than a witch’s tit, eh?</p>
<p><strong>jonah</strong>: It’s just starting. We got three- four feet
of snow another thousand feet up. Where ya going? Skiing? I hate
skiing.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Actually, I’m going to meet Ty Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>jonah</strong>: Cobb?! He stopped here for gas once, I asked
him for an autograph for my boy and he told me to shove it where the sun
don’t shine.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I hear he’s got a way with kids…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Hey, baby, it’s me… Al… your husband… I’m up
in the woods somewhere on assignment… Listen, sweetheart, listen –
nobody can love you the way I love you and I want you to take me back. I
made a mistake. Okay, lots of mistakes. I know I’m not worthy.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Honey? Sweetheart? Baby?</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. mountain road - night 12</strong>: RAIN POUNDS down
as the car climbs to higher elevation.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. car - night 13</strong>: Stump struggles with a map
under the dome light as he drives.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I confess I was looking forward to seeing
Cobb and being near his brilliance. My own life seemed on hold, somehow.
Everyday churning out the same old articles, drinking at 4 in the
afternoon with the same old guys, the same old excuses for not writing a
novel, the same old confused marriages that we all needed and were
trying to get out of at the same time… Cobb was a god whose brilliance,
however difficult, could rub off on me. His problems were different than
mine…</p>
<p><strong>14 angle on stump’s car 14</strong>: which pulls off the road
and heads up a small mountain road among snow-covered pines.</p>
<p><strong>close on stump</strong>: He smiles. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: His car heads up a mountain road a
final hundred yards, comes around a bend in the trees and there it is
–</p>
<p><strong>14 pov shot - huge mountain lodge 14</strong>: In the grand
style but, like the mailbox, grotesquely oversized.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Fuck you, Mr. Cobb, I have too much dignity
to spend another moment with you. I hope you die before the sun comes up
and may you rot in hell!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m a writer.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You mean he actually found somebody to take
the job?</p>
<p><strong>16 int. mountain lodge - night 16</strong>: Stump in the
front door – The place is enormous and barely lit. Taxidermied game
hangs on the wall. Stump is terrified. A MAN is sitting in an
overstuffed chair reading a news- paper. Dressed in a business suit and
tie, he seems oblivious to the surrounding chaos. He also seems out of
place.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Mr. Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Mr. Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>17 angle on stairs 17</strong>: Stump climbs the stairs with
caution – Until he’s just outside the half open door from which light
spills. He hesitates…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Hello? Mr. Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb, but I don’t
need this job that bad.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yes, Mr. Stump – you do need this job that
bad.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now come in here and meet the great Ty Cobb. I
won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>18 pov shot - ty cobb 18</strong>: Lying in bed in a robe.
Unshaven. Bottles of booze and food everywhere. And bottles of pills sit
on every surface. Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him. A small
record player sits next to he bed. A record spins, filling the room with
FRITZ KREISLER VIOLIN SOLOS. He places the gun on his night table,
knocking pills and bottles to the floor with a crash he barely notices.
When he speaks it is without a snarl, without threat – simply, even
sweetly, he says:</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: On the violin – Fritz Kreisler. I’m a great
admirer of his. I’m also a great admirer of yours.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: But you are a hopeless romantic and only a
moderate success.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Sir, I am the most successful sportswriter in
America and not merely a ‘moderate success.’</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Of course. Give me those pills over there.</p>
<p><strong>18 continued: 18</strong>: Stump retrieves some pills that
Cobb is pointing towards. Cobb washes down a handful of pills with a
bottle of Scotch. Momentarily revitalized, Cobb hands Stump a folded
letter which Stump opens to read.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s an invitation to a testimonial dinner
at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. You’re taking me
there – when is it?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: A few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: All the great ones will be there – The great
Mickey Cochrane will be there! Hornsby, Sisler, Ott, the Waner Brothers…
we used to have some parties, Stump, I’ll tell ya that right now… We
can’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I won’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Look at me closely, Al… Lie after lie has been
written about me – my whole life I’ve been misunderstood. You’re gonna
tell the real story of Ty Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What’s the ‘real’ story?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s why you’re here. See, there’s two kinds
of writers. The kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects…
that’s you.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Or… there’s the kind with one great subject
that consumes them forever. That could be you. Because I am that
subject.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Jameson! Get your ass up here!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Mmmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>20 close on cobb’s face 20</strong>: His eyes light. A flare
in his nostrils. A twitch. And utter calm.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There’s a small oil company near Bakersfield
called Honolulu Oil, sitting near the Elk Hills Reserve… I want you to
buy all the stock you can.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Honolulu Oil?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Getty is expanding in the west, looking for
companies like that. I got a hunch… Stumpy, c’mere…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I can take that buck. What’ya think?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: With a pistol? No way.</p>
<p><strong>21 pov shot - buck in moonlight 21</strong>: searches for
leaves to eat in the snow. Serene. Unaware.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There’s a board meeting of Coca-Cola in
Georgia next week. Call them up and tell them I can’t make it for
medical – – personal – reasons… … and sell all the 3-M stock we got.</p>
<p><strong>22 cobb 22</strong>: raises the gun – he wobbles badly and
steadies himself. The gun shakes. Then steadies.</p>
<p><strong>23 pov shot - buck raises its head 23</strong>: Just as…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Got him.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Like hell you did.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Right behind the ear.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Jameson?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: If Mr. Cobb said he got him, then he got
him.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You have no vision, Stump. A writer without
vision is a waste of my time. I think I picked the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: And I think I better get back to San
Francisco before the storm hits. I’ll take care of these transactions,
Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: And I’ll be leaving as well, sir, since you
think I’m the wrong man for the job.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shut up, Stump – we both know that I’m your
meal ticket. We need each other. And we start in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>25 ext. mountain lodge - early next a.m. 25</strong>:
Silence.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ready, Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Chapter one, Page one…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: ‘Know ye that a prince and a great man has
fallen this day.’</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s what Robert E. Lee said at the burial
of my grandfather who was a Confederate General killed at
Fredricksburg.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: So I’m taking notes?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hell no. That’s the first line of my
autobiography.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I ain’t writing it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It’s horseshit. It’s a third person comment
about someone who’s already dead. An autobiography has to be in the
first person – plus it can’t come from the other side of the God damn
grave.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My story can come from any damn place I
want.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Not to mention you can’t call yourself ‘a
prince and great man’ – that’s for the world to decide.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What kind of a fucking writer you call
yourself – all tied up in rules and regulations. What’s the point being
a writer if you can’t say what you want to?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You’re not treating me like a writer – you’re
treating me like a stenographer.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Know ye that a prince and a great man has
fallen this day…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It has a certain ring to it…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yes it does.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I thought you might like it. It’s yours, a
gift from me. ‘Cobb, a prince among men, misunderstood in his genius, as
genius always is’ - This is the second line from what will be the
greatest biography of a great man ever written – type it!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Bethlehem Steel’s about to dive.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Jameson. Bethlehem’s going in the toilet. Dump
it all!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You got a stock tip for me?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yeah… buy Coca-Cola. We’re about to go out in
cans.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Coke in cans? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You know what’s wrong with Ty Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Every disease known to man – I got ‘em all!
And they’ll never get me in a hospital – never! My heart leaks – the
doctors who are nothin’ but a buncha hacksaw artists give me Digoxin to
keep it pumping…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: They give me Darvon for the cancer in my back,
they give me Tace for something eatin’ up my stomach, Fleets Compound
for an infection in my bowels, Librium for my tension, insulin for my
diabetes…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Fuckin’ insulin…</p>
<p><strong>26 continued: 26</strong>: He takes a deep breath as if the
drug has produced an immediate relief from pain.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And if all that wasn’t enough, it’s been two
years since I got my pecker in the air… The South may not rise again but
my dick will.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I ain’t here!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Cobb’s residence… hello. He’s not here –
who’s calling? Ernie? Ernie who? My God… It’s Ernest Hemingway… for
you.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Tell him to go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Jesus Christ, Ty, this is the great American
writer – this is the man who inspired me to become a writer!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Tell him to go to hell anyway.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Him and me used to be pals but we went on a
hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: That’s it? You didn’t like a guide he
hired?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You tell him to go fuck himself or I’ll kick
your Yankee ass!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Mr. Hemingway? Mr. Cobb says… to go to hell.
By the way I’m a big fan of yours –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hemingway isn’t a bullfighter – he wrote about
bullfighting. What the hell is that?! Bullshit… Damn painkillers…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’ll pass… Stumpy, listen to me – you know
what I need?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I need a woman. A woman is definitely what I
need…</p>
<p><strong>26 continued: 26</strong>: And Cobb drifts to sleep in his
chair, momentarily overcome with painkillers.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I couldn’t be around the man for long without
needing a break, which his painkillers gracefully provided. My sanity
would soon depend upon a frequent breath of fresh air, a walk in the
woods – any escape from what one sportswriter had called ‘Cobb’s
brooding soul that bubbled with violence.’</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I knew most of the Cobb stories – first man
elected to the Hall of Fame, ahead of the incomparable Babe Ruth.
Statistics that haven’t been approached in three-quarters of a
century.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: But I’d known boxing champions and football
players – they were gentle souls outside the arena. How much of Cobb was
an act, a lifetime of theatrical intimidation to preserve his own
legend?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Legends grow in time. Tough guys are tougher,
women more beautiful, routine acts of self-preservation become
heroic.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>28 int. lodge - night 28</strong>: Stump bursts into the
lodge as the brewing storm blows in. Cobb is standing there in a hunting
jacket, high laced boots, a hat, with a suitcase. He holds a paper bag
wrapped in twine.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: We’re going to Reno. I want a woman.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: There’s a blizzard out there!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: When a man wants a woman, a man wants a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Let’s just put on some soup, build a fire,
and we can work on the book.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: How cozy. I got 25 thousand in cash and
negotiable securities in here. Don’t let it out of your sight.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Look, Ty, the roads are impassable.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You lead, I’ll follow.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m not driving in this stuff!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I need a woman!</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. two lane highway in sierras - dusk 29</strong>: A
blizzard – two cars ease down an ice-covered road in an increasingly
horrendous snowstorm.</p>
<p><strong>30 int. stump’s car - dusk 30</strong>: Stump is terrified,
straining to see through the flurries which grow thicker by the second.
He keeps checking his rearview mirror.</p>
<p><strong>pov shot through rearview mirror</strong>: Cobb at the wheel
of a huge, black, Chrysler Imperial. He looks possessed.</p>
<p><strong>31 int. cobb’s car - dusk 31</strong>: Cobb at the wheel – A
madman.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You call that driving, Alice?! My sister can
drive faster than that! Step on it!</p>
<p><strong>31 continued: 31</strong>: He grabs a bottle of bourbon on
the seat and chugs it down.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Get off the road – ya can’t drive any faster?!
Move it!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fuck you! I ain’t dying in this God damn ice
cube!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: The man drives like an old woman…</p>
<p><strong>36 stump’s pov 36</strong>: Cobb waves his fist as he speeds
past –</p>
<p><strong>37 close on cobb 37</strong>: He laughs, cackling madly at
Stump.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Drive, motherfucker, drive!</p>
<p><strong>38 stump’s pov 38</strong>: The black Chrysler rushes down
the mountain into the raging storm.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: struggles to see through the windshield –
snow is swirling everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>stump’s pov</strong>: Cobb’s car disappears into the
blizzard, fishtailing as it goes.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He’s a goner, Al, save your own God damn
ass…</p>
<p><strong>42 another angle 42</strong>: Stump stops his car and gets
out – He hurries to the edge of the road where the bank drops away
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>pov shot - cobb’s car</strong>: lies nose down at the bottom
of a snow-filled ravine, thirty feet away. The tail lights are still on.
The car is totalled.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Cobb!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’s about fucking time you got here!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You’ve alive?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I wouldn’t call it living but it’ll do. Help
me outta here.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: There’s blood!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Of course there’s blood! I just put my head
through the windshield of a car, what the hell ya think, ya big fucking
jerk.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Ty Cobb can’t die like this! They’ll bury me
and nobody’ll know who it is!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I said shut up.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Look’t that! No guard rail! I’m suing the
State Highway Commission, I’m suing the Governor, I’m suing every God
damn body! I coulda been killed!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: God damn it, shut up and get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Gimme your keys, I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Do you know how to get to Reno? Hell, no! I’m
driving.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Over my dead body!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Your call.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You miserable son of a bitch. You coward, you
pathetic, frightened, desperate old man – you can’t do anything without
that gun and frankly it doesn’t impress me to keep flashing it because I
know you’re not gonna shoot me ’cause you need me worse than I need you.
What, you’re gonna kill me?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’ve killed a man.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fine, then put me outta my fuckin’ misery.
I’m freezing.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Here ya go, Stumpy. I like a man who stands up
to me.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now give me the keys. I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. car in blizzard - night 44</strong>: Cobb at the
wheel is perfectly happy and at peace. Stump, in the passenger’s seat,
braces himself for certain death.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’s only another hour – plenty of time to
tell you my story before we find us some women.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Women? Plural?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Some for you, some for me. We’ll have a
helluva time. The broads’re probably lining up right now, waiting for
ol’ Ty and his buddy Stump.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Dear God…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I suppose you want to know about my childhood.
Writers usually do.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: None of this ‘know ye that a prince and great
man has fallen’ stuff –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My philosophy is simply this – Life is too
short to be diplomatic. A man’s friends shouldn’t mind what he does or
says, and those who are not his friends, well, to hell with ’em.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I was born in a small town in Georgia, of
course… my sweet sister Florence still lives there…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And I started playing baseball when I was a
kid like everybody else only I was better than every- body else. When I
was seventeen I started playing for money – my father didn’t approve. He
was a great man…</p>
<p><strong>45 ext. highway 45</strong>: As the snow whirls around the
car hurtling down the mountain, the snowflakes FILL the SCREEN and turn
to confetti as we:</p>
<p><strong>46 ext. royston - day 46</strong>: Confetti falls from the
sky – PROFESSOR COBB, 40, Ty’s father, waves to the crowd in front of
city hall. Signs everywhere declare him to be the newly elected MAYOR
COBB. A band plays “Sweet Georgia Brown” as the Mayor makes a victory
speech.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: He was the mayor, they were grooming him for
governor, he was a learned man, a professor, and the Head Deacon in the
Baptist Church.</p>
<p><strong>47 int. baptist church - day 47</strong>: Professor Cobb
sings loudly with the Deacons behind the Pastor as the CONGREGATION
joins in.</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: ‘There is a fountain filled with Drawn
from Emmanuel’s veins…’</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My mother was the most beautiful woman in the
county… she married my father when she was twelve which was the way they
used to do it. And she taught me to believe in the hymns we sang… I
especially liked the bloody ones… ‘And sinners plunged beneath that Lose
all their guilty stains…’</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. river in georgia - day 48</strong>: Young Ty Cobb is
baptized in the river.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I remember after I was baptized and I was
walking home with my pals…</p>
<p><strong>49 ext. train track in rural georgia - day 49</strong>: Young
Ty and three buddies walk along the track.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I was feeling very Christian, ready to live
the good life – my father didn’t drink, smoke, gamble or chase women –
and I wasn’t going to either –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: … when all of a sudden a train was coming at
us.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There I was, a newly baptized child of God who
hadn’t hardly sinned, and I was gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: The engine bore down on me till I could see
the whites of the engineer’s eyes – I was thrilled…</p>
<p><strong>close on young cobb</strong>: His face filled with excitement
as the space between him and the engine reduces to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Closer and closer the engine comes – 50
yards, 25 yards, 10, five, four, three… moments before death – Young Ty
Cobb leaps to safety, flying in front of the engine, out over the water
till he splashes, mere milli- seconds before he would have been crushed
to death.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: … it was the greatest thrill in my life not
counting the first time I saw a woman naked…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I felt protected. By my father, my mother, the
baptism, I don’t know – but from that moment on I knew I couldn’t be
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>series of shots</strong>: Young Cobb hurtles through the air
toward the river, just missing the locomotive…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father died in a terrible accident, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No, I didn’t, really…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Didn’t you do your research on me before you
came up here?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I didn’t have time… I mean, I knew the
basics.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Then you’ve read that I’m the meanest bastard
of them all?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: People have said that, yes…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I don’t care what people think.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Then why do you care what I write?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I am who I tell you I am! Why are you making
things so complicated?!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: That’s what writers do.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well writers oughta make things simple!
Everything’s complicated enough as it is.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Maybe you’re right!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Of course I’m right!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Godddddddd!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Don’t shout like that, Stumpy – it just
increases my tension. I saw that truck all along – you think I’m gonna
hit a truck when I’m getting close to finding me some women?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father was murdered, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Your father was murdered?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I mean that’s the sort of thing you’re looking
for, isn’t it? Murdered on the balcony of his own house… the house I
grew up in…</p>
<p><strong>52 ext. gabled house in georgia - night 52</strong>: The head
of a horse in f.g., shaking its head, uncomfort- able with the bit in
its mouth. In the b.g., the gabled house in the moonlight. A small light
spills from a second- floor window onto the balcony. A man on the
balcony porch moves toward the window from which light spills.</p>
<p><strong>53 int. car on highway - dusk 53</strong>: Stump is stunned
by this information as the car careens wildly down the mountainside.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Your father was murdered? How come nobody
knows about this?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: The oldtimers in Royston know about it. Nobody
else’s business. It happened when I was 17, a few days before Detroit
called me up.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: But this helps explain why –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Why I’m such a prick? Ha! That’s too easy –
you’re a better writer than that –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Was the killer ever caught?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There was an arrest, a trial, and an
acquittal. Nobody was ever convicted.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Jesus Christ –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Aw, don’t go sob-sister on me, Stumpy. The
only thing that finally matters is a man’s accomplishments and I must
say, in all humility, Al, in all humility – I was the greatest
ballplayer of all time. Nobody is even a close second.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Single to left, steal second, steal third,
steal home…</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Eight to one.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Ten to one.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re on.</p>
<p><strong>55 ext. on-deck circle - day 55</strong>: Cobb swings the bat
and shouts at the pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hey, greaseball, check your wife – one of the
players is missing!</p>
<p><strong>55 continued: 55</strong>: The pitcher flips Cobb the finger
and takes a sign, deliv- ering a pitch which is swung on and missed,
strike three.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Who the hell ever signed you?</p>
<p><strong>teammate</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hey, Cyclops, you’re missing a good game.</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Shut up, Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Here ya go…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Your old lady left ’em in my car last night –
I thought you could give ’em back to her.</p>
<p><strong>catcher</strong>: You’re going down, Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s as hard as you can throw?! Shit, it
that was my fastball I’d wear a dress!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hey, Wagner! I’d shade me a little up the
middle if I was you!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You try to take my head off then you throw a
sinker away, in and out, same old shit – sinker away…</p>
<p><strong>close on cobb</strong>: His chatter stops, his focus is
intense and sudden. He holds the bat strangely, with a split grip, a
left- handed batter, he dangles the bat almost parallel to the ground.
For all his fierceness, there’s a delicacy in the way he holds the bat.
A baton, a paintbrush, a magic wand…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You God damn coward! You shoulda thrown at me
again! You shoulda hit me in the fucking head!</p>
<p><strong>55 continued: 55</strong>: Cobb looks down at Wagner who
stands implacably at short- stop, a large, powerfully-built man.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hey, Krauthead, I’m coming down.</p>
<p><strong>close on wagner</strong>: He just nods.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: The pitcher stretches, looks and delivers
– and Cobb breaks for second. The pitch is wide. The Catcher fires.</p>
<p><strong>back in dugout</strong>: More money is wagered.</p>
<p><strong>pitcher</strong>: Stretches and delivers – Cobb takes off for
third. The throw is high – he slides in safely.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You want in on the action? My mother has a
better arm than you! I’m coming to you, greaseball! Coming to kick your
dago ass!</p>
<p><strong>catcher</strong>: steals a glance at Cobb who takes a
menacing lead off third. The Catcher gives a signal to the pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: In those days you didn’t hold hands and dance
with the men on the other teams. They were the enemy – you fought with
’em. And I was the most hated man in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>fan #1</strong>: You’re a shit, Cobb!</p>
<p><strong>56 continued: 56</strong>: Cobb continues warming up.</p>
<p><strong>fan #2</strong>: I hate your guts, Cobb!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: A good day to you, too, sir…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Do you know what it’s like to be booed like
that?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It feels wonderful! They couldn’t live without
me! They came to the ballpark to see me!</p>
<p><strong>close on mail</strong>: Cut-out letters read: “COBB - YOU’RE
DEAD”</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Fifty thousand fans trying to kill me
everywhere I went!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I loved it. Only great men are booed. Captains
of industry and presidents. I knew ’em all…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Woodrow Wilson had the best Scotch…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Warren Harding had the best broads…</p>
<p><strong>61 int. white house study 61</strong>: A formal portrait with
President Calvin Coolidge and Cobb. Coolidge doesn’t smile, doesn’t seem
to do any- thing. Just another portrait.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And Calvin Coolidge wasn’t any damn fun at
all…</p>
<p><strong>62 int. car careening down mountainside - dusk 62</strong>:
Like an out of control bobsled – Cobb races and Stump hangs on for his
life.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: After World War Two, General Patton asked me
for an autograph – he said he patterned himself after me! Are you
getting this?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’ll remember.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Why aren’t you writing?!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: ’Cause I’m trying to have a good grip on
things when this car goes over the next cliff! I ain’t ready to die
yet!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: But neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I said I’m not ready to die.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Then watch the fucking road.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: But you’re not listening to me! I may have
every God damn disease known to man but I am never going to check into a
hospital because I am alive and I am going to get laid in Reno!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re gonna get laid, too, Stumpy!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Maybe I don’t wanta get laid!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You queer?!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m married.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I thought you were divorced.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: We’re in the middle of a… problem. We’re
talking.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Talking my ass! Quit hanging on – get a
divorce. Is that why you don’t wanta get laid in Reno? ’Cause you’re
feeling loyal to a woman you’re divorcing? That’s really stupid,
Stumpy…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m not getting a divorce. I’m being
loyal.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Is that why you used to wine and dine that
little brunette who had an office across the courtyard from you in Santa
Barbara?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What do you know about her?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I do my homework, Stumpy. I know where the
bodies are buried.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It didn’t last long!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hey, no need to defend yourself. When it comes
to women I’m a total shit – the difference is, Stumpy, that I know I’m a
shit.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Nobody knows about the brunette.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Our little secret, huh? And that part about me
being a shit with women? That ain’t gonna be in the book.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I gotta put your family in my book.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Your book?! My book! And nothing about my
ex-wives or children are gonna be in it. My book is about baseball!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: My book is about Cobb!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Cobb is baseball!</p>
<p><strong>63 ext. highway 63</strong>: Suddenly something appears ahead
on the roadside. Cobb doesn’t see it. Stump does. It looks like a
figure, huddled, wrapped, immobile in the swirling snow. It can’t
be…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty! Look! It’s a man!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Fuck him…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Stop the car!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Whoever it is he’s gotta be pretty stupid to
be out in this shit.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: We’re out in this shit!</p>
<p><strong>64 ext. side of road - dusk 64</strong>: Stump trudges back
to the half-frozen figure who flails his arms stiffly at the apparition
of a car in all this. The figure is wrapped in blankets, his head
covered. We cannot see who it is until we are in his face.</p>
<p><strong>figure in snow</strong>: Help me. Please help me.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: My God… it’s you. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I can’t believe you found me…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Let me help you to the car.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I told you that you’d only last one day with
the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Cobb’s in the car. He’s driving.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Mr. Cobb’s in the car?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Then I’m not getting in the car with that
son of a bitch. I’d rather take my chances out here.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He hates me. He hates black people…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He fucking hates everybody. Don’t give him
the pleasure of dying out here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: If dying out here gives him pleasure then I
won’t die out here.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty, it’s Willie. We can give him a lift to
town.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Bullshit! I ain’t givin’ no nigger a ride
nowhere!</p>
<p><strong>65 int. stump’s car - dusk 65</strong>: And Stump loses it –
he grabs Cobb’s pistol off the seat of the car and aims it right at
Cobb’s head.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Shut the fuck up and give him a ride!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now who’s the coward! You won’t shoot me! You
need me!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No. But I’m sure Willie would take great
pleasure in it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’ll pay for this, Stumpy…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Say, Willie, you a baseball fan?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yessir…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Who’s the greatest ballplayer of all time, in
your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Willie Mays, no doubt about it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That nigger couldn’t hold my jock!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Cobb, the man is speaking…</p>
<p><strong>66 new angle 66</strong>: And Cobb jumps on the gas – the car
races off, back down the mountain, fishtailing as it goes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: And I’d say the second greatest player of
all time is Jackie Robinson… or maybe Josh Gibson…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shut up!!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: And of course, the greatest base runner of
all time isn’t riding in this car – the fastest baseball player of all
time was Cool Papa Bell – Cool Papa would’ve easily broke all your
stolen base records –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Cool Papa was so fast that when he entered a
hotel room and flipped the light switch off, he’d be asleep in bed
before it got dark…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: And then there’s Satchel Paige…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh yeah, Satchel Paige could throw a
porkchop past a wolf, Mr. Cobb, ol’ Satchel woulda had you eatin’ outta
his hand, he woulda had you hittin’ .220 and kissin’ his black ass to
boot…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shut this man up!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: The man with the gun does the talking, you
wretched, old prick…</p>
<p><strong>67 long shot - car 67</strong>: racing down the highway in
the snow, and we go out hearing Willie recount the greatest ballplayers
of all time – all of them black – as Cobb seethes, a gun to his head.
Stump feeds Willie, watching Cobb’s racism simmer.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ice! Slow down! Tyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>70 close on three men 70</strong>: The world spins around
them as they cling for their lives. Until: THUD – the car slams into a
bank of snow. Suddenly, silence.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Fucked up roads. They don’t build highways
like they used to.</p>
<p><strong>71 pov - hotel sign in distance 71</strong>: glows a welcome
sign in the night. It is no longer snowing.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, Mr. Cobb, thank you for a lift into
town…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: And you, sir, should leave this disgusting,
wretched, sorry son of a bitch immediately. Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. last chance hotel - night 73</strong>: Stump helps
Cobb to the registration desk in a clean, but very modest old hotel. A
WOMAN, 30s, stands at the counter in the middle of some dispute with the
clerk. She wears a long, cheap, plain- cloth overcoat and galoshes.
Stump bursts in, oblivious to the conversation in progress.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Two rooms, please…</p>
<p><strong>woman in wig</strong>: Stand back, you old farts. I’m in the
middle of something – The heat’s on the blink and the mattress is lumpy
– I want a discount.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Aw, c’mon, you always want a discount,
Mona.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Ra-mona… and the mattress is always lumpy
–</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Excuse me, I’ve gotta get him checked in.
He’s very sick.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: We’re all sick in the eyes of God – but some
of us still have manners.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Two rooms, next to each other.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. cobb’s room - night 74</strong>: Stump helps Cobb
shoot up with insulin – The needle clumsily groping for a vein in the
old man’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My money…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Your money’s okay, Ty, right here…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My gun…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Your gun’s okay, too… right here…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: We haven’t missed the testimonial dinner, have
we?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No we haven’t missed the dinner…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Good, good…</p>
<p><strong>75 int. stump’s room next door - night 75</strong>: Stump
pours a glass of vodka, settles into a chair, and dials the phone. He
swallows deeply of the drink, and waits.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Hello? Happy Birthday! It’s your Daddy! Yeah!
Your birthday was yesterday?! No, it couldn’t be!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Omigod, what can I say? I feel terrible – no,
it’s not okay, jeez… When I get off the road we’ll do something special
– a late birthday, eh? Maybe you can go to spring training or something
with me, eh? Yeah… Listen, is your mother there? I know she doesn’t want
to speak to me, but I want to speak to her. Okay, okay – I feel terrible
about the birthday… I’ll call you real soon. And tell your mother I’m
not drinking anymore. Okay… ’bye, ’bye…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fuck it…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I was a fool for thinking Cobb’s brilliance
might be what I needed at this moment of my life… Ty Cobb was the last
thing I needed. He was not misunderstood – he was understood perfectly
well. He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated Catholics – he hated
everything except himself and his own view of the world… At times it
seemed like he would drop dead in front of me… … and other times he
seemed indestructible…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I was reluctant to view the great Ty Cobb as
a pathetic character, lost in the past, paranoia, and the shallow
defense of ‘his own breeding’…</p>
<p><strong>77 int. stump’s room at hotel - day 77</strong>: Stump asleep
– full sun shines in the window. Noon. A BOTTLE CRASHES against the
headboard jarring Stump to consciousness. He looks up to see: Cobb
reading the pages in a rage. He tears them as he does.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: ‘Pathetic, paranoid, lost in the past!’ What
is this shit?!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Those are my notes! You can’t look at my
notes!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re notes – my life! You’re gonna betray
me, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You want the truth? I’m gonna tell the
truth!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Whose truth?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Mine, for crissakes, I’m the writer!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: But I’m the legend and legends are not
pathetic!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: These are just notes…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Don’t you understand anything about
‘greatness’?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Maybe you should find another writer.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There’s not enough time left.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m entitled to my opinions –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now that’s pathetic. Who gives a good God damn
about the opinions of Al Stump?! What people want to know about is Ty
Cobb! And they don’t want to know who he hates ’cause everybody hates
somebody! They don’t wanta know if he had two wives or ten! They don’t
wanta know if he hit women or if they hit him!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You think they wanta know how to steal second
base?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yes! Precisely!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Well I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh, oh, oh… I get it. You’re one of them
college psychology type guys. You wanta find the missing piece to finish
the puzzle known as the Madman Cobb – you think you’re the next
Hemingway but you’re just a moderate success in a moderate-sized
pond.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fuck you, Cobb! I’m much more than a moderate
success!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s it, now you’re showing some life. You
want psychology? I’ll give you some fucking psychology!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father was a great man…</p>
<p>****: A horse shakes its head, attached to a buggy. A man pats the
horse and ties it to a tree.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father told my mother he was going out of
town for the weekend on business. But he didn’t go. He came back ’cause
he thought she was being unfaithful…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I don’t know why he thought it – ’cause my
mother was a wonderful woman – but he thought it.</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. house - night 80</strong>: The father climbing up the
trellis onto the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father thought he would catch the man who
was trying to steal his wife from him… catch him in the act…</p>
<p><strong>close on woman</strong>: She turns and looks toward the bed.
We don’t see whatever she’s looking at.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s pov</strong>: The window. It starts to open.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father had high standards… the highest. He
believed in quality… he believed in education… he believed in God… he
believed in me… he believed in my mother… But on that night he seemed
like a prowler… and so –</p>
<p><strong>82 ext. balcony - night 82</strong>: A SHOTGUN BLAST takes
out Cobb’s father’s stomach and he reels back onto the balcony. He rolls
to his elbows and looks up.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My mother killed my father… shot him in the
belly… And then blew his head clean off…</p>
<p><strong>82 continued: 82</strong>: A SECOND SHOTGUN BLAST takes his
head off.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: How’s that? A pretty God damn good piece of
psychology, eh? That what you’re looking for? The childhood incident
that explans me?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well I was a prick before it happened and a
bigger prick after it happened so stick that up your Sigmund Freud
ass!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Your mother killed your father?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And you ain’t printing it.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Not if I say so. I don’t think you understand
something – I have final editorial approval of the book.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No, I do. I always have it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Did you read your contract?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It’s my standard contract. I just signed. I
would never have agreed to this if you had final approval.</p>
<p><strong>83 continued: 83</strong>: Cobb calmly picks up the phone and
hands it to Stump.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Call your agent.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Hello? Charlie? Al… I’m in Reno… yeah… things
are fine… Yeah, listen… I’m just checking… did we give away final
editorial approval on this Cobb book? We did? Cobb has it? Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well, you were pretty stupid to give up
approval, weren’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fuck you, Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Fuck me? Why me? Why you mad at me? Your agent
made the deal, your lawyer, your publisher, you didn’t even read the
contract because you trusted them! Who the hell ever trusted a lawyer or
an agent?! If I was Al Stump, the guy I’d be pissed off at would be Al
Stump!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Listen to me, you son of a bitch – if you die
before the book is finished, I’ll write the story I want.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: But I ain’t dying first.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’ll write slow.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’ll die slow.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now get dressed so we can go find some
women…</p>
<p><strong>louis prima and group</strong>: ’That old black magic has me
in That old black magic that you</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Look’t that – hundred bucks says I get in her
pants before dawn.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: My God – it’s Mona… Ra-mona… We met her at
the hotel…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I don’t remember…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Cigarettes, gentlemen? Cigars? We stockpiled
some Havanas before Senor Castro did his little number.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Coupla Monte Cristos, Ramona, number
twos.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: At the hotel – checking in.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Ohyeah, you were the asshole.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Excuse me, young lady, I must apologize for
the behavior of my friend – he has a crude side.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I accept.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Ramona… Spanish name… lovely… it means
‘moonlit garden of the gods’…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Actually it’s German and means ‘wise
protectoress’ but thanks for the thought…</p>
<p><strong>louis prima</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very
much, you’re a great crowd … I have been informed that we have a
celebrity with us tonight who is a legend, a man who truly needs no
introduction…</p>
<p><strong>louis prima</strong>: … so let’s give a Harrah’s Casino warm
welcome to the greatest baseball player of all time, the one and only Ty
Cobb!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: ‘Moonlit garden of the gods’?</p>
<p><strong>back onstage - louis prima</strong>: motions to his band.</p>
<p><strong>louis prima</strong>: And this one’s for the Georgia
Peach!</p>
<p><strong>louis prima/keely smith</strong>: No gal made has got a shade
on Two left feet but oh so sweet is</p>
<p><strong>louis prima</strong>: The great Ty Cobb! C’mon up here!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: They want you, Ty –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Of course they want me.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The greatest baseball player of all time.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I don’t know baseball from shmaseball but I
know a nice man when I see one and I also know it’s time for my coffee
break. Hasta luego.</p>
<p><strong>back onstage</strong>: As Cobb arrives…</p>
<p><strong>louis prima and group</strong>: Fellas, she can’t get, are
fellas, Georgia made her, Georgia claimed</p>
<p><strong>louis prima</strong>: My great pleasure, sir – I’ve always
wanted to ask you something, Mr. Cobb, with all the great ballplayers
playing right now – how well do you think you’d do against today’s
players?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well, I figure against today’s pitchers I’d
only hit about .275, .280…</p>
<p><strong>louis prima</strong>: That’s amazing, Mr. Cobb, considering
your lifetime average is nearly a hundred points higher. Why do you
think you’d only hit .275 against today’s pitchers?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Because I’m 72 fucking years old, that’s why,
God damn it. Give me that thing.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: First of all I wanta thank you for that song,
’Sweet Georgia Brown… it’s a great song about my home state and I
appreciate it… That song has become the theme song for the Harlem
Globetrotters… It’s too bad such a fine song had to be stole by a buncha
niggers playing a faggot game in their underwear…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: ’Course the Globetrotters are owned by a Jew
named Saperstein so whadda you expect?</p>
<p><strong>louis prima</strong>: Thank you very much. Another round of
applause for the Georgia Peach, Ty Cobb!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I got the mike, Dago – gimme a God damn
minute. Nobody’s got respect for their elders any more.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now let me explain to you how to hit a
baseball. It’s a lost art. Ever since that half-nigger Ruth started
hitting home runs, the skill, the art, and the science have been
lost.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now, say this is a bat…</p>
<p><strong>casino manager</strong>: Let’s just haul him off –</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: That’s Ty Cobb! He’ll fucking kill
me!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You see, the bat is like a wand, a magic wand…
it should be caressed, held like a woman… like a woman who’s really in
need of a man…</p>
<p><strong>offstage</strong>: The Casino Manager winces and
consults.</p>
<p><strong>casino manager</strong>: Oh God, here we go…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hitting a baseball is really very easy… you
can’t force it… you can’t overpower it… you go with the pitch… you let
the bat do the work… it’s all rhythm and flow…</p>
<p><strong>85 int. casino bar - night 85</strong>: Stump sees Ramona at
the bar, her cigarette/cigar tray on the bar. She’s smoking and working
her way through a tall drink. He approaches her.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You again? You could learn some manners from
your friend.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’ll try harder. You’re a beautiful
woman.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: It’s the wig.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: The damn thing itches but it’s good for
tips. Give me a scratch, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Turn you on? Hey, Harvey, another round. On
him.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Vodka and grapefruit juice.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Your wig’s crooked.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Does it bother you?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No, no… I was just –</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You wanta go to bed with me, right?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You want money?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I’m not a whore! I don’t screw for money?!
Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I mean I’m not good
at this.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Just divorced, huh?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Not yet…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: It’s written all over ya. Giant letters
right across the forehead. D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Ha! Plain as day.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It’s obvious, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Obvious. So, if ya wanta pay me to screw, I
won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Then I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Screw or pay?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Whichever.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: So ya don’t wanta screw?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No, I do.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: All this ambiguity – I see why she’s
divorcing ya.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I don’t know what I’m saying or doing
anymore… I’m trying to speak my heart.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She said
‘okay’ – then I realized maybe I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Then go back to her.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Then quit crying. You want a divorce, you
don’t want a divorce, you’re asking marital advice from a woman you’re
trying to get in the sack – Jeez Louise!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m not myself.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Who is?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Another round, Harvey. This assignment has me
befuddled. I’m supposed to tell the world that a monster is really a
prince. I’m supposed to lie.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You being paid?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Then it’s not a lie. It’s a job. Quit
agonizing – take the money, do what you gotta do, and get it over
with.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Then quit.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: For godsakes why not?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He knows greatness. I’m in the presence of
greatness. I want to learn about greatness.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Greatness is overrated.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Maybe you’re right, maybe you’re right…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: So what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I want to be in someone’s arms tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Oh that. Why do men have such a hard time
saying what they want?</p>
<p><strong>86 int. stump’s hotel room - night 86</strong>: Stump and
Ramona stagger in drunkenly – they are awkward and passionate.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Wait, wait… don’t drink too much.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Ya think I won’t be able to screw if I’m too
drunk?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Well… yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Screwed, stewed, and tattooed!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: C’mere… I want to hold you.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You’re so thoughtful – the others are trying
to get me drunk and you’re trying to keep me sober. You’d be good
husband material.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Not so fast –</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I didn’t mean –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>86 continued: 86</strong>: They embrace – and hold each other
fully, doing nothing but holding on. Stump relaxes.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I’m not a whore.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Shh, shh… I know, I know…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You two-timing bastard! You God damn Judas
Iscariot! You stealing my girl! I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: She’s not ‘your’ girl!</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: What’re you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re coming with me!</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I don’t want to!</p>
<p><strong>87 int. hotel - cobb’s room - night 87</strong>: Cobb throws
Ramona to the floor and locks the door. Her wig falls off. Cobb picks it
up and stares at it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What’s this?!</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: My hair.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Put it back on.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Who are you again?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I am the Georgia Peach. I have 4,191 base hits
in 11,429 at- bats, 920 stolen bases, 2,244 runs scored, and 92 batting
records… And I want you to undress.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: That don’t scare me ’cause if you kill me
I’ll be dead and you ain’t gonna screw a dead lady.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I might.</p>
<p><strong>87 continued: 87</strong>: She stares at the madman.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You’re right. You might.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Take your clothes off.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You got big tits. I like big tits.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: They aren’t so big. They’re average,
actually – but these bras are great. Push ’em right up there. I owe a
lot to the bras and wigs. A girl needs what she needs –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shut up. Take it off.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shy, huh? Get on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re a beauty. Roll over.</p>
<p><strong>close on her face</strong>: Terror and tears.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Mr. Cobb, I –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What I coulda done with you in my prime…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I’m sure you –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: What do you want from me?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Roll over.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I want you to do exactly what I say…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Ramona!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Exactly what I say…</p>
<p><strong>89 continued: 89</strong>: Cobb pulls a stack of bills from
his bag.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: A thousand dollars…</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Do what you gotta do and get it over with,
Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I want you to tell everyone you meet that you
fucked me and I was the best fuck you ever had.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: That’s all?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: For a thousand bucks? Hell yes.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’m looking at the most beautiful woman in the
world, do you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And I’m dead down here! Dead! Nothing! And
it’s been like that for over two years! Nothing! Now get outta here
before I hit you!</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Georgia Peach my ass – Georgia trash is what
you are!</p>
<p><strong>89 continued: 89</strong>: Ramona grabs her clothes and runs
from the room, past Stump who has heard it all. He enters Cobb’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: She was a great piece of ass, Stumpy, best I
ever had…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Good, good…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Have we missed the Testimonial Dinner?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No we haven’t, Ty… now get some sleep…</p>
<p><strong>close on cobb</strong>: asleep. Even in sleep, dying, he is
twitching and full of fragments of unspent energy.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He slept for days. I thought he was gone for
sure. But even in sleep he was restless and in motion, a fire always
burning in his belly…</p>
<p><strong>90 int. hotel - stump’s room - day 90</strong>: Stump at the
typewriter, pounding away without interruption.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: By this time I was working on two manuscripts
– one was his version, My Life In Baseball – which for better or worse
was a history of how to steal second base or how to hit the breaking
ball to the opposite field.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It contained nothing about his parents, much
less the death of his father at the hands of his mother…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: … It contained nothing about his children and
ex-wives, none of whom would even speak to him… It contained no insights
from his friends because I couldn’t find any.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It was a baseball book and I kept it in the
typewriter for him to discover and amend… It was a book I never planned
to publish.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The second version, my version, was written
on legal pads and hotel stationery and cocktail napkins and anything I
could scrape together without drawing his attention… I kept my version
in a box at the bottom of my suitcase –</p>
<p><strong>92 continued: 92</strong>: Stump packs “his” version into a
box, hiding it deep in his suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The whole thing had become an agonizing death
watch, and most days I couldn’t believe the son of a bitch wouldn’t
die…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Nothing like a cigarette girl and thirty hours
of sleep to invigorate a man, Stumpy! You look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Been writing, Ty…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well let’s see how we’re doing…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yes, God damn it, Stumpy, yes! Now you’re
getting it! None of this Sigmund Freud bullshit! Baseball, Stumpy,
baseball! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You understand! People are no damn good but
you’re different! You’re okay, Stumpy, you get it! And I can trust
you…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Now let’s go roll us some dice, Alimony, I
feel a hot hand coming on!</p>
<p><strong>93 int. casino - night 93</strong>: Cobb and Stump approach
the gaming tables and as they do, Cobb is recognized and approached for
autographs. He signs as he walks, suddenly gracious in this moment.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Y’see how it works, Stumpy… they boo ya your
whole career, then when you’re about to kiss off, they put ya on a
pedestal. That’s what being a legend’s all about.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Send the dice to the Peach, boys, and belly up
to the bar…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Stumpy, what is that?!</p>
<p><strong>pov - ramona and willie</strong>: are rolling dice at a
nearby table. They appear friendly, not intimate, two among twelve.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My girl went for the nigger?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I think they’re just next to each other by
accident.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Mona! You with that nigger!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Willie! Is she with you?!</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: Ramona seizes the moment and
kisses Willie on the cheek, draping herself all around him as if they
were close. The intention is strictly to get back at Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: This is my man, Mr. Cobb, and he’s all
man.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My girl with my nigger!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: She’s not your girl and he’s not your –</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: He’s got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Mr. Cobb!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What is the world coming to?!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: We’re leaving, we’re leaving! There’s no
reason to press charges!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Do you know who I am?!</p>
<p><strong>security man</strong>: You’re a crazy old fool, that’s who
you are!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Back off, God damn it! We’re leaving!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Where we going, Stumpy, I wanta find us some
more women!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty, Ty, Ty, calm down. It’s time for the
testimonial dinner!</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. reno arch - dawn 94</strong>: Stump’s car passes
under the arch, heading out of town, and we go to voice over:</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Actually the testimonial dinner at the Hall
of Fame was still weeks away, but it was the only thing that got him
calmed down enough to get us out of town without getting thrown in jail
– or getting somebody killed.</p>
<p><strong>95 ext. route 66 - day 95</strong>: The car takes Stump and
Cobb eastward.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: And as we headed across country, Cobb as
usual was oblivious to the chaos he’d left in his wake. In fact he was
buoyed with new enthusiasm at the prospects of seeing his cronies once
again…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Y’know something, Alimony, I believe you’re
the best friend I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Swear on a Bible, Stumpy – I feel I can trust
you now.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I was disturbed, to say the least, that he
felt we were friends – but at least for the moment it made things
bearable. And he started talking – the world according to Ty Cobb…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And then this fat ass named Babe Ruth came
into the league and damn near destroyed the game of baseball… We all
thought he was gonna eat and fuck his way outta the league but he hung
around for a few years –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: ‘Hung around’? He was – – next to you – the
greatest player of all time. He hit 714 home runs?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Anybody can hit home runs. Now excuse me, I
got work to do…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Sorry, Ty –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I didn’t care that they cheered and adored
Ruth – I cared that they respected his ballplaying – Christ, they built
Yankee Stadium for him with a 297-foot right field line. My sister
Florence could hit the ball 297 feet!</p>
<p><strong>97 ext. stadium - day 97</strong>: Game in progress – Detroit
vs. New York.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Whenever we got into a fight with the New
Yorkers, 24 of our guys would fight 24 of their guys and me and Ruth
would take on each other!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: During the day, we worked on his version of
the story. At night I worked on mine…</p>
<p><strong>100 stump 100</strong>: alone in a room, is writing on pads
of paper.</p>
<p><strong>100 continued: 100</strong>: He pours another drink and
lights a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I was drinking like a fish, smoking
cigarettes again, and now lying about the hidden manuscript. And by
writing two versions without telling him, I was becoming something Cobb
was not. I was becoming a liar.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Fabulous stuff, Stumpy, just brilliant. You’re
a genius.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Thanks, Ty…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I love reading about me.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Goddamn it, who’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He shot up his share of motels for all the
usual reasons – guests were too noisy, he couldn’t get any sleep, it
didn’t matter – he was always boiling over…</p>
<p><strong>101 continued: 101</strong>: Stump leads Cobb back inside and
calms the locals.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: … and I became expert at keeping the peace
wherever we went…</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: as Stump helps him shoot up.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I also became expert at finding his veins…
Which always revived him…</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. somewhere on route 66 - day 103</strong>: The car is
parked by the side of the highway. Cobb stands with the tape recorder
next to an endless plain of flat desert or rolling farmland. The hood is
up on the car, steam spills from the radiator. And Cobb is dictat- ing
like Marc Antony.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: … by the age of 25 I was a millionaire, by the
age of 30 a multi-millionaire, by the age of 35…</p>
<p><strong>105 int. car - day 105</strong>: Stump driving as Cobb
babbles away into the tape recorder.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Somewhere along the way I’d gone from
biographer to stenographer to chauffeur to nurse… I was the only thing
keeping the bastard alive… and I kept hoping he’d die.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Y’know, Stumpy, with a friend like you, I just
might go on forever…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Where were we – ohyeah – then, at the age of
42, I batted .323 which was an embarrassment to me but would be a career
for anyone else…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Until, by the grace of God, we arrived –
days, weeks, months later, I don’t know – in Cooperstown, New York, for
his beloved testimonial dinner…</p>
<p><strong>106 ext. baseball field - dusk 106</strong>: The ball field –
No game. Nearby, a set of buildings. The Baseball Hall of Fame. Stump’s
car pulls into town.</p>
<p><strong>107 ext. abner doubleday motel - dusk 107</strong>: A classic
50’s motel.</p>
<p><strong>108 int. motel - dusk 108</strong>: Stump and Cobb get
dressed for the testimonial dinner. A black-tie affair, Stump has to
help Cobb finish dressing. Cobb is full of boyish enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re gonna meet great athletes, great
warriors, great men at this Hall of Fame dinner, Stumpy. None of this
modern, pansy bullshit –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’ve been looking forward to this for a long
time –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You fucking liar. You’ve been hoping I’d die
first.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You got me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I got you right. But it’s okay ’cause I need
your help.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Cobb here?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m Mickey Cochrane.</p>
<p><strong>stum</strong>: Jesus. Ty, it’s Mickey Cochrane.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Where’s your tux?</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: I don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I sent you money for it.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: It didn’t arrive.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You drank it, you mean. You can’t go to the
Hall of Fame like that. I won’t allow it.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Things have been rough, Ty.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There’s two things a man should never do –
complain or explain. Now go buy a God damn tux!</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: The stores are closed.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: How could you be so good behind the plate and
so bad everywhere else!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Operator? What’s the best men’s shop in town.
Who owns it? Jack who? Gimme his home number. Better yet, ring him up
for me. Jack?! This is Ty Cobb. Go down to your shop and open it up and
sell a tux to the great Mickey Cochrane. And sell him a cumberbund and a
shirt and a bow tie and some God damn cologne. He smells like shit.
What’s the address? He’ll be there in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: God damn it, Mickey, ya gotta give a better
effort.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Thanks, Ty.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: He’s lost, Stumpy, the poor man’s been lost
ever since he took a fastball in the ear.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You take care of him?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: For years – but that ain’t goin’ in the
book.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Jesus, Ty, why not?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Because it would embarrass him.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I don’t wanta take the cane tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You’ve got to have your cane.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I don’t have to have anything – if you stay
near me… in case I wobble or something… just a firm hand right here…
That’ll keep me upright. I’d appreciate it. Now how do I look?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You look like the greatest ballplayer of all
time. You going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’ll be okay when I hear the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>109 ext. hall of fame building - night 109</strong>: A crowd
of locals has gathered and is cheering as the great old warriors of
baseball get out of one limo after another and pass a phalanx of
security guards, television cameras, and photogaphers. A P.A. ANNOUNCER
presents each one.</p>

<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Thank you, my friend…</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Hello, Mr. Cobb, good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>110 int. hall of fame - banquet room - night 110</strong>: An
orchestra is playing “Georgia On My Mind” as Cobb holds court at his
table of honor. The great old players keep coming up to him, renewing
old acquaintances. The first is WAHOO SAM CRAWFORD, 80’s, a contemporary
and at one time both teammate and adversary of young Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Sam Crawford, Ty, Long time no see.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Good to see you, Sam. You doin’ okay?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m alive, Ty, I’m alive…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: The boys’ll get together later and have a
little party, eh?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Be some parties tonight, Peach…</p>
<p><strong>110 continued: 110</strong>: ROGERS HORNSBY, 60’s, moves in
as Wahoo Sam Crawford moves on.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Stumpy, meet Rogers Hornsby, next to me the
greatest hitter of all time –</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: How d’ya do. You’re looking good, Ty…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I look like shit and you know it. We’ll have a
real smoker later, eh?</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Ohyeah… we’ll tear it up good…</p>
<p><strong>baseball m.c.</strong>: Welcome to Cooperstown, ladies and
gentlemen. We’re here to acknowledge the greatest ballplayers of all
time, those men still gracing our presence who were among the earliest
inductees into the Hall of Fame. Waner, Hubbell, Foxx, Cochrane,
Hornsby, Traynor – these are the giants, the Old Masters of our
craft…</p>
<p><strong>baseball m.c.</strong>: But the greatest of all is with us
tonight – simply put, the best ballplayer ever – Tyrus Raymond Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>baseball m.c.</strong>: We have gathered from the archives
some film on Mr. Cobb… lights, please…</p>
<p><strong>110 continued: 110</strong>: The lights dim – a giant screen
is lowered, and the screen fills with old black and white footage of
Cobb in action.</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: This rare footage of Ty Cobb reflects
his love of children, and they admired him by the thousands…</p>
<p><strong>film - cobb</strong>: posing with kids in uniforms. He clowns
with them, tousling their hair, knocking off their caps.</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: On another occasion he partakes in a
Donkey Baseball game, showing his not-so-well-known lighter side…</p>
<p><strong>film - cobb</strong>: on a donkey in a Donkey Baseball
game.</p>

immortals, Babe Ruth and Tris Speaker…</p>

off the field, and of course were accused of fixing some games by
pitcher Dutch Leonard…</p>
<p><strong>113 cobb’s pov - film 113</strong>: Cobb and Speaker
carousing with obvious gambler types.</p>
<p>****: Cobb’s POV of the film is subjective and dif- ferentiated from
the film everyone else is seeing. We,</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: Cobb and Speaker were clearly
involved with unsavory gamblers, but finally were acquitted by Judge
Landis, though many questions remain unanswered –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What the hell is this?!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It’s a great film –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Me and Speaker and the fix?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I think the medication’s getting to you, Ty –
I’m watching you run the bases.</p>
<p><strong>116 close on cobb 116</strong>: Staring at the screen.</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: Cobb’s unique batting style led to an
unprecedented 12 batting championships and a lifetime average of .367
which places him far above the field…</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: His ruthless competitive spirit has
sometimes been called psychopathic…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Al, what are you seeing?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Your batting stroke.</p>
<p><strong>119 cobb’s pov - film - cobb in uniform 119</strong>: climbs
into the stands and starts attacking a heckler with his fists.</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: In an infamous incident on August xx,
19xx, Cobb attacked a heckler who turned out to have no arms or legs,
and was briefly suspended for the incident…</p>
<p><strong>120 cobb 120</strong>: stands up next to Stump, who pulls him
back down.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Stumpy, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty, I think you’re not well – I’ll take you
back to the motel.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What’re you seeing?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You and Connie Mack.</p>
<p><strong>122 cobb 122</strong>: settles back down and says nothing the
rest of the film, though he continues to see different images.</p>
<p><strong>125 cobb’s pov 125</strong>: He strikes his wife and she
falls to the floor. He stands over her defiantly.</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: Cobb and his friends were notorious
for booze and sex parties they had in the off-season, parties they
called ‘Smokers,’ which took place in various hunting cabins they would
fill with hookers…</p>
<p><strong>cobb’s pov - naked stripper</strong>: on a table gyrates to a
room so thick with smoke that Cobb and his cronies are barely visible
sitting around the room, a hooker on each lap, bottles of booze
flowing.</p>
<p><strong>126 close on cobb 126</strong>: He rubs his eyes. What is
this?</p>
<p><strong>close on cochrane, hornsby, waner brothers et al.</strong>:
as they watch the same film Stump is watching.</p>
<p><strong>127 film - cobb 127</strong>: rounds third and slides home in
a spray of dirt.</p>
<p><strong>127 continued: 127</strong>: FREEZE FRAME as the Narrator
wraps it up.</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: And when he retired in 1929, Cobb
left behind 92 batting records and a legacy of greatness that may never
be approached.</p>
<p><strong>129 int. large local hotel - later that night 129</strong>:
Cobb and Stump move through the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Crawford and Foxx have something cooking in
Room 212 –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Over here, Ty.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I never partied with these boys but they had a
reputation.</p>
<p><strong>room 212</strong>: They knock. JIMMY FOXX opens the door a
crack.</p>
<p><strong>foxx</strong>: Ty.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You got some booze?</p>
<p><strong>foxx</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I do. Who’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>foxx</strong>: Me, Sam and Pie.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Got any women in there?</p>

<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Me and Stumpy want some action.</p>

<p><strong>traynor</strong>: And this is Mrs. Traynor.</p>
<p><strong>foxx</strong>: Pearl, meet Ty Cobb and –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Al Stump.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hello, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>foxx</strong>: Hornsby’s got something on the third floor –
maybe more what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You sure you’re up for this?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’ve never been readier!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Rajah!</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: You ain’t comin’ in, Ty.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’s me! An’ Stumpy here!</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: You’re a bastard and you ain’t coming to
our party.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Who’s in there?!</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Me and Mickey an’ a coupla broads.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Let me talk to Mickey.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Ty…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Ya look good in that tux, Mick.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: I can’t let ya in, Ty. It’s Rogers’ party.
I’m an invited guest.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: God damn it, let me in!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Presidents of the United States of America
used to invite me to the White House to drink their Scotch and smoke
their cigars and fuck their women.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Let’s go to the motel, Ty…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Let me in, God damn it! I invented this game!
Let me in!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Let’s go home, Ty, this isn’t a good place to
be…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I fought for players’ rights and salary
increases and unions while all you crawled around on your knees begging
massa’ for bread crumbs just thankful for a job!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Open up, God damn it! Ballplayers can make big
money but they’re too stupid! You’re all too stupid! The hell with
ya!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Take me back to the Hall!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I appreciate your coming.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: For Mr. Cobb, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. hall of fame - night 133</strong>: The director
flips on a couple lights – the hall is partially lit. Charles stays in
the b.g., as – Cobb leads Stump past all the displays, various shrines
and photos and old bats and balls and records, until –</p>
<p><strong>133 continued: 133</strong>: Cobb sucks up the tears and
finally turns to Stump.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What did you see on that film tonight?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I saw Ty Cobb playing baseball.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s all?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I was raised in the Baptist Church but I know
that Heaven is just the ol’ oskefagus – the change-up. You swing from
your ass ’cause you think life is a fastball down the middle and after
your bat has crossed the plate and you’re all off balance and looking
stupid, the ball just kinda flutters across home, slow and juicy and
hittable, and as it crosses the plate, the ball looks at you and smiles
a nasty smile and laughs its way into the catcher’s mitt… We don’t just
lose – we’re made fools of.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You were the best.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Save the romance for the book… … and take me
home to Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Cobb parted with some of his hard- earned
money and rented a limo in order to make what he called a ‘grand
re-entrance to his beloved home town of Royston…’</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He loved the manuscript, as well he should –
it made him out to be a saint –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Greatest biography ever written –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The book, like Cobb, was almost finished. But
he was dying slower than I was writing, and like everything else, he
viewed it as a competition that he was not going to lose.</p>
<p><strong>close on cobb</strong>: Sweating, pale, hanging on. A grim
smile.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: To me, we weren’t riding to Georgia in a
limo… We were riding in a hearse…</p>
<p><strong>138 int. hearse - close on cobb - day 138</strong>: staring
out the window as the Georgia landscape passes.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: We’re here. And the fuckin’ sign needs
paint.</p>
<p><strong>139 ext. downtown royston - day 139</strong>: The limo moves
slowly and ominously through the town. Old folks, black and white,
sitting on chairs and benches in front of the stores, under awnings,
stare at the strange sight of a limo cruising slowly.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It wasn’t exactly the ‘grand re- entrance to
a home town’ that he talked about…</p>
<p><strong>close on two old black men</strong>: sitting under an awning.
They point and discuss among themselves who this could be.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My sister lives down this way… Turn right
here…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: They look kinda the same…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: When’s the last time you saw her?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: About fifteen years ago. But she understands
me… There! No… damn….</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The limo cruises slowly through a
quiet neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Maybe she moved.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There! I think…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’ll see if it’s her. Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Good day, ma’am. I’m looking for Florence
Cobb ——–.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I have your brother in the car.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Tyrus?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yes. And he’d like to see you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I don’t wish to see him.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It’s been a long time, he said. He’s not
well.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I have nothing to say to him, and wish to
hear nothing he has to say to me.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I know there’s been problems, but the family
is very important to him.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Young man, the family he talks about never
existed.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He loved his father.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: If his father, if my father, was such a
great man, why did Tyrus turn out to be so evil?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He’s dying. He just wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>142 int. limo - day 142</strong>: Stump climbs back in next
to Cobb. He motions to the driver to head off – the limo does.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It wasn’t your sister. The woman in the house
said your sister moved a long time ago… she doesn’t know where.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You cocksucking liar. My sister doesn’t want
to see me and you’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Liar?! A cocksucking liar?! Of course I’m a
liar! That’s what I’m paid to do, isn’t it?! Lie about Ty Cobb?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: If you didn’t like the job, why didn’t you
quit?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Who would take care of you?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Don’t give me the sob-sister routine.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I listen to your bullshit, I interpret and
shape and find words for your bullshit and you give me nothing but
grief!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You love being this close to greatness!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Stop the car!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I wish you’d die!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I will, Stumpy, I will…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: And go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh, I’ll do that, too. And look how convenient
you’ve made it.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: That was your sister alright, and she didn’t
want anything to do with you either!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I forgive her.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You forgive her?! That’s rich!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and
religious growth.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Religious growth?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: We all need to forgive more, Al… you oughta
try it. You’re too angry. You’re all pent up.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m angry?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Are you angry because I discovered you were a
whore? Is that it, Alimony?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m angry?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Is it the divorce? You gotta let go of it…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I love her! I don’t want a divorce!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Sure ya do. You’re just so used to
accommodating people that you don’t know what you want anymore. I
accommodate nobody.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: But you have no friends!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Do you? Who are they?! Those drunken hacks you
hang out with who all think they’re gonna write the great American novel
but all they’re gonna ever do is bitch and moan and write lousy leads
about high school football games? How about the brunette in the
courtyard? Is she your friend? I heard she fucks everybody – she must be
everybody’s friend!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’m glad we’re here – I was gonna bring you
here anyway sooner or later –</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Which Cobb of Georgia is that?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That is me.</p>
<p><strong>144 int. mausoleum - day 144</strong>: Just enough room for
the two men to stand. On either side of them are two crypts, enough for
four burial vaults. Cobb is very calm now, and lucid. Rain falls heavily
outside.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: When I die, my mother and father will be moved
in here and, in time, my dear sister, Florence will join us as well. The
family will be together again.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Under one roof? That’s romantic! You want
that in the book? Ty Cobb brings the family together at last to enter
the gates of Heaven whole!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You mock my family – you mock me.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father was a great man!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Then why are you such a bastard?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Being a bastard is a small price to pay for
greatness. I, too, am a great man.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My mother didn’t kill my father.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My father told my mother he was leaving town
for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied
up his horse…</p>
<p><strong>145 ext. moonlit road through some woods - night
145</strong>: A horse shakes its head, attached to a buggy.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: … because my father thought my mother was
being unfaithful to him…</p>
<p><strong>ext. balcony on house - night</strong>: The man climbs over
the railing and peers in the window. He pulls a pistol from his
belt.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: … he was going to catch my mother with another
man…</p>
<p><strong>146 pov shot - woman 146</strong>: Young, thin, beautiful.
She turns and looks towards a bed we cannot see.</p>
<p><strong>cob</strong>: I stood by my mother when she was tried for
murder a few months later. I said she was noble and true and loved my
father completely and the whole thing was an accident and she was
acquitted as she should have been…</p>
<p><strong>146 continued: 146</strong>: His mother looks away at
something.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Because my mother did not kill my father.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: My mother’s lover killed my father.</p>
<p><strong>close on cobb’s father</strong>: on his back staring up at
his mother’s lover.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: The last thing my father saw was the face of
the man fucking his wife!</p>
<p><strong>147 int. mausoleum - day 147</strong>: The rain pours down on
the cemetery. THUNDER. Lightning. Cobb still holds Stump by the
throat.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well?! Is that what you want?! ’Cause that’s
all I know and the only other people who know about it are dead! But it
ain’t going in the book, either, ’cause you’re the only friend I got
left, and you’re the only man I can trust.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I don’t want to be your friend! I don’t want
to feel sorry for you! So your mother’s lover blew your father’s head
off! I don’t care. You were a prick before it happened, you were a prick
after it happened, you’ve been a prick ever since, and you’re a prick
now!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Public relations are overrated.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: What the hell’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fuck the drink!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re too angry, Al, you just gotta learn to
let it out.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m gonna tell the truth about you, Cobb! I’m
gonna tell the world you hate women, Jews, and niggers!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You shouldn’t use the word ‘nigger’, Stumpy,
it’s racist and demeaning. And I don’t hate women – I’m just not very
good with ’em, which puts me in the same boat with you and every other
man I know.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You treat people like dirt!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: The children of America need heroes, Al, you
know that…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Get your hands off me!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: C’mon, Al… You’re making a fool of yourself
out here. It’s not dignified… Come in out of the rain…</p>
<p><strong>148 ext. jefferson davis motel - night 148</strong>: The rain
is thick – Yet another motel, another neon sign, and the limo parked in
front of one of the cabins.</p>
<p><strong>149 int. motel - night 149</strong>: Both men are sitting in
rocking chairs in front of a fireplace. Stump is in a bathrobe, his feet
in a big pan of warm water, a bottle of booze in his hand. He looks a
mess. Cobb is idly playing with his pistol. He’s calm,
introspective.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re an educated man… tell me what you
think…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Either my father was… inadequate … for my
mother… he was not the man I thought he was… not a great man… not even a
good man… … or my mother was… trash… a common whore… It’s that simple,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: As a boy I stood in court next to her because
suddenly I was the man of the house but as I stood there steadfastly by
her side and heard the jury say ‘not guilty’ I knew she’d been with
another man the night of the killing.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: A man must defend his mother at all times,
isn’t that right, Al? Or am I a fool?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: A man must defend his mother at all
times.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s what I thought…</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: Al Stump?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>149 continued: 149</strong>: Cobb lets the man inside –
points to Stump in the chair.</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: Mr. Al Stump?</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: I’ve been chasing you all over
the country – – I’m here to serve you papers.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Papers?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’m afraid it’s divorce, Stumpy. I know this
routine.</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: You’re being sued for
divorce.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: But my wife and I are still talking?!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yeah, and what she’s saying is ‘fuck you.’</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Fuck me? Well fuck her. No, fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You ain’t serving me no papers.</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: I’m just doing a job.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I love my wife.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: We all loved our wives, Al, that’s got nothing
to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: You’ll find somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There’s a million broads out there, Stumpy –
put down the gun.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I am not going to accommodate this man,
Tyrus.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re all mixed up. Give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: You’re absolutely right, Tyrus, I’ve been
accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here. You’ve
killed a man. I’ll kill a man.</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: No! Please, dear God! I have a
family, too!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Don’t give me that sob-sister stuff!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Al… no… Al… Al…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Life is too short to be diplomatic. A man’s
friends don’t care what he says or does. You’re my friend, Ty, right?
You’re my friend!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>man with briefcase</strong>: You’re crazy! No wonder she
wants to divorce you! You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I almost killed a man.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: A little drunken excess…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: No. I put a gun to a man’s head and pulled
the trigger. I wanted to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’s forgotten already. I saw nothing. Nothing
happened.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yes it did.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Al, listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: If I was hired to write a biography of the
greatest sportswriter of our time – a biography of Al Stump – would I
include what happened tonight? Attorneys are pigs – divorce attorneys
are lower than pigs. What happened tonight was private. An intimacy.
Your own business. Our own business. Nobody else’s. It wouldn’t belong
in a book about greatness.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Nobody’s gonna write my biography.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And when the brunette in the courtyard brushed
against you, I know what happened, Al. A warm summer breeze, the smell
of jasmine, her black hair against a white blouse – you came to life
again, you got hard – and when you saw her naked it was more than you
could bear… it’s okay, Al, it’s okay… The brunette ain’t gonna be in the
book either…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And the drinking? Well, they used to say ol’
Ty had a drinking problem but you can booze me right under the table
right now… no problem… and nobody’s God damn business, either…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I get it… I get it…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Then get some sleep. You look pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>149 continued: 149</strong>: Stump crawls on the bed toward
the pillows with the stupid grace of a drunk looking for a key under the
mat.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: He makes it to the bottle – Steadies
himself – he’s ex- hausted. He takes a deep swig from the Scotch.
Several deep gulps, enough to kill a horse, but it only helps him steady
himself. And he sees something in the suitcase – He looks down at –</p>
<p><strong>cobb’s pov - cardboard box</strong>: which Stump has been
filling with his secret manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: … ‘vicious, pathological, bubbling with
violence… Cobb’s demons were not merely exorcized on the baseball field…
they spilled over into all parts of his miserable life…’</p>
<p><strong>151 continued: 151</strong>: He rises from the chair, his
adrenaline has momentarily overwhelmed his system and he moves as a
young man.</p>
<p><strong>close on cobb</strong>: He’s crying. He shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You don’t have a point of view, Stumpy, you
ain’t worth killing…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Dear God…</p>
<p><strong>152 cobb 152</strong>: rushes into the bathroom and faces the
mirror. Blood gushes from his mouth as he coughs again.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: No… no… no… this can’t be… Absolutely not…
This is not right…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Stumpy?! No…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed by
Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive – Aw, fuck it… little late for that sob sister stuff…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: … so this is what it feels like…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Can you get me the Emory Hospital? Hello,
Ma’am? This is Ty Cobb. Can you please prepare your finest room for me?
Tomorrow morning would be fine.</p>
<p><strong>154 ext. jefferson davis motel - early next morning
154</strong>: The limousine pulls away from the motel. The rain has
stopped.</p>
<p><strong>155 int. motel - early morning 155</strong>: Stump rolls over
– The hangover is brutal. He looks worse than we’ve ever seen him. He
reaches for the bottle. Empty.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty. Tyrus. Peach…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Ty!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: God…</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: He rushes to the fireplace where only
embers now glow. He sees something –</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: ‘Dear Alimony, you lying S.O.B. – I’m checking
myself into the hospital. I think the end is near. Your Pal, Ty.’</p>
<p><strong>close on stump</strong>: Deeply alarmed.</p>
<p><strong>156 ext. emory state hospital - day 156</strong>: A cab pulls
up – Stump gets out. He’s cleaned up now, shaved, dressed neatly. He
enters.</p>
<p><strong>157 int. emory state hospital - day 157</strong>: Stump goes
up to a reception desk and introduces himself.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I’m here to see…</p>
<p><strong>157 continued: 157</strong>: A CRASHING NOISE and shouting
erupt from down the hall. A tray of food is thrown out into the
hall.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Get the hell outta here! You call this a
hospital?! You call this food?! You know who I am?!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: … Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Be careful. He’s got a gun and we
haven’t been able to get it away from him.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I know, I know…</p>
<p><strong>nurse #1</strong>: He doesn’t want visitors.</p>
<p><strong>158 int. cobb’s hospital room - day 158</strong>: Cobb sits
in bed – His gun and his money are next to him. He’s giving orders,
ranting and raving in a classic Cobb rage. A bottle hangs from a pole,
feeding his arm. A doctor and two Nurses are present, trying to deal
with him.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hey, Stumpy, where you been? You can’t believe
the shit they call food in this joint. You get some sleep? Good. I had
quite a read last night…</p>
<p><strong>nurse #1</strong>: Excuse me, sir, but I need to draw some
more blood.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Put a bucket under my chin and I’ll cough up a
couple pints for ya.</p>
<p><strong>nurse #1</strong>: I have to do it this way.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well don’t poke around too long.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: She’s a nice piece of ass, eh, Stumpy? You
come back later and climb on the big fella?</p>
<p><strong>nurse #1</strong>: It’s against regulations, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: So you read the book.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yeah, God damn it, I thought I could trust you
– I used to be able to figure out people better.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: That book is the truth.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re a God damn romantic! The truth is a
whore! Just like you and just like my mother!</p>
<p><strong>nurse #2</strong>: A Mr. Barton is here to see you. He says
he’s the chairman of the board of Coca Cola.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Tell the son of a bitch to go downstairs and
have a Pepsi – I got no time for business.</p>
<p><strong>158 continued: 158</strong>: Nurse #1 tapes Cobb’s arm and
escapes with the blood sample.</p>
<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: I need to take your blood pressure,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’s high. What else you need to know?</p>
<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: I have to do it.</p>
<p><strong>older doctor</strong>: Mr. Cobb. We cannot allow you to have
a gun in here.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Come and get it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Y’know, Stumpy, my oldest son was a doctor – a
hacksaw artist, that’s all they are – He died of a brain tumor when he
was forty – hadn’t spoke to me in fifteen years ’cause I was such a
rotten father – put that in your God damn book!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Bad, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I don’t know which version of your life I’m
going to publish. I really don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There ya go again! Accommodating me and you
don’t have to! I died faster than you could write!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Get the hell outta here! Everybody but Stumpy!
Out!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You fooled me, Stumpy, nobody ever fooled me
but you pulled it off! I thought we were pals!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I didn’t know what I was getting into with
this job.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Quit explaining yourself! Stand by your
convictions! You beat the great Ty Cobb! I respect that! But if you
print it – print it all! My second son weighed 300 pounds and he died of
a heart attack in the arms of a hooker in Paso Robles. My other son I
lost all track of and my two daughters won’t speak to me and my two ex-
wives won’t and my siter you know won’t! Print it all! And Ty Cobb can’t
get it up anymore! Print that too!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: It’s all… confusing…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’s not! It’s simple! You won! Tell the world
that the greatest ballplayer who ever lived was also the biggest
bastard! Who cares now?! I give you permission and my blessing! From
here on it’s your story!</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Here’s a little something might help.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Where’s my money?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Right here, Peach… next to your gun.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Stumpy, there’s nothing wrong with wanting
glory. Now get the hell outta here.</p>
<p><strong>159 int. hospital hallway - day 159</strong>: Doctors,
nurses, orderlies, men in suits – all are waiting nervously outside the
door as Stump emerges.</p>
<p><strong>older doctor</strong>: What about the gun? Did you get
it?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Naw, I didn’t get the gun…</p>
<p><strong>pov shot - doctors, et al.</strong>: rushing back into Cobb’s
room. And –</p>
<p><strong>160 ext. “welcome to royston” sign - edge of town - day
160</strong>: A teenage boy re-paints the faded sign that reads “Home of
Ty Cobb”. The luster returns to the old sign.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I gave a few bucks to a local kid to re-paint
the sign, and disappeared for a while to finish the manuscripts… And
wait for Cobb to die… And while I waited, Ernest Hemingway blew his
brains out, Getty bought Honolulu Oil Company, and the brunette in the
courtyard ran away with a handsome young lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: And on July 17, 1961… Ty Cobb died quietly in
his sleep. I don’t believe it was quiet, nothing he did was quiet, but
that’s what the newspaper writer said who wrote the lead and we all know
that writers never lie…</p>
<p><strong>country gospel</strong>: ‘There is a fountain filled with
Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins…’</p>
<p><strong>161 ext. cemetery - day 161</strong>: The mausoleum – The
coffin sits by the open crypt.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Somebody hired a singer…</p>
<p><strong>country gospel singer</strong>: ‘And sinners plunged beneath
that Lose all their guilty stains…’</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: … but it was the grimmest damn funeral
service I’d ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: He left all his money to his family, though
no members of it managed to attend the funeral, and with the rest he
founded a hospital in his own name and an educational trust fund for
poor Georgia children.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Only three ballplayers attended the service –
three oldtimers who he’d been supporting financially for many years, a
fact he didn’t want made public.</p>
<p><strong>pov shot - school bus</strong>: pulls in and unloads – Dozens
of Little Leaguers in uniform join in the service.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Somebody rounded up some Little Leaguers,
probably so the press photographers would have some sob sister photos…
the sort Cobb hated… except the press didn’t bother coming. I’ll give
him this – the family was under one roof again.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Stump turns and slips quietly out of
the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I called my publisher. The book was ready.
Only I didn’t know which one to turn in.</p>
<p><strong>162 ext. sportsman’s lounge - late afternoon 162</strong>:
The regulars are still there, still drinking, still griping.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: … so a woman goes into a bar with a duck under
her arm, sits down next to a drunk who looks up and says, ‘Where’d you
find that pig?’ An’ the woman says ‘That’s no pig, that’s a duck.’</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: An’ the drunk says, ‘I know, I was talking to
the duck.’</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Al!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stranger! Another round on me!</p>
<p><strong>cronies</strong>: Long time no see, etc…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Good to see you guys… how’s it goin’? Alan,
how’s that novel coming? Must be about done by now?</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: Uh, actually, I haven’t started it yet… been
kinda busy…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We all been busy…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yeah, I know how it is…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We read that Cobb died.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Yeah… finally gave up the ghost.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So? What was he like?</p>
<p><strong>mud</strong>: Were the stories true or were they
exaggerated?</p>
<p><strong>162 continued: 162</strong>: The drinks arrive. Stump plays
with his, swirling the drink around the ice with his finger, considering
his answer.</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: Tell us the truth, man, was he a
monster?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Or was he just one of the guys?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The truth?</p>
<p><strong>cronies</strong>: Ohyeah, the absolute truth, no bullshit,
give it to us straight, etc…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The truth?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: A prince and a great man has fallen.</p>
<p><strong>cronies</strong>: Yes, awright, we knew it… etc…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Helluva guy, eh?</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: A helluva guy, a great man, a misunderstood
artist, a fierce competitor but a sweet man at heart… a gentle soul…</p>
<p><strong>163 ext. dirt ballfield in georgia - dusk 163</strong>: Some
kids play baseball with a taped-up ball, patched up bat, no uniforms,
rocks for bases. The right way.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: I published the lie and put the truth in a
closet…</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: Cobb and his father and mother were together
at last… The man had some deep, unexpressed sorrow that I could never
know. I embraced him and I hated him… And I knew I would never write a
novel, unless you considered ‘Cobb’ a work of fiction – which I did
not.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: My friends were thrilled to hear that the
Georgia Peach was a helluva guy – it excused their own failures – if
Cobb was okay, then by God, they were okay… But finally I didn’t lie for
them, or the children of America, or somesuch hogwash – finally I lied
for myself. I needed Cobb to be somebody he was not. I needed him to be
a hero. It is my weakness.</p>
<p><strong>164 continued: 164</strong>: Stump turns to walk off the
field.</p>
<p><strong>stump</strong>: The book was a moderate success…</p>
