<h1 id="youth-in-revolt">youth-in-revolt</h1>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My name… is Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My last name, which I loath, is Twisp.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The next thing you should know about me is
that I am obsessed with sex.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lately, I have become morbidly aware of my
penis.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Once a remote region accessed indifferently
for micturition, it has developed overnight into a gaudy Las Vegas of
the body.</p>
<p><strong>las vegas of the body</strong>: The pulsing neon sign outside
the club reads: NICK’S PENIS. We fly inside where we find a star-studded
floor show. Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS. A LEOPARD
leaps through a burning HOOP on stage.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I am entering the tenth grade at St. Vitus
Academy, which, I am told, is the most rigorous prep school in the East
Bay. Hopefully I will be invited to join Miss Satron’s English
Literature class.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I am a voracious reader and listen to Frank
Sinatra. So needless to say, I am still a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>still a virgin.</strong>: He pauses in thought, then
continues.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have yet to hold hands with a girl, let
alone have my winkie up her wendell.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I am an only child except for my big sister
Joanie, who has left the bosom of her family to sling hash at 35,000
feet.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom gives driver’s tests at the Department of
Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She used to keep Dad up to date on all the
motor statutes he was violating. This is one of the reasons they got
divorced.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom’s boyfriend, Jerry is a long distance
trucker, though his ultimate ambition is to be on state disability.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve been struggling to think of a commendable
thing to say about Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No luck. His grey matter registers at cretin
and the needle doesn’t budge.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dad is a copywriter for agricultural
magazines.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’d like to own a more prestigious model of
BMW, but, as he often reminds me, he is burdened with crippling child
support payments.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lacey is Dad’s latest bimbette. She is twenty
and a recently minted alumna of Stanfort.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: He pulls open the drawer again - the
pornography collection.</p>
<p><strong>nick’s pov</strong>: of the room shaking, accompanied by his
heavy breathing. His eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of
his room.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My mother is the one who painted my room to
look like Dolly Parton’s boudoir. She read this color was used in
hospitals to calm mental patients.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll tell you what I told her. I am not
mentally ill.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m just a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Jerry? Where did that car come from?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s a ’62 Lincoln convertible. Like the one
Kennedy was shot in.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Except his was black and yours is white. And
dirty.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: See that. I was going to take you and your
mom for a spin after breakfast. But now I guess it’ll just be her and
me. You have your smart mouth to thank for that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Damn it. I guess I’ll just have to hang out
all alone at the book depository.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Jerry, I don’t understand. What happened to
the Chevy-Nova?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air
Base. A man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle.
That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: After spending twelve years with Dad, Mom has
had a string of lovers, none of whom she has asked me to approve.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m starting to think her boyfriends are like
U.S. Presidents.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just when you think they can’t get any
worse…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …she manages to find God’s Perfect
Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>on a tv screen</strong>: Nick cycles through TiVo and finds
the late night SEX DOCUMENTARY he recorded.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. estelle’s home - moments later</strong>: The door is
opened to reveal two burly, tattooed SAILORS standing on the stoop.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: Is Jerry here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He just left. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: What’s up is that hunk of shit Chevy he
sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #2</strong>: And we found evidence of a banana in the
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: So he owes us nine hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, I think he used that nine hundred
dollars to buy his Lincoln. He’s giving my mom a joyride in it now. But
he’ll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He’s pretty
stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: That can be arranged. In the meantime
we’re leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. With a note.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I like it. Very to the point. Well… See you
guys this afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I might have to kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hope you have a good reason.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding
hands with some college guy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister is just
waging psychological warfare.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Well it’s working. What am I gonna do, Nick?
I’m obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe your just not wacking off enough.</p>
<p><strong>through the binoculars</strong>: The couple hump in the
grass, her legs in the air.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: So, I’ve been taping my pecker to my right
leg at night.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: In case you haven’t heard, Lefty’s erect
member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Then I look at this issue of Better Homes and
Gardens that has a girl that looks just like Millie until it gets good
and hard. I think it’s starting to straighten out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why don’t you just have your parents take you
to the dick doctor?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Are you kidding? It would kill them to know
that I even get hard-ons.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Still, you might want to get it fixed before
asking Millie out.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: True. What if I shove it up the wrong
hole?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lefty’s grasp of the female anatomy is
somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Nick, you little shit, get down here!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, do you know anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by. They want
their money back. I guess there was a banana in the transmission.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You tell them when I was coming back?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Now why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: What are you going to do, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I think I’ll go get the Lincoln washed.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: You’re leaving? What happens when the
sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just tell him he bought the car with my
standard guarantee. Thirty days or thirty feet. Whichever comes first.
I’m in the right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, look. The sailors are here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Get rid of them!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jerry, where are you going? Just tell them you
are in the right.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: Sixty-three lousy dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That’s my life savings!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Don’t hurt him! Nick, call 911!</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: Touch that phone, kid, and you lose your
left nut.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Please. Please don’t hurt me. It’s all I got,
guys. I swear. Take the Lincoln!</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: I don’t want the Lincoln. I want my
nine-hundred dollars. I’m taking the sixty-three, which means you owe me
another eight hundred and thirty.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Eight hundred and thirty seven, actually.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or you’ll be
found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the
Bay.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wow, those guys are even dumber than I
thought. They actually think I’m stupid enough to let them muscle me
into paying.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Jerry, what are you talking about? We need
to call the police!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not some tattle-tale like your son.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Then for God’s sake, Jerry, just sell the
Lincoln and pay them!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Can’t. It’s in The Code.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: What code? The vehicular code?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Code of the streets, Babe. Code of the
streets.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Then what are you planning to do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We are going to Ukiah for a last minute
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jerry says we’ll be staying in a cabin on
Clear Lake that’s owned by a friend of his.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Goodbye, everyone! We’re going on
vacation!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Let’s blow!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not sure how this is the solution to his
problem. But I’ve decided to go along with it, seeing as I’m not rooting
for him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Jerry…? You said it was a cabin.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: C’mon Estelle. It’s real cute on the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I say the kid does the dishes and we retire
to the master bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom? Do you really like Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, how many men do you think there are
who’d be interested in a forty-one year old woman with two brats, no
money, and stretch marks?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom is a realist about everything. Except her
age. She’s forty-three.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. saunders</strong>: It’s your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders.
Church services begin at seven fifteen prompt. Donuts will be
served.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The moment I see her I know the Gods, while
having cruelly endowed me with imperfect posture and pussy postponing
pimples, had put me here for a purpose. My heart palpitates. My mind
races. I get an instant</p>
<p><strong>t.e.</strong>: Super: Sheeni glances up from her book and
looks over her shoulder at him. Nick just stares. She gives an amused
smile, almost flirtatious. Nick grins back.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Your robe is open.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Hel-lo, Excitable Boy.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store.
I’ve offered her your help in carrying her bags.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks a pantsful.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You don’t have to go to services?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: No. Much to the consternation of my
fanatical parents I have converted to atheism. Fortunately my brother,
Paul, paved the way for such transgressions.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Paul is an atheist too?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Buddhist, I believe, though we have not seen
him in some time. I myself am looking forward to being free of parental
bondage.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, your mother seems very nice, though
your father I think might be rather dim.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jerry and I share no blood links of any
kind.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sounds rather zealous.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes, even though I am no longer a believer I
always found the services wonderfully aerobic.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You could say the same thing about sex.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick, are you going to turn out like all the
other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal
pleasures?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hardly ever think about sex.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Really? I think about it all the time. It’s
the hormones at work, you know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wow. A second floor.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes. Father bought it so that he could look
down upon the world. For him, Christian humility has always been a
struggle.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, it was nice to meet you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni? Do you want to come to the beach with
me?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: What a thoughtful invitation. I’d love to,
Nick. Wait for me in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Back in a moment.</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: I understand you have invited my
daughter to the beach.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Er, yes, Mr. Saunders.</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: Aha! Then I trust, sir, you are aware
that in doing so you have entered into an oral contract to perform in
loco parentis, i.e. to provide for the safety and well- being of
aforementioned minor female.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Oh, Father, do shut up.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Let’s go, Nick. Bye, Father.</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: Vaya con Dios!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Would you mind applying this to my exposed
areas?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: My, you get turned on easily.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Oh, don’t stop, Nick. We all have our
hormones to deal with. Girls are fortunate in that it doesn’t show. For
all the world knows, my vagina could be moist with desire as we
speak.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: That’s none of your business, I’m sure.
Shall you do my front too?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m up for it.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I hope you don’t find it too stimulating,
Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m coping.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the top
now.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Thanks, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Breathless is one of my favorite films,
though it might be eclipsed by Rebel Without a Cause. I often wonder
what American cinema would be like today had Dean done more than
three.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But in
fairness, I should tell you that I have a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Trent Preston.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s he like?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Seventeen years of age, six-two, fluent in
French, plays the piano, a champion swimmer, and writes Futurist
Percussive poetry.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not familiar with Futurist Percussive
poems.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I could recite one of Trent’s if you’d
like.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Please do.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/ Safety
net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If that’s poetry, I’m a turkey scrotum.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here is an hour by hour account of the worst
night of my life.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: 1 AM. I decide it is just a case of puppy love
and look forward to the interesting women I shall meet in the
future.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: 2 AM. I conclude the only way out is suicide.
I begin to pen a poignant suicide note. Sheeni will see Trent for the
shallow pedant he is and always treasure my memory.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Turn off the damn light!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: 3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for any of the
manly, violent means of suicide. I shall swallow sleeping pills. Where
to get them, though?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: 4 AM. I can not die an inviolate virgin.
Either I find a way to get laid soon or suicide gets postponed until
after high school.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You wanna beat your meat, go outside!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: 5 AM. It will be too painful to see Sheeni
again. I shall ask Mom if we can cut our vacation short and return to
Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: 6 AM. Violent panic! I have to see Sheeni
again!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick? God what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Seven o’clock. How about breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Come back in two hours. I’m going on a hike.
You can join me if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick, where are your hiking boots, water
bottle, provisions, survey maps and compass?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Like John Muir I enter the wilderness with
nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Okay, but I have no plans to baby any
slackers.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Quite a drop.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes. Not to be morbid, but this sight has
been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Huh. Quite a hike just to end your life.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, there is a road. But I agree.
Adolescents have a tendency toward the over-dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s my journal!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Don’t get so upset Nick. Though your
handwriting is egregious, you have a fairly decent vocabulary. Although,
Trent is not an “affected twit.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Those are my private thoughts and are none of
your business!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: The lengths you say you are willing to go to
to win my heart, the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not
having me… It all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Did you mean it, Nickie?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How would you like it if I read your
journal?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: You can read it if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s in French.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: A necessity for a child in a household with
prying Christian parents.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Wouldn’t you like to know. That last passage
would be of particular interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Spill it! I demand full disclosure!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nickie’s got a hard-on.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: You’re still a virgin, I can tell. Maybe
that’s why I like you.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Kiss me, you wienie.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Okay, lover. Break’s over. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When can I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Get up early tomorrow and you can shower
with me in the ladies room. Five minutes to six. If you dare.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: So what’s this Sheeni girl like?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She’s got a nice rack.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>rape! raaaaape!</strong>: Suddenly the door opens. It’s
Sheeni in her robe. She reaches out and pulls Nick up.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Get out quick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Should I go to the sheriff’s now?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: No. I managed to convince Mother you were
retarded and couldn’t read the sign.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Say, where were you anyway? We said five
minutes to six.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I’m sorry. But, Nick, women are always
discreetly late. It’s expected of us.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Swell. And the punctual guy fries in the chair
for rape.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Don’t complain. At least you got to shower
with a naked woman. What are your plans today?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My parents want to go to Middletown. Jerry has
the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I should like to come with you, Nick. The
more time we spend together the better. I fear when you leave we might
never see each other again.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s your cash price?</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: I said in the ad. Thousand dollars firm.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Thousand, huh? That must be with a
guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: As is, where she is.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know. Those rusty propane tanks are a
fire hazard. The roof probably needs work. I couldn’t go above eight
hundred.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: There are mouse droppings in all the
closets, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: I might take nine fifty.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Nine hundred.</p>
<p><strong>puppies.</strong>: She brings one of them over.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Look, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All I have is a Subway card with four
stickers.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Sold.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No doubt close to the dog’s actual value.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Oh, thank you, Nickie!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I’m going to name him Albert.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: That don’t sound like any kind of name for a
dog.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I’ll have you know I’ve named him after the
deceased French writer, Albert Camus. Author of L’Etranger and other
works of existential brilliance.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni, I think I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, your hormones certainly do. And oddly
enough, my hormones like you too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni? It’s… It’s okay. We can visit each
other when I get a drivers license.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I hope that’s true, but.. It’s not that.
It’s…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: It’s my parents. They’re… I fear they will
never allow me to keep Albert.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>****: Nick, honey. Why don’t you take Albert? He could be our love
child.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: At least you could consider it, honey. For
me. I’ve never asked you for anything before.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe I could take him, but I’d have certain
conditions. I would have to be the only dad on the scene. Trent would
have to go.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: That’s asking a lot. Trent worships the
ground I walk on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s your choice. Life with me and the dog you
love. Or a pet-free existence with a shallow, egotistical poet.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: OK, Nick, I guess I don’t have any choice.
I’ll break up with Trent. But if he kills himself it’s on your
conscience.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I accept full responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, good, that’s settled.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not quite, darling. I want one more thing.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Do you have a condom?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: It has to be in a safe place. A nice
comfortable bed. With no threat of interruptions. And for relaxation and
mood setting some good red wine, preferably French. I want a new condom.
Not one that’s been riding around in your wallet for years. Consumers
rated them a while back. I suggest you get their top-rated brand. This
may take some research in the library. I’d appreciate a photocopy of the
article. Plus, for supplementary protection, I want a name brand
spermicide.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be
on the safe side?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, Nick, that, of course, is up to
you.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni. It’s
time to hit the road.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Don’t forget, darling. Red wine and Consumer
Reports.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay. Back to civilization!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have a tall mountain to climb, with many
treacherous glaciers still to cross, but finally, I have obtained a
stamped entry visa to the paradise that lay beyond.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: In short… I have a very real prospect for
getting laid.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. lincoln - day</strong>: They all stare at the empty
space where the Chevy-Nova used to be. Jerry gets a smirk of
satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You see that, Babe. They caved.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I guess they didn’t cave after all.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Boy, everything’s complete. There’s even
water in the windshield washer.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: How did they ever get it in here? My front
door can’t be more than three feet wide.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Looks like they brought it in piece by piece
and then reassembled it.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: But it would take an army of mechanics to
do all that!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy.</p>
<p><strong>stairs - continuous</strong>: He comes down the first few
steps and is met with the sight of his mother and sister staring up at
him.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, your sister came all the way from LA
for a weekend visit!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Stellar.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Can someone do something about the mutt?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: I don’t know, Jerry. Can someone do
something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room?</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Yeah, I noticed that. What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jerry tried to outsmart a few sailors. It’s
been an amusing saga.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: OK, Babe, I guess when I come back from my
next haul I’ll just have to take it apart piece by piece.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Up to anything scandalous these days,
Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I was going to ask you the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Not that it’s any of your business, but I’ve
taken a class to improve my posture.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: I think Joanie looks very nice. And she has
a new boyfriend too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you meet him in posture class?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Really now? Are you on each others’ Myspace
pages?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hardly. Sheeni believes the internet will be
the end of literacy.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: So it’s to be a torturous snail mail
exchange, huh?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: More like the occassional collect call.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Collect calls? And just who do you expect
to pay for that?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car is put
together?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, thanks. Auto mechanics doesn’t interest
me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: See, Estelle, I told you the kid was
queer-eeAAAAHHHHH!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Damn it! The dog!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, put the dog in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, that was your father on the phone. He
lost his job.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How unlike him.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Watch your smart mouth. This means the end
of child support.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Which means…</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: You’ll have to start going to…</p>
<p>****: Oakland Public School.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Will you accept a collect call from Sheeni
Saunders?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni? How are you?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I’m well, Nickie.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And how is Trent? Not too suicidal I hope.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Of course, he was disconsolate, but we
talked all day and he’s come to see this as an opportunity for growth.
Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill
will.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nor I him. I wish him all the best.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: His parents are sending him to a French
speaking boarding school this year. He’s sure to get along there. So how
is my darling Albert?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, though he’s taken a disliking to
Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: And you, Nickie? How are you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I regret, Love of My Life, my father has lost
his job and I will now be forced to go to public school.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: How unfortunate. What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’s a writer - sort of. He writes advertising
copy.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Really? Nick, I suggest we look at your
father’s firing as a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I propose we get your father a job here in
Ukiah and you can come and live with him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Brilliant. Not that I’m fond of Ukiah, but I’d
live in a drainage culvert to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know
Progressive Plywood is looking for an assistant editor. It would be
perfect for your father.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I had no idea you had knowledge of the
employment opportunities of trade magazines.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: The owner is the father of a friend of
mine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Anyone I know?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Okay, it’s Trent’s father. So what?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So why would Trent want to help my father move
to Ukiah?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I told you, darling. Trent harbors you no
ill will. I will have him call your father up pretending to be a head
hunter.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Very well, but I don’t see how I am to live
with him. My mother values my indentured servitude.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: You must influence her to send you away. I
feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your
part.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I propose you rent the film Rebel Without a
Cause as soon as possible. You must emulate James Dean…</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: …You must be bad, Nickie. Be very, very
bad.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I will, darling. I will!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Kids? This is Officer Lance Wescott. He has
some bad news.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Your mother’s friend Jerry had a heart attack
in a bar in Dallas. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Will they be sending his belongings?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Uh… I’m afraid they’ve already been sent. To
his wife.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: His… His wife?!?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: There, there, Ma’am. It’s going to be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have decided to create a supplementary
persona named Fran�ois.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Like a Parisian James Dean, he will be bold,
reckless, contemptuous of authority, and irresistible to women.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Fran�ois. I think you’ll do nicely.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Oui, I am ze perfect match pour une
Francophile for ze likes of Sheeni Saunders. I have ze calculating
intelligence…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …the itchy trigger finger…</p>
<p><strong>nick fran�ois</strong>: …and cojone grandes! …and cojone
grandes!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Damn! Those hippos are taking a shower
together. How repulsive!</p>
<p><strong>albert’s pov</strong>: as we lunge at Lance’s crotch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where’s Joanie?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: She’s sleeping in.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No doubt. I don’t think anyone got a wink last
night with all that racket.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought there were laws in this city against
illicit cohabitation. Or are they just another big policeman’s joke?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Kid, you are asking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you going to do? Shoot me with your
gun?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: What the in God’s name has gotten into
you?!? Jerry paid good money for that trailer!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And just what makes you so sure it was me?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Who the hell else would write such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: And just how do you explain this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s Lacey.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: And just who the hell is Lacey?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dad’s girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: His girlfriend? What are you doing with a
picture like this of your father’s girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: C’mon, Mom, all boys his age have pictures
like that to…</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: When I want your opinion on raising my
child, I’ll ask for it.</p>
<p>****: And what’s this Lacey tart like?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, she likes fast cars and takes a lot of
naps with dad.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She likes to sit on Dad’s lap while he eats
and blow in his ear.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And she calls him “Thunder Rod” and he calls
her “Sugar Puss.”</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: You are confined to your room until school
starts, you sick pervert.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wish I was leaving with you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Your day will come. I never thought mine
would, but it did. Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made up?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wish. Did you really take a posture
class?</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Implants. I wanted them all my life.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, Lefty.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: What’s with your mom, Nick? She gave me the
third degree just to come up here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I vandalized Jerry’s trailer and she found my
picture of Lacey.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Well, good thing I stole this from the
bookstore then.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I was reading it all last night. Boy, having
sex is a lot more complicated than I thought. Did you know you were
supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You lie.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: No way, man. Here, I got the page marked.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, but I’m not sure I should try this on
Sheeni. I think this book is for people who’ve been married so long
they’re disgusted by the sight of each other.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Are we really supposed to be that… uh…
big?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think these illustrations are
disproportionate for emphasis.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Maybe we should compare.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Perhaps we should. Just for the sake of
research.</p>
<p><strong>perverts!</strong>: She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty
bolts. Nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him
around the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: You won’t get away! I’m calling your
parents! PERVERTS!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: In my house! How dare you!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, I just want you to know that I’ve
thought about it, and I’ve accepted that you are gay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks a pantsful, but I’m not gay. If you’re
really concerned though, I suggest you get me a room at the Ukiah Motel
6. If anyone can straighten me out, it’s Sheeni.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: That sounds more like a job for your
father. Here, he wants to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So what’s this I hear about you being
gay?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s this I hear about you being
unemployed?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, but my condition is only temporary. I
can change it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hope you do. We need the money.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nick, there are more important things in
life than money.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know, Dad. Like getting a good education.
And being able to respect your parents.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve got two words for you. Safe sex.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>latin kings were here.</strong>: SWISH TO… a pack of WIGGERS
as one of them gives the others a butterfly knife show-and-tell.</p>
<p><strong>female caseworker</strong>: Office of Child Welfare.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, uh… My name is Nick. Nick Twisp. My
father’s name is George Twisp.</p>
<p><strong>female caseworker</strong>: Has he hit you, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not lately. But he’s missed several child
support payments, and is not looking for work. So now I’m going to
public school in Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>female caseworker</strong>: Not the Oakland schools!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. And he’s had an offer from a respectable
publication in Ukiah.</p>
<p><strong>female caseworker</strong>: Don’t you worry, young man. I’ll
get right on this. Don’t worry. We’ll light a fire under that
deadbeat!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, Lefty. How’s it hangin’?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: You’ll never believe who called me, Nick.
Millie Filbert!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?!? Why?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I dunno. She just called and asked if I
wanted to hang out tonight. I didn’t want to ask why. I need to find
someplace for us to get it on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You can use my house if you want.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to a movie
and I’m planning on stealing Jerry’s trailer and torching it in a
parking lot, so you’ll have the whole house to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Right on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So where you headed anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Dr. Browerly’s office. My parents are making
me see a shrink now.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He asking lots of weird questions?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: You bet your left nut he is! He asked if I
had any lustful thoughts toward my sister.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I told him about beating off once with her
brassiere.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did you tell him that for?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: You don’t know what it’s like. I think they
release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sounds like a professional. He must be very
expensive.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I wouldn’t know. The bill goes to your
house.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My mom is paying for your therapy?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I guess so. It was your cyclops I was staring
at.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes, but it was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: That’s true. Gee, maybe I am gay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t be retarded. We were doing research for
our girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Oh, right. I forgot. That’s a relief. So
you’ll leave the door open?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, just don’t blow your load on my
sheets.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Thanks a pantsful, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t mention it. See ya, Lefty.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Lance and I are walking down to the movie
theater. There’s TV dinners in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your father
got a job in Ukiah.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom? Do you think it might be a good idea if I
moved in with him?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, that just wouldn’t work. I depend on
that child support money to eat.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But shouldn’t you depend on the child support
money for, you know… child support?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Watch your smart mouth.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The plan is simple.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tow Jerry’s trailer to a remote parking lot in
Berkeley and burn it to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thus evicting myself from my mother’s clutches
and into the arms of My One And Only Love.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fran�ois wanted to torch the trailer where it
sits, but I’ve convinced him a parking lot will reduce the risk of
collateral damage.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. lincoln - day</strong>: Nick hits the gas and the
Lincoln suddenly surges forward, released from the great weight. Nick
smiles. Behind him, through the rear window, the trailer can be seen
receding into the distance. He glances into the mirror and spots the
trailer plunging down the hill. Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in
front of him at the intersection. The gas tank on the Fiat cracks,
spurting fuel onto the pavement.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh no! I forgot to set the brake!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, Mom! How was the movie?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: You little shit. You stole your mother’s dead
ex-boyfriend’s trailer and set a five million dollar fire.</p>
<p><strong>nick/francois</strong>: I refuse to stand for such
allegations!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick! They have a description of the
arsonist!</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: A white teenage male, about five- seven. A
hundred and twenty five pounds, dark hair, spotted complexion…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That could be anyone.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: He was also wearing a tee shirt with the
words: I’m single, let’s mingle.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: What am I going to do? My only son will be
sent to prison!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Oh, Lance, can’t something be done?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Tell you what, Estelle. I’ll make out that
Nick reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire. It’ll be less
suspicious. But I could take some serious heat for this.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Oh, Lance! You’re wonderful! How can I
possibly repay you?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I’ll think of something, Estelle.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Now the kid better not be here when the
detectives start coming around. I’d send him away for a while. A long
while.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: He can go make his father’s life
miserable!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But I like it here.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: You’re going, buster!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: You’re son just burned down half of
Berkeley! Come and get the little brat!</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Wait a minute, Estelle, aren’t you going to
punish him? I’d say he deserves a good hiding.</p>
<p>****: He’s too much for me anymore. Can you do it, Lance,
darling?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t scream much. I am making a painful
sacrifice for The Woman Of My Dreams. My suffering possesses a beauty
which elevates it above this sordid scene.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you through?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Psst. Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I was wondering what happened to you. Did you
get to blow your wad?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: No. I did not get to blow my wad.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you get interrupted?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: No. Worse.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s worse than being interrupted?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Millie is a lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: The only reason she wanted to hang out with
me is because she heard that I showed you my slinky and thought I was
gay too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry, man. I didn’t have a great night
either.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Well, I dunno what you’re gonna do, but I’m
giving suicide serious consideration this time.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Or you could just fake it and then hide out in
Ukiah with me. Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink
you out of pity.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Hey, that’s not a bad idea. Thanks a
pantsful, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>bmw.</strong>: The driver’s side window rolls down to reveal
Nick’s dad. Lacey leans over George’s seat to wave at Nick through the
window and show him some of her cleavage.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Hiya, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is there any way I could sit up front with
Lacey, Dad? Mom’s boyfriend beat me pretty badly.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots get the
back seat.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw 325i - night</strong>: Nick is in the back, crowded
in by his belongings and Albert. They ride in tense silence until they
pass the sight of the fire, where FIRE FIGHTERS sift through the
ash.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My God. Look what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Go ahead and bring your stuff inside. Lacey
and I need a nap. C’mon, Sugar Puss.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What a competitive asshole.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: She most certainly is not. As a matter
of fact, we’ve banned you from her life, Nick Twisp.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: Trent Preston informed us that not
only were you moving here to pursue my daughter, but that you’re not
even mentally-handicapped, and thus molested my wife in the shower of
sound mind and body.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That rat-fink-fuck!</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: You watch your language. This is a
Christian home. We’re sending Sheeni to Les �cole des Arts and
Literatures in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Santa Cruz! But she’ll be miserable without
me. We’re in love.</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: Then I guess it’s a good thing Trent
is going there too. She’ll have someone to console her.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick! Oh, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I had to sneak away just to see you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s okay. I had to burn down half of
Berkley.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: That was you? Nick, are you out of your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I felt a grand gesture was required,
darling.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick, Trent betrayed us.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fran�ois will kill him later.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Who’s Fran�ois?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nevermind. The point is we must elope.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I don’t know, Nick. I do love you, but I
don’t want to spend the rest of our lives on the run.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s a small price to pay.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I… I can’t, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?!? But, Sheeni. I just don’t get it. I’m
here. Albert’s here too.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I know, Nick, and I’ve been longing for you
so. But we’ll just have to find another way. The car is already
packed.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick Twisp, I will not allow you to accept
defeat so easily!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Or we could consummate here in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Did you bring the consumer reports?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Then it will have to be Santa Cruz. I really
must go now, darling.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well… Goodbye, Sheeni. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I love you too. Squeeze darling Albert for
me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have endured a five million dollar beating
for nothing.</p>
<p>****: I have been stabbed. Stabbed in the back.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I do not have a friend within a hundred miles.
This is a daunting thought if you think about it.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Nick does his best to not be pinned by
DWAYNE CRAMPTON, who out-weighs him by at least 40 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Sorry `bout wompin’ ya. I’m Dwayne.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nick. Nick Twisp.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Say, Nick? Why do you suppose guys got only
two testicles when we got ten fingers and toes?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I could not begin to speculate.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, Nick. I’m Paul, Sheeni’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Paul. How did you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ve met.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No we haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In a previous life.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nice fire in Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did Sheeni tell you that was me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why? Was I an arsonist in a previous life?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. But Sheeni was.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My God. What did she burn?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Men. Men and boys.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My God, Fran�ois! What was Paul smoking?</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: Shut up and go with it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the… What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Is..? Is that my bra?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’re calling that fruitcake display strike
one. Two more strikes and it’s back to Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Hey, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Uh… Hi, Dwayne. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Ain’t ya heard. We’re gonna be roommates!
Ain’t that zinky?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crampton</strong>: Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here
and take yer sleepin’ pill. You must be Nick. Wash yer hands, boy. I
don’t serve two shifts.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Uh… Dad? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mrs. Crampton’s our new housekeeper. I’m
renting out the spare room to her seeing as her camper has been deemed
unfit for human habitation.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about Dwayne?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s bunking with you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You working on strike two?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed with me?
It’ll be tons warmer.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No thank you, Dwayne.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: This came for you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Is it a love letter, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know, it’s in French. Say, why does
your mother give you sleeping pills?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: `Cuz otherwise I’d stay up all night playin’
Nintendo Wii. Say, Nick, can I walk Albert?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know. Dogs don’t grow on trees.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Pleeease, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. But it will cost you one sleeping pill
per walk.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Whatchu want them pills for, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You never know when sedatives will come in
handy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lefty?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Oh. Hey, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lefty, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I live here. The guy’s only charging me fifty
in cash a month.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I mean, what are you doing in town?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I did what you told me, Nick. I threw my
backpack off the pier and reported my own suicide. I even left a
note.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wow, Lefty, I’m kinda impressed. Faking your
suicide is pretty ballsy.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: So where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Redwood High School.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Can I come?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why would you want to go to school if you
didn’t have to?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: It’s weird, Nick, but school seems like a
pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and
homework.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I can see this stunt really has liberated your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I’m telling you, Nick: killing myself was the
best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: May I sit at your table?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Sure. I’m Lefty and this is Nick.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I am Vijay Joshi.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I see you both have been rejected by the
socially elite of our school. Ukiah is a cultural wasteland compared to
India. Though some of the girls are very attractive.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you have a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: Not at the moment. But I am optimistic. How
about you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes, but she transferred.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: You don’t mean Sheeni Saunders. I heard she
was interested in some brilliant fellow in the Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Hey, that’s you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I’m surprised. You are not at all what I
imagined.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: So how is Sheeni?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know. She sent me this letter. But
it’s in French.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: Shall I translate it for you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You speak French?</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I speak French, English, Hindi, Marathi, and
Urdu.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: That must come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: Dear, Nick…</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: …I am writing you from my room in Santa
Cruz. Surprisingly, boarding school has proven to be a welcome
liberation as well as…</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: …a stimulating experience which I am now not
so quick to change.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Perhaps you should consider learning French
and enrolling. That said…</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: …English cannot be spoken on campus even if
you are hemorrhaging from an accidental limb amputation.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I have made friends with the head of the
girls’ basketball team. Her name is Heather, and despite her popularity,
she is saving herself for college boys.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I have an interesting roommate from New York
named Taggarty…</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: She has already slept with seventeen boys
and hopes to rack up fifty before leaving here.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Trent has taken up windsurfing and has been
designated target number one by all the girls. I am still very angry at
him for the betrayal but he claims he wants to mend our friendship.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I guess we shall see.</p>
<p>****: All in all, I’m happy and look forward to further growth in
this rich, intellectual environment.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s it? Nothing else about me?</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: Oh yes… Love to you and Albert. Who’s
Albert?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Albert is our dog. This is a disaster. What
the hell does she mean Trent wants to mend the relationship?</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I don’t know, but this Taggarty girl sounds
very uninhibited. I wonder if she’s made it with a Hindu yet.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Heather sounds like a babe. You think if I
grew a beard I’d pass for college age?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve got to get to Sheeni as soon as possible.
If I don’t Trent Preston is going to mindfuck her into thinking she
doesn’t like me.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: And then he’ll probably fuck her in other
ways. Did you know you’re supposed to put your pinkie in a girl’s
bumhole, Vijay?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Will you shut up and help me out?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Sorry, Nick. What should we do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I suggest we steal my father’s BMW and take a
trip to Santa Cruz. Vijay, you’ll have to be our translator.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: But what will we tell our parents?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: You can tell your father you are staying at
Nick’s house for the weekend. And visa versa.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Good thinking.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: But what if we are caught?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: To hell with it, Vijay. It’s time to take
action!</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw 325i - day</strong>: As Vijay drives, Lefty holds up
a road map in the back seat. Nick places a CD in the stereo and TAKE
FIVE fills the car.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: What is this music, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s Dave Brubeck. I thought a person as
cultured as yourself would appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: You want culture? I will give you
culture.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nickie?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Sheeni. Hi, I’m Nick.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: Oh. So you’re Nick.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We’ve heard so much about you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And this is Vijay. And this is Lefty. Lefty
goes to USC.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: And I’m not gay.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick, I knew you’d come!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: …but you must wait in the car until we can
sneak you in.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Lefty, should maybe sleep in my room. It’s
pretty crowded in here.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Your roommate won’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, Darlene went home for the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Well, see you guys in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Pardon me, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>wall of taggarty’s conquests</strong>: a series of mug shots
of sullen-looking TEENAGE BOYS. Most of them have been given a grade of
C- or below.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s your competition.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: A distinguished group I would be happy to
join.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I am in a state of sexual frenzy. What is
your plan?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We drape a blanket over the lower bunk for
Sheeni and me. You tackle Taggarty on the top bunk. Here’s a condom. I
slipped two to Lefty, leaving us with four.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: What if they don’t go for it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They’ll go for it. You can cut the sexual
tension in that room with a knife.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Don’t be silly, darling. Not with others in
the room. We must wait until everyone falls asleep.</p>
<p><strong>taggerty</strong>: Goodnight boys. Do you need the light on
to take off your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. We can find our zippers in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was that the matron?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then who was it?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: It was Trent.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you say it was Trent?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes. He came to discuss our friendship. I
told him now was not the time.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So where is Trent now?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I assume he went back to the boys’ dorm. Now
really, Nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Now is our chance.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Chance for what?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: To confront our nemesis. We must go to the
boys’ dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I suppose we should at least get a look at
him. To see what we’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p>****: You see what we are dealing with… and zen I wll deal wiz
it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Trent?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I am Nick Twisp.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, so you’re Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is Trent here?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You just missed him, Nick. He just grabbed a
couple condoms and left.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did he say where he was going?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I think he said he was going to Heather’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But that’s where Lefty is. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent’s roommate.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, so you’re Ed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nothing. It’s just that Sheeni mentioned Trent
has a thing for a guy named Ed, and that he touches the guy when he
falls asleep. But obviously if that were you, you’d know about it. Must
be a different Ed Solomon. Take care now.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s up, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is Trent in there?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What happened to Lefty?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I’m right here, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Trent was here, but he left. He only
dropped by to lend us a couple more condoms.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But I gave Lefty two already.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes, and that was very generous of you, but
the night is young.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So what is Trent, the fucking condom
faerie!?!</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: You can have one of ours, Nick. If you need
one.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So where did he say he was going?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He didn’t say, but I’m pretty sure I just
saw him go into our bathroom down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks. Oh, and I’d be careful with those
condoms. Trent’s roommate Ed said that Trent pokes holes in them so that
he can get Sheeni pregnant and be with her forever.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m Sheeni’s friend, Nick. Sorry to disturb
you.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: That’s OK. It was something I ate. So wait,
are you Sheeni’s boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: My name’s Bernice. Bernice Lynch. Not that
you asked.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually, I think
Trent Preston mentioned you. He said you were frumpy, but now that I’ve
met you, I can see Trent is a lying bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Thanks. And Trent can go to hell for all I
care. Sheeni too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You don’t like Sheeni?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Personally, I hate her guts. Well, pardon
me, Nick. I feel like throwing up some more now.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You didn’t happen to see Trent Preston did
you?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I did actually. I think he was on his way
to Sheeni’s room.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes, darling.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was Trent here?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: But I sent him away again.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Because I want you, darling. Not even Trent
can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued
me.</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: Q’est que c’est passer ici?!?</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw 325i - night</strong>: Lefty lets out a holler of
joy.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I did it three times! Two long ones and a
quickie.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Great. Just great. How about you, Vijay?</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: It was difficult to tell with that condom,
Nick. Why did you buy such thick ones?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That brand was top-rated by Consumers.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: Well, she’s safe. No organism could penetrate
those walls.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You think the girls are in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: They will likely notify their parents.
Perhaps even expel them.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s it! Expel them. Then Sheeni will have
to come back to Ukiah.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: What will we do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, we can’t stay in the car. Sooner or
later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for our non-existent
driver’s license.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: But we have no money!</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I have no shoes! I’ll catch pneumonia and die
a indeterminate proto-quasi-virgin!</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom? It’s Nick. I’m sorry to wake you, but I’m
hoping you’ll help your only son. Especially seeing as it would really
piss off Dad.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Where are you, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>pov truck driver</strong>: Nick waving frantically in nothing
but tightie-whities. The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door
opens to reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot
tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down at our three
waylaid adventurers.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Pardon me. But is one of you Nick Twisp?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. I’m Nick.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I’m Wally. I’m a friend of your mom’s.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: So, uhm, uh… Your mom says you need a ride.
Did I mention I’m a friend?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Wally was a friend of Jerry’s. He came to
help me in my time of mourning.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What happened to Lance?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Lance is busy training to be a detective.
He isn’t around as much as he used to be.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him a
question, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous actress was
married to Frank Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey Rooney?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Whoever she is, she sure gets around.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Ava Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: That’s nothing. You should see what he did
with the living room.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Go ahead, Wally. Show them.</p>
<p><strong>nick, lefty, vijay</strong>: Ooooooh.</p>
<p><strong>nick, lefty, vijay</strong>: Aaaaaaah.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Well, uhm… It was nice meeting you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You too, Mr. Rumpkin.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where’s Dad?</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: In the bedroom. I wouldn’t bother him, Nick.
He’s in a foul mood. He’s on with the police. Apparently someone broke
in and stole his Beamer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lacey! Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Nick, you got a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: If you asked your girlfriend as a favor,
would she do it with me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Guys don’t share their girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I get ya. You’re worried `cause your
girlfriend might get knocked up. What if I pull out, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: It’s not my fault, you tight-assed, critical,
nonfeeling, sexist drunk.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sticks and stones. It doesn’t bother me if
you sleep on the couch from now on.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Does it bother you that you’re a selfish,
uptight, boring lover?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You forgot lousy driver!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s strike two, jerkoff!</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p>****: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: They found your car in Davenport, George. Go
pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look who’s wearing the pants this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Nick, I feel for you. It must be tough being
a teenager in this house.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My mother wasn’t any better.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Your mom has had a difficult time. She has
had a great deal to put up with. I’m starting to appreciate that
now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you by any chance referring to me?</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: If the shoe fits, suck on it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ll see who’s sucking on what soon.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: I spoke with Taggarty this morning. She
requested a wallet sized photo.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Congratulations, Vijay. That makes it
official. Welcome to the club.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What grade did you receive?</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: A C+. Which I feel is perfectly satisfactory
given the conditions.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: I guess this means they’re not being
expelled.</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: No, apparently they convinced the matron it
was all quite innocent.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you kidding? She had her flashlight
trained on your Hindi boner!</p>
<p><strong>vijay</strong>: No need to be jealous, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If I’m to get Sheeni expelled and sent back to
me I will need a partner in crime.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Luckily, Fran�ois has a girl on the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting you this
weekend in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I just want you to know I now see why you
loath Sheeni Saunders so strongly.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I too have come to despise the snooty,
pretentious brunette and in all honesty you should probably get her
expelled. I am happy to help in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have included a number of sleeping pills
with this note.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You must introduce one of these into her
breakfast beverage each day.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She may be intelligent, but she is not likely
to pass her courses when she’s falling asleep in class.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Since meeting you, I have come to realize my
interest in Sheeni was only a transient adolescent infatuation. I like
you more than I can say. Take courage. Together we will outsmart these
cake eaters.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Affectionately yours, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: P.S. Please destroy this note immediately.</p>
<p><strong>on a mailbox</strong>: As Nick deposits his letter.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where’s Dad?</p>
<p>****: Daddy is in Davenport. Where you left his car.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We saved you some mushrooms, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>on the book</strong>: as the nude figures suddenly BECOME
ANIMATED, making wonderful love. Nick follows them with his eyes as they
float off the page.</p>
<p><strong>the hall</strong>: and into…</p>
<p><strong>the living room</strong>: where Lacey watches Paul blow on
his trumpet. Nick marvels. The phone rings.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Nick? Get the phone?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw 325i - night</strong>: George cradles the cell
phone. WE INTERCUT.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nick? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a breathing
organism.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Quit fooling around, Nick. This is your dad.
Is everything okay there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t be afraid, Dad. Everything will be okay.
You deserve to be loved.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the hell is that supposed to mean? Is
Lacey there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lacey is here. Paul is caressing her toes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Paul! Who the hell is Paul?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Paul is our friend. He makes beautiful music
for the acrobats. They’re naked.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who’s naked? Is Lacey naked?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t be afraid, Dad. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dad is afraid.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: He is on the wrong path. I have felt that for
some time.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: where Paul stands between George and
Lacey.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay, George, just calm down.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You are in serious trouble. You’ve assaulted
me and I know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my
son. That child is only twelve years old.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m sixteen, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Shut your pie hole!</p>
<p>****: That boy is an underaged minor. I’m going to have you arrested
and charged with child molesting.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Don’t be an idiot, George. No one was
naked.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: When you get out of prison, you will both
have to register as sex offenders. You will never be able to get a
decent job again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve never had a decent job. I don’t think I’d
want one.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Let’s go, Paul. George, I’ll pick up the rest
of my things tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not until you pay me the rest of the money
you owe.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: I paid you all your money!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not the extra charges.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Using bad language in front of a minor. The
judge will hear about that too.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What’s all the ruckus about?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dwayne! Please cover yourself.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You wanna play Nintendo all night?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Of course not. I’m tired. Let’s go to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A strange night. I dreamed of wrestling for
what seemed like hours with an amorous walrus…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There is only one explanation: I have been
Dwayned.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wake up! I know what you were doing last
night, you disgusting beast!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Don’t be mad, Nick. I like you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crampton</strong>: Boys, time to get– AHH! Dwayne!
Where’s yer pajamas?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Nick made me take them off, Mom. He took off
his too.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crampton</strong>: You leave my son alone. Don’t go
co’rupt him with yer nastiness!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We weren’t doing anything, Mrs. Crampton. It
was just hot last night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crampton</strong>: If you get hot, boys, open a window.
Don’t go takin’ off yer pajamas. That’s nasty.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: Bonjour.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Taggarty? It’s Nick.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to talk to
Sheeni.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If you please.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: It’s your would-be-lover.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, My Beloved. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Not so well. I have been afflicted with some
kind of chronic fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Perhaps you are home sick. You do sound rather
blue.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I’m not home sick, Nick. In fact, I’m not
very happy with you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Me? What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: You know damn well, Nick. You’ve been
spreading rumors about Trent. And he doesn’t deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Doesn’t deserve it!?! I’d have to claim he has
genital warts to sink to his level.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, whatever you said to Ed Solomon, it
was enough to get him to give Trent a black eye.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni, I just don’t get it. This guy has
cock-blocked at every turn and you’re taking his side?!?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Cock-blocked?</p>
<p>****: We’ll have to resume this another time, Nick. It’s been an
emotionally exhausting weekend. My parents are in an uproar over Paul.
He’s moved some floozie in with him up in the studio over the
garage.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lacey’s not a floozie.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Lacey? You know her?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Of course. She’s my father’s ex- girlfriend. I
think that might make you my stepmother-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick. Don’t be gross.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry. At any rate, I’ll let you go. We’ll
have plenty of time to settle this tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I’ll be coming for
dinner, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Don’t even think it, Nick. You know my
parents don’t approve of you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m confident they will learn to love me.
After all, I’m practically family.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick, you must dismiss this Thanksgiving
notion from your mind. I remain firm on this issue. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t move, blubber boy, I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. george’s manufactured home - day</strong>: A POLICE
OFFICER stands on the steps. Nick goes wide eyed at the sight of him and
visibly slumps.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Is George Twisp in?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Uh, I’m pretty sure he’s sleeping off a
hangover, Officer. Is he under arrest?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Under arrest? No, I’m the officer
working the case of his stolen car.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You can tell your pop that the CD he
found in his car is Ravi Shankar.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Indian music. So we’re a checkin’
the INS files, see if we can get some prints that match. You wouldn’t
know anyone who might have stolen the car who listens to this crap,
would ya, son?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, and I’m not sure I like the implication.
Ravi Shankar is beloved by many Caucasian…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What about Vijay Joshi?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I’m pretty sure he’s Injun.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Vijay Joshi. We’ll look into it.
Thank you, boys.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mrs. Crampton complained to Dad that I tried
to corrupt the fat pervert cohabitating with me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He has deemed it strike three, but is only
banishing me as far as Mrs. Crampton’s condemned trailer.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No matter. Tomorrow I will be reunited with My
Everlasting Love. And I will not be stopped. Not by an outbreak of the
plague, nor by a cruel return of the ice-age. Not even by the Gods
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: where the phone RINGS. He flips off the
stereo with the remote and snatches up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Twisp residence.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh. Hey, Mom. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nickie, I have some bad news!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. I’m ready. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: I’m afraid Lance and Wally got into a
terrible row. He tried to arrest Wally and Wally broke Lance’s jaw.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s the bad news?</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: The Berkeley police know you started the
fire. Lance told them where you are.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Nick, they’re coming to arrest you!</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Nick, haven’t you heard? Vijay’s been
arrested.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Arrested?!?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: For grand theft auto. They found his prints
in your father’s car.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s terrible. Did he go quietly?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: No. He said you were his accomplice and now
the Ukiah police are looking for you!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The day has proven to be a disaster. Where did
I gone wrong? I have a decision to make.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I could hit the road and spend my life a
fugitive with my integrity nearly intact.</p>
<p><strong>under the bridge</strong>: Nick squats in the shadows. He’s
holding a bouquet of municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head
with his tie.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s that or risk incarceration to keep my
dinner date.</p>
<p>****: Obviously the answer is clear.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello, Nick. Right on time. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: What interesting flowers, Nick. Who are they
for?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Uh, Mrs. Saunders.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, you remember Nick
Twisp, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: You are very, very tall.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No he’s not, Dad. He just appears tall because
you are on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: I can feel the floor pushing against
me. Can you feel it too, tall youth?</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Paul served an appetizer earlier.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, it’s a recipe I picked up in the
Southwest. Stuffed mushrooms.</p>
<p><strong>taggerty</strong>: Hello, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>taggerty</strong>: How is the star-crossed persistent
lover?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay, I guess. Where’s Sheeni?</p>
<p><strong>taggerty</strong>: Upstairs, Nick. She saw you coming and hid
in her room.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dinner is almost ready, My Love.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I do not intend to be party to my brother’s
absurdities. He has allowed you in and drugged my parents.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think they are deriving some good from the
experience.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: What are you doing here, Nick? I expressly
asked you not to come.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: To hell with that. What do I have to do to
prove my love to you? My friends have gotten laid and I’m pretty sure
neither one of them was beaten with a tree trunk, raped by a walrus, or
had to contend with the likes of Trent Preston!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: You were raped by a walrus?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni, I have shown restraint, I have
committed crimes, I have traveled to the lengths of the state and still
you won’t give me this one little thing.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Sex, Nick. Why don’t you just say it? That’s
what you want. You want me to have sex with you.</p>
<p>****: Well… YEAH!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: How is my dog?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Excellent. He should be coming out of the oven
right about now.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I hate you, Nickie!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hate you too.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Dear Lord…</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Dear Lord, thank you for this bounty. Help us
to be tolerant of others - especially the boyfriends and girlfriends of
our immediate relations. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. saunders</strong>: Paul? Your father looks rather
strange.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel
movement.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. saunders</strong>: That’s no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: The food is delicious, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>****: Sister, darling, how long has it been since we all observed the
rituals of Thanksgiving?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Not long enough, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hope it’s the first of many such occasions
for me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. saunders</strong>: Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/
Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright…</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Round yon virgin Mother and Child/ Holy
infant so tender and mild/ Sleep in heavenly peace… Sle-eep in heavenly
pee-eace.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: Oh, Trent, you made it.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Trent, darling, this is Nick.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Nick, at last we meet.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Trent.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: Have a seat, Trent.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I’m sorry, Taggarty, I can’t stay. I have bad
news.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Bernice Lynch has tried to commit
suicide.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: She swallowed a number of sleeping pills, and
is now in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: The poor girl.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: There’s more. Before I left school, I
searched her room.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you obtain proper authorization from the
officials?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: No, Nick, I acted on my own initiative. In
Bernice’s closet, I found this letter.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: In the letter, the writer instructed Bernice
to begin sedating Sheeni with drugs he himself supplied.</p>
<p><strong>taggarty</strong>: Nick, you didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, you see…</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Nick! You could have killed me!</p>
<p><strong>mr. saunders</strong>: Who died?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: No one yet, Mr. Saunders.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I can’t arrest him. But I have called the
Santa Cruz Police. They are on their way here now.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, I shall be going now. Please continue
without me.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Nick, I suggest you remain here and face the
consequences like a man.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you for that unsolicited counsel, Trent.
And please, do drop dead.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Goodbye, Sheeni. I did it all for you.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: You are completely contemptible, Nick Twisp.
I never wish to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here I am, reviled by friends and family.
Relentlessly pursued by three police jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fron�ois suggests we flee the country. But
where to go? Mexico? Canada? India, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Uh, Hi, Joanie. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Since my sister can see through me, I’m
obliged to give a relatively candid and thorough review of the
events.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Nick, six months ago you were just another
brownnosing honor student. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not really sure. I fell in love with
Sheeni. All I want is to be with her. The rest is all a big
misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Nick, you’ve stolen, vandalized, trespassed,
and burned down Berkeley. All for one girl. If there’s a
misunderstanding, it’s with your insight into females.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But… But where did I go wrong?</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Nick, boys your age are always looking for
the path of least resistance to becoming a man. A boy’s whole
self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So far, I agree.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: Sooner or later what those boys realize, is
that the girls you’re chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops
they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: So I guess what you should ask yourself is:
How far are you willing to go?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All the way, Joanie. I’m willing to go all the
way.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: You can stay here a couple days, but
eventually they’ll come looking for you. I don’t have much money to give
you, but here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks, Joanie. I… Uh… I love you.</p>
<p><strong>joanie</strong>: I love you too, you little brat.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: One ticket to Ukiah, please.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, bacon boy, it’s Nick.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Nick, ya little prick, where are ya?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re on a need to know basis, gorilla
boy.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: No matter, they’ll get you eventually.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let me make it easy. I’ll be at Redwood High
School tomorrow morning. Round up your donut dipping friends. I’m
turning myself in.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bus - day</strong>: Nick sits by the window, the
suitcase on the seat next to him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lefty?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Nick? What are you doing here? Everyone and
their mother’s mother is looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They have me soon enough. Where are you
going?</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Home. I’m done being dead, Nick. Heather and
I are going back to Oakland for Christmas. You should have heard how
glad my parents were that I didn’t kill myself. They were even happier
when they found out I’m not gay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s great, Lefty.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: Yeah, being in love is pretty great. So
what’s your plan, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Welcome back, Nick. We had a feeling you were
coming.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Paul and Lacey are kind enough to share some
leftover fungi to help calm my nerves. That, combined with yet another
viewing of James Dean’s performance is what gives me my final burst of
inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fran�ois of course wants no part of this, and
demands that we make a run for the border. But I have decided to veto
him. It’s time to face the music.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: This is Tina Manion reporting live at Redwood
High in Ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the FBI awaits the
promised arrival of Nick Twisp.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey. That’s my car!</p>
<p><strong>nick’s pov</strong>: of the parking lot below, which looks
like the kind of turn out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel.</p>
<p><strong>on the various faces of the crowd</strong>: staring up in
silence. Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne, George, Lacey, Paul… Nick
gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity. The parking lot erupts
with CHEERS of his name. A few Berkeley KIDS hold up a sign that reads
I’M SINGLE, LET’S</p>
<p><strong>mingle.</strong>: Then - shouts of warning from the
megaphones. And as the flashers and sirens come to life, Nick jumps back
into his father’s car and peels out.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw 325i - day</strong>: Nick glances in the rear view
mirror as the cops bear through the cloud kicked up in his wake.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw 325i - day</strong>: He yanks the wheel hard and
veers off onto the mountain road. A few of the squad cars miss the turn
and skid side-long through a picket fence. Nick takes the switchbacks at
60 per, wheels practically sliding off the turns.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw 325i - day</strong>: As Nick watches the quickly
approaching cliffs edge, he undoes his seat belt. He goes for the door
handle, eyes going wide when he finds power lock has engaged.</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: The BMW descends toward us in a storm of
air bubbles. As it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake, a
somber TRUMPET SOLO comes in pre-lap and we are…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My only comfort regarding my untimely death is
knowing my friends and family will do just fine without me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: As it would turn out Heather’s vaginal canal
is slightly misshapen…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …and thus completely compatible with Lefty’s
otherwise incongruent penis.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: A little to the right… a little… RIGHT
THERE! RIGHT THERE!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Vijay would eventually manage to pin the car
theft on me. But had lost the attention of Taggarty forever. Who by the
way…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …never would find her perfect A.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And would therefore start grading on a
curve.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Joanie of course would get to continue to
travel the world…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …and she and her breasts would probably go on
to have the wonderful life that they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wally as it turns out…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …would go on Jeopardy and win, ensuring my
mother’s blessed rise to a higher economic status.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …my father, no longer burdened with crippling
child support payments, would now be able to afford the model BMW he
always wanted…</p>
<p><strong>i/e. bmw m6smg - moving - flashforward - day</strong>: Dwayne
sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as his flab flaps in
the wind.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …and would come to find the surrogate son he
always wanted in Dwayne, the only organism alive that could possibly
appreciate George’s driving.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Leaving just one last piece of business.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Excuse me. Are you a friend of Nick’s?</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: A terribly old friend. Carlotta
Ulanksy. I’m sorry for your loss.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: You shouldn’t be, Carlotta. I am no doubt
culpable for Nick’s actions.</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: Well, love does compel us to
desperate acts. People cannot always act rationally.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a way of
making me feel worthy of the pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: My dear, if there’s one thing the
demise of Nick Twisp has taught me, it’s that self worth comes from
within.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Would you like to stay the night, Carlotta?
We can reminisce of our departed.</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: Oh, my. A kind offer, but I really
must…</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: It’s just… I don’t think I could bear to be
alone tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: Goodness. What an attractive
negligee.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Do you like it? I bought it in Santa Rosa
last fall. I had hoped to wear it for Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: Oh, darling, I’m sure he would have
found it most… Appealing.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I like lying here with you, Carlotta.</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I can’t think of anyone I’d rather lie here
with.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Except maybe Nick. If Nick were here, what
do you suppose he would do to me?</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: Make love to you I would think.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Then why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick/carlotta</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Take off that silly wig and make love to
me!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni! You knew!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Of course, Nick. Did you really expect to
fool your soul mate with such a disguise?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Take me darling!</p>
<p><strong>las vegas of the body</strong>: Into the NICK’S PENIS
nightclub where champagne bottles POP with the ringing in of a new era,
and the Leopards ROAR, and the stage erupts with fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: My parents are at services. They won’t be
back for hours.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Shall we have breakfast, my love?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: What a lovely notion, darling. You go ahead
downstairs and get things started.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Calling Taggarty to report that you are not
completely incompetent in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do I get to stay and hear my grade?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Not a chance, Mr. Twisp. Such things are
reserved for girl talk only. And for good reason.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Very well, Sheeni. Don’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, good morning, Fran�ois. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: What do I sink? I sink now’s are chance to
run for ze hills.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Nick, we are young, yes? Is the world not
our oyster? Beaucoup des filles. Do you not want to know what it is like
to make love to another girl?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I do, but… We’ve come so far. What about
Sheeni?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Forget Sheeni. Yes, she will always be ze
first conquest, but all zis time you saught zis was ze end, ze one and
only, when in fact it is only ze beginning.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sheeni, the police are here!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Quick! Maybe I can sneak out the back!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t understand. How do they even know I’m
alive?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Well, I called them of course.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, thanks a pantsful!</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: But, Nickie, it had to be done.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But… but why?</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: I can’t very well marry a wanted man, honey.
Look at it this way, in a few months you’ll be a free man and we can be
together in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: You might as well break it to her now,
Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fran�ois is right of course, but on the other
hand, why be cruel? After all, Sheeni had managed to give me hope every
step of the way. And if hope is what Sheeni would now need to go on,
well then…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: As always, you are right, my love.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Merd.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Arrested? Ha. It may not appear so, but the
truth is… I’ve got the world on a string.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: Write often, Nickie.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I will, darling.</p>
<p><strong>sheeni</strong>: And don’t worry about Albert. He’ll be
waiting for you too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: As Fran�ois would remind me, I’m intelligent,
healthy, virile, not violently ugly… On the whole I am splendidly
equipped for this great adventure we call the human existence.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Besides, what jury would convict a teenager
who acted out of love? And even if I do get to spend the next few months
of my youth getting Dwayned by the inmates of the California Juvenile
Correctional System, I did get my thirty two minutes of lovemaking with
one of the most outstanding girls of this or any other epoch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But was it all worth it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You bet your left nut it was.</p>
