<h1 id="antz">antz</h1>
<p><strong>z</strong>: All my life, I’ve lived and worked in the big
city…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: …which is kind of a problem, since I’ve always
felt uncomfortably in crowds.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I feel…isolated. Different. I’ve got abandonment
issues. My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn’t
have much time for me…when you have five million siblings, it’s
difficult to get attention. I feel physically inadequate – I’ve never
been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. Sometimes I think
I’m just not cut out to be a worker. But I don’t have any other options.
I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub. The whole system
just…makes me feel…insignificant.</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: Terrific! You should feel
insignificant!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: …I should?</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: YES!!! You know, people ask
me, “Doctor, why are you always happy?” And I tell them it’s mind over
matter. I don’t mind that I don’t matter! Do you get it? Do you get
it?</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: Z, we’re part of the
fastest growing species in the whole world!</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: Ask me why we’re so
successful.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Why are we so successful?</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: I’m glad you asked me that
question!</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: What do you see out
there?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: …Ants…</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: Right! Ants! Millions of
creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: You see? Being an ant is
being able to say, “Hey – I’m meaningless, you’re meaningless.”</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: But – but I’ve always felt life was about finding
meaning…and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: Z…you need help. Whoops!
We’re gonna have to stop there. Your minute is up!</p>
<p><strong>motivational counsellor</strong>: Now back to work! We’ve
made real progress! Remember – let’s be best superorganism we can
be!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Hello?! Earth to Z! You better snap out of
it, or there’s gonna be a lot of pissed off ants!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Sorry Azteca. Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!
Alley oop! Shouldn’t we be wearing gloves? I mean this dirt is
very…dirty. Doesn’t anyone think of hygiene? Boy am I hungry. I’m so
hungry I’m seeing double. It looks like there’s two million ants in
here. When’s lunch? Tomorrow, or the day after?</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Z, old pal… SHUT UP!!! It’s bad enough
there’s a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: The squeaky wheel gets the oil.</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: No, Z. The squeaky wheel gets thrown away,
alright? You’re a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear-
segment. I don’t wanna see anything happen to you. So quit mouthing off,
before you get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Thank goodness. Breaktime.</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Break’s over.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in
the ground. Why are we even digging this thing?</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig.
We’re not the ones in charge.</p>
<p><strong>general formica</strong>: Cut the chit-chat down there! We’ve
spoiled these workers, Carpenter. They’ve never had it so good, and
listen to them – always grumbling and complaining…</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: …Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general formica</strong>: What have they got to complain
about? Three square meals a day…</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Actually, sir, we’ve cut them down to
three roughly rectangular meals a week.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Don’t give me statistics, Carpenter. I know
what I’m talking about. DOORS!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Oil that, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Ah! General Formica.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: General, the severe food shortage that faces
the colony…pains me. The thought of any of my children going hungry…
Who’s the cutest widdle worker? You are! Yes, you! Don’t forget to brush
your teeth! Ship ’er out. What steps are you taking to remedy the
situation?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: We are launching a major offensive to
expand our foraging territory…</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Yes, what else?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Please don’t worry, your majesty. Leave the
worrying to me. As you know, I’m not an ant of half- measures. I don’t
pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise
you it’s being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: No snacking between meals! Off you go! Now –
what were we saying?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that
be all?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man!
I don’t know what we would do without you.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: General Formica!</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Princess Bala, sir. Your fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Princess! You look – outstanding. Is there
anything I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Well – I thought – since we’re getting
married…it might be nice if we…got to know one another.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Bala has always been a hopeless romantic,
General.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: It’s just that – well, I’m honored that you
selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a
little more smoothly if – we had a conversation?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Conversation…yes…well… Wasn’t she
briefed?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Look, General! A darling baby soldier! Don’t
try to be a hero! Just make sure you come back in one piece! Next!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: I’ll take your suggestion under advisement,
Princess. In the meanwhile –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: General – we have to talk sometime!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Very well. Carpenter, is there a convenient
time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Actually, sir, we’re ahead of schedule.
We have thirty-six seconds available right now.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Outstanding. Princess…?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: So, um…how was your day? What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Well… I declared war!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Oh…and I was afraid we had nothing in
common…</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Duty calls!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: No squeak. Outstanding!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: I felt the same way before I got married.
Confused. Scared.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Yes – but I did my duty and sorted out all
those messy feelings. The wonderful thing about ant life is that
everything is arranged. Even marriage. You’re lucky – General Formica is
a paragon of anthood.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Yes…he’s wonderful…</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #1</strong>: The General’s body segments are
so…symmetrical.</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #2</strong>: I’d let him order me into battle
anyday.</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #1</strong>: Princess? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Wrong? How could anything be wrong? I’m going
to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies,
just like my mom. Do I look fat to you?</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #2</strong>: Pre-wedding jitters.</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #1</strong>: You just need to blow off some steam.
Let’s go to the bar at the Royal Club!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: The Club’s so stuffy. I want to try someplace
different.</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #2</strong>: There isn’t anyplace else – Except
the worker bar.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: The worker bar! Yes! That’s where I want to
go!</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #1</strong>: But – we can’t – there’ll be workers
there.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: We declared war again? Are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>aphids</strong>: Ouch! Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Two aphid beers.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Did you see that? How he gave you the beers, not
me? I’m telling you, he’s got something against workers.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about,
Z.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Come on – everybody dumps on us workers. You
soldiers get all the glory. Plus you get to go out into the world, meet
interesting insects, and kill them.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Yeah, but you get to spend all day with
those fabulous worker babes.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Weaver, they’re career girls. They’re obsessed
with digging. No, I’ll probably never meet the girl for me.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Who said there was a girl for you? I was
talking about a girl for me. Don’t you want your aphid beer?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I can’t help it. I have a thing about drinking
from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Z, we’ve known each other a long time,
right?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Of course. You were born two seconds after
me.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: And all the time I’ve known you, you’ve been
grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves. Go with the
flow.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Weaver, I’m an insect, not a liquid.</p>
<p><strong>drunk scout</strong>: Have you been to Insectopia? Have you?
No, ya goddam larvas! But I have… …Mosquitos n’ caterpillars n’ beetles
– all livin’ in peace, stuffin their guts with food…No rules, no
regulations…you can be your own ant there… It’s Insectopia!
Insectopia!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hey, Weaver, listen!</p>
<p><strong>drunk scout</strong>: I was cut off from my unit – found it
by mistake – It changed my life! You see – ya follow the great yellow
egg, and you come to the land of red and white –</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: You’ve had enough for one night! Come on,
Gramps, before you get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hey, did you hear what he said?!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Poor guy’s had one too many scouting
missions.</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #2</strong>: We shouldn’t be doing this – it isn’t
proper!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’m the Princess, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #2</strong>: Of course –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: And do Princesses do improper things?</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #2</strong>: Of course not –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn’t
improper. Anyway, don’t worry. No one will recognize us in our
disguises.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’m just a common worker, cooling off after a
rough day!</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Okay, folks. It’s six-fifteen, and that
means it’s time to dance.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Time to cut a rug, Z!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I’m not in the mood. Even when they’re off work,
they follow orders.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Well, you just sit here and be a
party-pooper.</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: And a left-right-quarterstep-back
step-halfstep – a left-right- quarterstep-backstep-halfstep – a
left-right-quarterstep-backstep halfstep –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’m going to ask one of these mindless,
primitive worker-types to dance with me!</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #1</strong>: But General Formica would be
furious!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: What a bunch of losers. Mindless zombies
capitulating to an oppressive system –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Wanna dance?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Me?! Yes!!! I mean – Just let me finish my
beer.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: So uh – how come I haven’t seen you around here
before?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I work in the palace, I don’t get out
much.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: The palace, hunh? I bet those royals really live
it up. Of course they’re all a little, you know, from inbreeding –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Now, let’s see, I – it’s been a while since I – I
think you –</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Here, I’ll lead.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Are you sure this is a real dance?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, actually, uh – I’m sort of making it up
–</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Why should everyone dance the same way? It’s as
exciting as watching fungus grow.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You’re right!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You – you think I’m right?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Why can’t I just do whatever I want to do? Why
can’t I just go wild?! Yahoo!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Hey! Watch your step, worker.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend
will beat you up!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Oh, that’s okay, I’ll let him off this time. Are
you crazy? This guy’s built like a pebble! You know they do great
prosthetic antennas nowadays –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Aren’t you gonna stand up for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: How come you don’t dance like the rest of
us?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Because – because I’m an individual!</p>
<p><strong>soldier #2</strong>: An individual? Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: You look like a worker to me.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Hey, lay off my little buddy!</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #1</strong>: Princess Bala! Princess Bala!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Princess? You’re a Princess?</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden #2</strong>: The police are coming!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Uh oh. Goodbye! Gotta run!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Wait! When can I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Let me think. Hmmnn… Never. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Wait! Princess! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Get real, Z! She just dropped the scarf by
accident!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Are you kidding? There were sparks between us!
This scarf is a sign!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: It’s a sign that you’re crazy! Do you know
what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: What’s gonna go wrong?! I take your place for the
royal inspection. Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me –
bingo! Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a
little… tea and crumpets… and you take your place again, and go march
around to your heart’s content!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You have to help me. Please, Weaver. Think of all
the things I’ve done for you!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: I can’t think of any.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well I’m gonna start doing things for you…</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Will you introduce me to some worker
girls?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You bet! They’ll really go for a sensitive guy
like you!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Maybe I’ll get lucky. You know, Z, I
wouldn’t do this for anyone but you…</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Wear this.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You’re a real buddy.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Don’t tell anyone you’re a worker. Follow
that column over there. And come right back after the inspection!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Thanks! I owe you!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Any of you guys know when the Princess will show
up? She’s kind of a personal friend.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: First of all, let me make one thing clear.
Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself. All this “thinking”
stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think,
he wouldn’t have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you’d
misplace it if it wasn’t trapped inside your head.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: “Trapped inside your head” – that’s a good one
–</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Geez – tough room.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: We ants survive as a species because we do
what we’re told. We survive because we work together, as one, we get the
job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere! Hell, we’re not an army
of ants…we’re one giant ant, with giant fists, and giant jaws!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Lays it on a little thick, doesn’t he? If you ask
me, he’s one giant bore.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Now I’ve heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a
food shortage. Well you boys are gonna be taken care of. But in the
meantime we’re gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the
enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Dammit, I’m proud to be an ant. And I know
each and every one of you boys will do your duty. Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Bravo! Bring on the Princess!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Stow the gab there, soldier! Let’s move ’em
out!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Eyes…left!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Princess! Princess Bala! Hey! It’s me! Z! I’ve
got your scarf!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Who is that idiot?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Darling, you must encourage the troops –
wave!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Excuse me, guys – That’s my date. Well, it’s been
fun. Have a great war!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hey! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: You new, kid?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I just joined up. But I’m quitting! I got a trial
membership!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Trial membership? Kid, when you join this
ant’s army, you’re in for the full hitch.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Wait a minute, there’s been a mistake! I’ve got
to get back to the colony!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Are you crazy, kid? They shoot
deserters!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: You just stick by old Barbatus. He’ll
watch out for you. Whatsamatter, kid? Leave a girl behind?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Yeah. Well – no. She’s kind of playing hard to
get. As a matter of fact, she’s playing completely unattainable. So,
what’s on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition?</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: No – we’re going to attack the
termites!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Attack? But – I hate attacking! It’s so
hostile!</p>
<p><strong>ant soldiers</strong>: Johnny Comes</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: So – these termites, they’re little, shy,
retiring insects?</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: No such luck. Those dirty terms are five
times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads!</p>
<p><strong>soldier ants</strong>: We ants go marching two by two,
hurrah! Hurrah! We’ll all be dead before we’re through, hurrah!
Hurrah!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, what exactly does our platoon do? Serve
beverages? Process paperwork?</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Our platoon has the best assignment of
all. We’re the first into battle!</p>
<p><strong>ant soldiers</strong>: We ants are marching three by three,
hurrah! Hurrah! Dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah! Hurrah!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: So we’re going back for more armor, right? I
mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat
them?!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Superior numbers, kid!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: It’s too damn quiet.</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Don’t be scared, kid. Barbatus’s got yer
back.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Maybe they went out for the evening. Let’s leave
them a message and head home.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Light it up!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: They’re here!!!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Keep your head down!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Guys! Guys! It isn’t too late for all of us to
just talk this over!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Wait! Please! Acid makes me come out in spots! –
Could I just say I have always had the greatest respect for your
species? I mean, eating wood – why didn’t I think of that?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: BARBATUS! You – you saved my life!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Don’t get all sappy about it!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I love the smell of formic acid in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Excuse me. I seem to be lost, and I was wondering
if you could give me –</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I’ll let myself out.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Shoo! – Torro! Torro!</p>
<p><strong>ant officer</strong>: He’s killed their Queen!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hey, I’m sorry, it was a mistake –</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: This is terrific! Let’s exact crippling war
reparations! Let’s set up a puppet government!</p>
<p><strong>ant officer</strong>: Let’s slaughter them all!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Z! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Barbatus?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Barbatus!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Be honest, kid – am I hurt bad?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: No, no, you’re…lookin’ good. You’ve got good
color in your cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: No – I can see it in your eyes. I’m a
goner. It’s alright, Z. In this ant’s army, a soldier’s life ain’t worth
a sack of fungus. I can’t feel my legs…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hang in there, buddy! You can make it! Just –
take deep breaths, I’ll try and find your body – it’s gotta be around
here somewhere!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: I wonder…what…was it all…for…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Barbatus, hang on – Barbatus!!</p>
<p><strong>barbatus</strong>: Don’t make my mistake, kid… don’t…be a
grunt…your whole life…</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Hey, slow it down, big boy. You’re making
the rest of us look bad…How come I haven’t seen you around here
before?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: I’m new…I was born yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Nobody told me digging was so much fun! You
pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again –
lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers –</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Mmm, yes, I see what you mean…</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: What’s the holdup here?!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Sorry, sir – I was just having a little chat
with my friend –</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Who said you could have a chat? You’re not
a chatter, you’re a digger! So shut up and dig!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Leave him alone! He’s new.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: You too? Well just for that, you lose your
day’s rations! Now get back to work!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: I don’t know what came over me, talking back
like that. I must be going crazy…</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Sorry I got you in trouble. But listen, you
can share my rations.</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Are you asking me out to dinner?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: No – I mean yes – I mean – if you don’t have
other plans.</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: I’ll make myself available…Listen, better
watch out with the backtalk. I don’t know want you to end up like the
guy who used to work next to me. I’m afraid he got… downsized.</p>
<p><strong>guard ant</strong>: Look! They’re back! The army’s back!
Alert the colony!</p>
<p><strong>excited ants</strong>: The army’s returned! Our brave boys
are back!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: It looks like only one soldier made it
back!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Poor Z – I should never have let you go!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: It was horrible…a massacre, a massacre upon a
massacre. First we massacred them, then they massacred us, then it was
halftime. I’ve never seen such violence, such bloodthirstiness, such bad
manners…I’m the only one that made it!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: No – you – you don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Damn, I’m proud of you, boy. I wish I had a
hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble. Now, time for
some R and R. You’re invited to the royal victory party!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Royal victory party? Will…will Princess Bala be
there?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Of course. The entire royal family will be
there to honor you.</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Wait a minute, that’s no soldier – that’s
Z!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Z? Our Z? The little guy made it!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Son, you’re an ant after my own heart. A
warrior. An ant that looks death right in the face and laughs.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, I generally just make belittling comments
and snicker behind death’s back. So, tell me, fellow war-monger…do you
think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Well she better – she’s engaged to one.
Me!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Engaged? As in you’re getting married?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: So…you two are in love?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: In love? I’m just a plain old soldier at
heart. I’ll tell you what I love – the field – blood – death –
orders…and the company of other warriors.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Wow, what a spread – you know, there’s a food
shortage in the rest of the colony.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Yes, and do you know why there’s a food
shortage?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: …Not enough food?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Negatory. Too many ants. And while we
soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the
namby-pamby workers live it up back home.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well I, I don’t think “living it up” is the right
term – how about “working themselves to death”?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see
myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future
of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of
us plunging his sword into the other’s heart…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Oh, hey, that’s great, I think I see an old war
buddy over there, it’s been fun chatting. Good luck with the
hallucinations.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: What do you call it when 10,000 workers are
killed in a tunnel cave- in? Who cares? They’re workers!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: But…don’t you think the worker class is the very
foundation of the colony – I mean, uh, without them, who would we stand
on?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You’re the hero of the recent termite
campaign, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy
and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I
am.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: And you are…?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’m Princess Bala.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I’m sure. So, Princess,
have you ever danced with a hero?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Oh…oh well then, one more won’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Just warming up…</p>
<p><strong>across the room</strong>: The Queen and General Formica watch
the party.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: All these parties are so marvellously
alike.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: They should be… But there’s something funny
about that soldier.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: May I cut in?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Oh, of course –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: No, General. I’m dancing with the war
hero.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Uh, sorry, General, I…I’ve always had this animal
magnetism, it –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You dance…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Divinely?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: No weirdly…You remind me of someone…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: He was swarthy…primitive… earthy…sensual.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: He was a worker. I danced with him at a
worker’s bar just the other day. I’m not shocking you, am I?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: No…as a matter of fact…</p>
<p><strong>oh my god, it’s you! you’re a</strong>: WORKER!!! A filthy,
stupid, disgusting WORKER!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I
think there are some ants in the next colony who didn’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: That’s not what you said the other night –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Quiet – sshhh!!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: – At the worker bar! You were pretty hot to trot
then!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: What’s this? A worker has been masquerading
as a war hero?!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well it wasn’t a masquerade, really, it was more
what I’d call a clever ruse –</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Can’t we all settle this like adults – we’re not
larvae anymore –</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Oh my god! He’s taking her hostage!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: No I’m not – I mean – nobody move! Or the
Princess gets it!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Stay back, you lunatic! Do you think I don’t know
how to use this?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>hold on</strong>: the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT. Nothing happens for
a moment. Then –</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: This is thoroughly unacceptable!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You’re telling me…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’m coming! I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’m going! I’m going’</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: What was that thing?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I order you to find out where we are!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Alright, alright, I’ll try to get directions from
one of the locals.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Excuse me, I – Pardon me – And they call them
social insects.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Climb up that tree and get a better view!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’ve been kidnapped by the village idiot.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Who’s the bigger idiot – the idiot who gets
kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: How dare you speak to me like that? I’m the
Princess!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Theoretically, yes. But is the monarchical
hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support
it?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Of course! It defines society! To deny the
precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the
society itself!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: But can there be a society composed of just two
ants?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: No! There’s no such thing as “just two ants.”
You never see just two ants – you see a million ants!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Look around, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I – hate – you.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well I guess that makes us even.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Ha! Don’t make me laugh. You’re crazy about
me! That’s why you lied and cheated to get near me!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Oh come on, you’re the one who came after me –
the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I was slumming it! I danced with you because
you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Is that the same standard you used to choose
General Formica?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I didn’t choose him. What kind of idiot would…
…choose who she wanted to marry?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Now, worker, you shall take me back to the
colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, that’s an appealing offer, but…considering
the options… You go back. Me, I’m going to Insectopia.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Insectopia? You stupid worker, that’s just a
fairy tale!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source… that
it exists. Now you follow the yellow egg… That direction.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Worker! Come back here now!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I’ve got a name. It’s Z.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: That’s not a name! That’s just a letter!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Worker? Oh WORKER? Where are you? Z? Z? Wait
for me!!!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: I tell ya, I’m gettin’ sick of bein’ yelled
at.</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: What do you want, we’re just workers.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: You know, you’re not just workers – you can
be whatever you want to be! Look at Z! He started as a worker – then he
became a soldier!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: That’s right! He slaughtered hundreds of
termites single-handedly!</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: I heard about this guy. He crashed a
party at the palace. Then he took a hike with one of the royal babes!
And when they tried to stop him, he just looked at a couple’a guards,
and they burst into flames!</p>
<p><strong>worker ant #1</strong>: You’re nuts, how could a worker do
all that?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Well, because he’s more than a worker…he’s
a…what did he call it, Azteca…</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Invisible!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: No – an individual!</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Well, it’s…someone with his own point of
view…someone who does what he wants, not whatever he’s told to do!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Someone who follows his heart!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Right…because every ant’s important!</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: But that would mean I’m important.</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: I’m outta here, this sounds like trouble
to me.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: We can all be individuals! Just like</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Water…water…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Water…water – oh, you already said that.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: My skin’s dry, my exoskeleton is cracking…I
wish I’d never met you, you ruined my life.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I ruined your life? Look, I was perfectly happy
until I met you – alright, I was miserable, but I was happily
miserable.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: We’re going to die!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Come on – it’s gone! What are the chances of that
happening again?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well I’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Why didn’t I listen to my mother …why’d I have
to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to
be in my position…what’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Want a list?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Wait, I hear something!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: It’s…it’s…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: This lake is huge! And so close to the colony!
Think of the vacation potential!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a
nap.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Listen, “Princess”, you can’t order me around.
Out here, you’re not the boss anymore – out here, you’re just –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Out here I’m just what?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hlllllllp!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Stop fooling around in there.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Let me go!!!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I’m going to be rescued soon. I’m going to be
rescued soon. I’m going to be rescued soon.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Princess, has it ever occurred to you that
they’re not going to rescue you?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: General Formica won’t let me die out here. I’m
his fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Look. How many other Princesses are there?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Five thousand three hundred and ninety – no.
About five thousand four hundred by now.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: And only you can become a Queen?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Well…no, but –</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: So what makes you so special?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Well…I am the oldest.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: By three seconds…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You’re right. There are as many Princesses…as
there are blades of grass.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We
can’t afford any delays on this project!</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like it,
General, they’re they’re…well, look!</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Where do ya think you’re going? Get back to
work!</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: Buzz off, I’m important!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Notice the big one, holding hands with the
female?</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: No one should have to. Have him brought to
me.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: So this Z…he fancies himself an
individual?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Yeah…I mean…well…I don’t know, really,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Well now you haven’t fallen for this silly
idea of individuality, have you?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Oh, no, sir!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Good. You’re a good soldier.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: So tell me. Where’s Z?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: I…I have no idea, sir.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Okay, son.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: We know what makes an ant colony strong,
don’t we? We know that no ant can be an individual. No single ant
matters, right?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: That’s correct, sir!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Not that one. Or that one.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Or that one? Her life doesn’t matter, does
it?</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Don’t tell that tightass anything,
Weaver!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Wait! Just let her go! Z’s long gone anyway,
following some golden egg to Insectopia! You’ll never catch him!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Insectopia, hunh?…See why individuality is
so dangerous? It can always be used against you. If this sissy here
wants to dig, he’ll dig. Send them both back to the tunnel project.
Double their workload.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: What do we have on this “Insectopia”?</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Scattered reports, sir. Rumors. Nothing
reliable.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Desperate times call for desperate
measures. Get me Ant Team Six.</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Ant Team Six…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: I swear, we’ve passed this blade of grass
three times.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Face it, Z, we’re lost! We must have walked
halfway across the world by now! How did I get into this mess…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Come on…tell me there wasn’t just a
little…something between us that first night at the bar. The night we
danced.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: What difference does it make…we’re both going
to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: …The land of red and white…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: We’ve found it! Insectopia! Look at all this
food’</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You were right…you were right! Z, it’s
beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Let’s dig in!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: There’s - there’s some kind of force field!</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Muffy, look, party-crashers.</p>
<p><strong>female wasp</strong>: They’re simply too much, Chip!</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: You down there, haven’t you ever been to
a picnic?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hunh?</p>
<p><strong>female wasp</strong>: Habla Ingles? Well I really don’t know
who they are.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: We’re ants!</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Poopsie, we know some ants, don’t we? Are
you related to the Fifth Avenue ants?</p>
<p><strong>female wasp</strong>: Darling, do you have to talk to any
insect from off the street?</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Just being friendly, Poopsie.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Hello? I’m not just “any insect”. My mother is
the Queen. I’m Princess Bala!</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: They’re Eurotrash, dear.</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Lunch! A little piece of advice, sport –
bob and weave! Bob and weave!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Well – like my father used to say –
there’s no such thing as a free meal!</p>
<p><strong>the wasps</strong>: Excuse me – I’ll have some potato salad –
thank-you! – don’t mind if I do! After you!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I sort of imagined Insectopia a little
differently –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Oh…my…God.</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Muffy! Muffy! Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Bala, look out!!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: MMMffllmmm…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z! Help me!!!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Bala! I’ll never see her again…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z!!! Get me out of heeeeere!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: These things always come in twos…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Take me to your leader!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Whoooooooaaaa!!!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Bala! Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z!!!!!!! I’m stuck!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z! You’re here!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Yeah. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z…if we don’t make it…I just want you to
know….</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: This is all your fault!!!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: We’re safe…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Who the hell is that?!!!</p>
<p><strong>tough voice</strong>: Ant Team Six – take him out!</p>
<p><strong>major mandible</strong>: And don’t come back, you sissy!</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>commando ant</strong>: Z and the Princess were here, sir.
Signs of a struggle.</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Let’s get a read on that feremone
track.</p>
<p><strong>commando ant #1</strong>: Get the sniffer!</p>
<p><strong>tracker ant</strong>: Bala…find Bala…</p>
<p><strong>tracker ant</strong>: Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono
no…</p>
<p><strong>commando ant #3</strong>: Got ’em! Ten clicks from here!</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Z – you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing,
wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Let’s MOVE! GO, people! GO! GO!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Come on, Z.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Forget it. You go ahead, I give up. I…I don’t
know what I was thinking. “Insectopia”.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: There’s only one thing worse than an ant who goes
around mindlessly following orders, and that’s an ant who’s too dumb to
go around mindlessly following orders.</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: What’s with the bummer attitude?</p>
<p><strong>butterfly</strong>: Yeah – nobody stresses out in
Insectopia!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Did you say…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: …Insectopia?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z, we made it!</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: C’mon in! The nectar’s fine!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Yippeeeeee!</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: Hey, take it easy! There’s nothin’ to be afraid
of!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Yeah, well, I make it a practice not to trust
anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead.</p>
<p><strong>cricket</strong>: Dude, here in Insectopia, we don’t judge
people by how many arms and legs we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: Yeah, back home, they called me a fruitfly. But
here, I’m known as… Superfly.</p>
<p><strong>cricket</strong>: Anyway, big Gus is mellow.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Charmed.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: So…you never did tell me…what made you come out
to the worker bar that night?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, “trouble” is my middle name. Actually, my
middle name is .985, but I don’t tell people. Hey, Bala, I…I actually
have something of yours…you left it at the bar that night.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Sorry, it’s been through a war, not to mention
everything else…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: You held onto this all that time?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, I…I know it’s a little strange, but…I
thought it might come in handy if I…needed a scarf someday. Well, to be
honest, I just liked having it.</p>
<p><strong>beetle</strong>: Hey Z!</p>
<p><strong>beetle</strong>: Wanna bring back dessert? There’s a thirty
foot long blimp in the next can, made completely of chocolate!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Sure. I wasn’t busy or anything.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Great timing, guys. Ever wonder why they call you
“pests”?</p>
<p><strong>tracker ant</strong>: Yesyesyesyesyes –</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>commando #1</strong>: I’ve got a read on the Princess – but
target Z isn’t accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Let’s move in.</p>
<p><strong>cricket</strong>: What if, like…we’re just these tiny little
things, and we’re just like part of this whole other huge universe,
that’s like, so big we don’t even know it exists?</p>
<p><strong>ladybug</strong>: Man…that’s so deep…</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Alright, you hippy scum! Make one move and
I’ll exterminate you!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Stop! You don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: I don’t have to understand, Missy – I’ve
got orders. Now where’s Z?</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: Man, your girl is fly, know what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Oh, Bala? I guess she’s okay, you know, for a
princess. I mean, I usually date queens, or you know, empresses, because
sometimes the lesser nobility are too much in awe of my smouldering
sensuality. Please stop me if I’m making you feel inadequate.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: What’s the matter? This place is as cheery as a
Roach Motel at check-out time.</p>
<p><strong>ladybug</strong>: Bala’s been kidnapped! Some flying ants
took her back to the colony!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: She’s been kidnapped?! But I can’t live without
her!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I’m going back. I’ve got to get her. Who’ll come
with me?</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You?!</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: I know what it’s like to lose someone…I
keep hearing the sound of Muffy’s flapping wings…so I’ll take you.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Let’s go, pal!</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: Geez. I feel like a real stinkbug.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Wow…I never saw things this way…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Things look so close together from up
here…there’s the desert…and the lake… it’s not far from the colony at
all…</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Sorry. Turbulence.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Princess Bala. Good. Where’s Z?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: He’s…he’s dead. You don’t have to look for him
anymore. He was eaten by a praying mantis.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: It’s a shame he died prematurely…I was
hoping to kill him myself.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Well you’ll never be able to hurt him where he
is now. I miss him already.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: You miss him? Why?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Because…because he’s twice the ant that you
are. I could never go through with marrying you. I’m – I’m an
individual, and when I get married, it’ll be to someone I choose.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Princess Bala, I’m just a simple old
soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for
me. But one thing I do know is, there are more Princesses where you came
from. I just hope they’re not all like you. In the meantime, maybe we
can arrange for you to see Z again after all.</p>
<p><strong>male wasp</strong>: Good luck, Z. For a wingless insect,
you’re alright by me.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Thanks, Chip.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: How am I going to get in? The place is crawling
with soldiers!</p>
<p><strong>soldier ant</strong>: You there! Worker!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Don’t bite! I surrender!</p>
<p><strong>soldier ant</strong>: What are you doing out here! All
workers are to remain inside the colony, by orders of General
Formica!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well…if you insist…</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Very impressive, General.</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Wave that flag, you maggot!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Is there anything wrong, your majesty?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: It’s just…How I miss Bala. I wish she were
here for this special moment.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: She is, your majesty. She is.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Geez, this place really empties out in August.
Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>tracker ant</strong>: Z! Z! I smell Z!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You “smell” me? Well look, I – I’ve been out in
the wilderness for a while, and –</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Hey, wait, you’re…you’re one of those pheremone
sniffers, aren’t you? Maybe you can help me…I’m looking for a friend of
mine, Princess Bala.</p>
<p><strong>tracker ant</strong>: Bala! Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah! Find Bala!
Yeahyeahyeahyeah!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Just remember, I met her first.</p>
<p><strong>tracker ant</strong>: Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Bala’s through there?</p>
<p><strong>tracker ant</strong>: Bala…Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Great. More digging. This is why I left in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Bala!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z! You came back!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Why do they have you tied up here?</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: There’s something going on, Z –</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: They’re having a ceremony to open the
Megatunnel…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Bala, that – that lake we found – I think the
tunnel’s right underneath it! – Formica’s going to flood the colony!!!
That’s what he meant when said there were too many ants!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z! what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I know it’s crazy, but – I can’t just leave.
Don’t argue with me. If I’ve learned anything, it’s that the problems of
two people don’t add up to a hill of ants in this world. Or beans.
Something like that. Anyway, I’ve got to warn the others.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Head for the surface, Bala. If I don’t make it,
well…we’ll always have Insectopia.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z!!! Wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Your majesty, I’m afraid matters of state
keep me from attending the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: But General – this tunnel is your baby!
You’re sure you can’t stay ?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: ’Fraid not, your majesty. Goodbye, your
majesty.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Very well, General – I know you – all work
and no play!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Alright, let’s move out!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: In the name of the colony, I declare this
tunnel open!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Stoooooop!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Bala!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Listen up! We’ve all got to get out of here! This
place is going to flood!</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: You’ve got to believe me!</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: Oh yeah? What makes you so special,
Mr. Know-It-All?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I’m Z.</p>
<p><strong>worker #3</strong>: You’re Z? Gimme a break! Z’s ten
milimeters tall!</p>
<p><strong>worker #4</strong>: – and he can kill termites with his bare
hands! You’re just some scrawny worker with a mental problem!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I am Z!</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: No you’re not!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Weaver!</p>
<p><strong>workers</strong>: Hey…it is Z…listen to what he says! .</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Z…I’m so sorry! I –</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Don’t worry about it, pal.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Oh…it’s that social-climbing worker again –
what does he want?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: To save you all! Now we’ve got to go!</p>
<p><strong>mandible</strong>: Let ’er rip!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: Listen!</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: He’s right!!!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: You there! Stop! I say!</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: There’s no way out!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: We’re all going to drown!!!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: Z…what can we do?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Dig!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: We’ve got to dig a trench around us!</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: Uh…we don’t dig any more. We’re
individuals.</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: Yeah. We’re too important to dig. You
taught us that, Z. You hate digging!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Yeah, but I hate drowning more! Now dig!</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: You heard the ant – DIG!!!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: That’s it! Pass the dirt back to the center! Go
on!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Your highness…time to get your hands dirty!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: We need to form a scaffolding around this mound –
let’s DO IT!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Now climb!</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Okay boys – take her up!</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: He did it! Z! Z! Z! Z! Z!</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Z. I should have known. All that work, all
that preparation, come to nothing. All because of one stinking ant.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Folks, you may have survived that flood,
but there’s no way you’re gonna escape from me. I’ll make you a deal.
Hand over the rebel leader Z, and you survive.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: But if you don’t hand him over, you’re all
going to die, each and every single…“individual” one of you.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: What shall it be, workers?</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Have it your way.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: …I’m Z.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: No, I’m Z.</p>
<p><strong>azteca</strong>: I’m Z!</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: No, I’m Z.</p>
<p><strong>workers</strong>: I’m Z! I’m Z! I’m Z and so is my brother!
I’ve been Z for weeks now!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: We are Z.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: I am Z! I am Z! I am Z!</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: Hey, guys!</p>
<p><strong>wasp</strong>: It’s them!</p>
<p><strong>wasp</strong>: Are these hooligans giving you trouble, Z?</p>
<p><strong>fly</strong>: Say the word, Z, and we kick their butts.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: What are you doing?! ATTACK!! Come on, you
yellow-bellies! Don’t just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Uh, actually, we are outnumbered sir…</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Help…help me…</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: Please…I…I can’t swim…Help me…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I thought you said that the life of one ant
doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>formica</strong>: I guess it does…to the ant.</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Sir, if it’s any consolation, I still
think you’re completely worthless as an individual.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: So, uh, that’s pretty much it. Just your basic
“simple worker overthrows the government and winds up with the princess”
kind of a story. You know: there was the big parade and everything…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: General Formica was almost unemployable. He
eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: The Queen asked me to take over his job, but I
said “Sorry, but I’m really not the general type. I’m more the specific
type.” So they gave the job to Weaver instead.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Weaver cut the defense budget in half. Now we
only have an army of five million.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: And me, I guess you could say that I lived
happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: I mean, I’ve got the whole package, right? A
great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.</p>
<p><strong>bala</strong>: A few?</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Well, so nothing’s perfect. But you know? I
wouldn’t change a thing.</p>
