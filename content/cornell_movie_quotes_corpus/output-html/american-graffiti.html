<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Awwrigght, baay-haay-baay! I got a oldie
for ya–gonna knock ya right on de flowa–baay-haay-hee-baay!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night in town,
you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: The Moose have been lookin’ for you all day,
man.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Oh great…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Whadaya got, whadaya got? Wow–two thousand
dollars. Two thousand doll– !!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mr. Jenning couldn’t find you, so he gave it
to me to give to you. He said he’s sorry it’s so late, but it’s the
first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he says
they’re all very proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well… ah… why don’t you hold onto it for a
while?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s with you? It’s yours! Take it! I don’t
want it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Steve… Ah, I think we’d better have a talk.
I’ve gotten-</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Your sister calls. I’ll talk to you
later.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Now, Steve! Let her wait.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay, make it short and sweet.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah, well… Listen… I… I don’t think I’m going
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What! Come on, what are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I don’t know. I was thinking I might wait for
a year… go to city–</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You chicken fink.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Wait, let me explain–</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You can’t back out now! After all we went
through to get accepted. We’re finally getting out of this turkey town
and now you want to crawl back into your cell–look, I gotta talk to
Laurie. Now take it. We’re leaving in the morning. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You wanna end up like John? You can’t stay
seventeen forever.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I just want some time to think. What’s the
rush? I’ll go next year.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’ll talk later.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: “Here comes the Wolfman–Wolfman Jack!”</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Oh, We’re gonna rock and roll ourselves to
death baby. You got the Wolfman Jack Show!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi John!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not too good, huh?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Why is it every girl that comes around here is
ugly? Or has a boyfriend? Where is the dazzling beauty I’ve been
searching for all my life?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know what you mean. The pickin’s are really
gettin’ slim. The whole strip is shrinking. Ah, you know, I remember
about five years ago, take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas
just to make one circuit. It was really somethin.’</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hey, John. Someone new in town.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ahhh.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: You gonna go after him?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, listen, Professor, if he can’t find me,
then he ain’t worth racin’, right?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: The big shot!</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate
mountain. Anything else you want, Steve? If there is you let me know
now. Just honk and I’m yours.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: One fries–grab it before I drop it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Where was I?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Um, how you thought high school romances
were goofy and we started going together just because you thought I was
kinda cute and funny, but then you suddenly realized you were in love
with me, it was serious… and ah… oh, you were leadin’ up to somethin’
kinda big.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You make it sound like I’m giving dictation.
Well, seriously, what I meant was, that ah… since we do care for each
other so much, and since we should really consider ourselves as adults.
Now, I, ah… could I have a couple of those fries?</p>
<p><strong>terry:</strong>: Come on, Budda. Come on…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ah, where was I?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: …“consider ourselves adults”…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Right… right… anyway, I thought maybe, before
I leave, we could ah… agree that… that seeing other people while I’m
away can’t possibly hurt, you know?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You mean dating other people?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think it would strengthen our relationship.
Then we’d know for sure that we’re really in love. Not that there’s any
doubt.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I think you’re right. I mean, we’re not kids
anymore, and it’s silly to think that when we’re three thousand miles
apart we shouldn’t be able to see other people and go out.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Laurie, now, listen, I didn’t ask for that
back. I think that…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I know. I just sort of think it’s juvenile
now. I’ll keep it at home. It’s less conspicuous there.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You don’t want to wear it?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I didn’t say that. I understand and I’m not
upset. I mean, I can’t expect you to be a monk or something while you’re
away.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: …and I have a really sharp record collection.
I even have “Pledging My Love” by Johnny Ace. Anyway, how can you love
Nelson when he’s going out with Marilyn Gator. Since he dumped on you
maybe we could–</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: He didn’t dump on me, you little dip. Hi,
Steve!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She’s a little conceited–just playing hard to
get.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Listen, I came over here to talk to you
about–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Any time, buddy. I’m your man. Nothing I like
better than chewing the rug with a pal. You talk, I’ll listen. I’m all
ears. Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Terry, I’m going to let you take care of my
car while we’re away–at least until Christmas. I’m afraid if I leave it
with my–</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hey, sis–what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Now listen, only 30 weight Castrol- R. I’ve
written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove compartment.
Are you listening?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: What’s wrong, he’s crying!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I can’t… believe… it. I don’t know what to
say. I’ll… love and protect this car until death do us part. This is a
superfine machine. This may even be better than Daryl Starbird’s
superfleck moonbird. It is better than Daryl Starbird’s.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Budda, how would you like to go to the
drive-in movies with me?</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Would I kid you about a thing like that? I
want you to know that something has happened to me tonight that is going
to change everything. I’ve got a new…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Car!! All right, who’s the wise– Oh,
John–verrry funny.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, did she do that to you?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s get going. It seems like we’ve spent
most of our lives in this parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, Curt, let’s bomb around, I wanna try out
my new wheels!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I’d like to, Toad, but I’m going with Steve
and Laurie to the hop. I’d just slow you down anyway.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, tonight things are going to be
different.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, wait a minute, you’re goin’ to the Hop?
The Freshman Hop?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, come on, man. That place is for kids. You
two just got your ass out of there. Don’t go back now.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: You ain’t got no emotions?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: We’re gonna remember all of the good times,
is what we’re gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well, go.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Why don’t you come with us?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bullshit, man!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Come on. For old time’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, yeah… Well, listen. You go. Go ahead,
Curtsy, baby. You go on over there and you remember all the good times
you won’t be having. I ain’t goin’ off to some goddamned fancy college.
I’m stayin’ right here. Havin’ fun, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jesus, Milner, you’re in a great mood
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: What’s the matter John? Did I say somethin’
wrong? I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah, man, it’s nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, we’ll see you later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: We’ll all do somethin’ together. You know,
before Steve leaves.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, wait a minute. Now, you’re not
going?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Wolfman?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This is Joe… in Little Rock, way down in the
Valley.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: You callin’ from Little Rock,
California?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Long distance.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: My, my, my… listen, man, what kind of
entertainment you got in that town?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: All we got is you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Zudo.</p>
<p><strong>pazudo</strong>: Hey, Milner.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, man, what happened to your flathead?</p>
<p><strong>pazudo</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What happened to your flathead?</p>
<p><strong>pazudo</strong>: Ah, your mother!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pazudo</strong>: Your mother. Hey, we been talkin’ about
you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pazudo</strong>: Yeah. There’s a very wicked ‘55 Chevy
lookin’ for you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>pazudo</strong>: Watch out for the cop that’s in Jerry’s
Cherry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. All right, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, Toad.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Is that you in that beautiful car? Geez, what a
waste of machinery.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hey, kid.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Here we go with another call out of the
station. Can you dig it? Answer the phone, dummy.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Pinkie’s Pizza</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Ah, yeah, listen, you got any more of those
secret agent spy-scopes?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hit parade on the stethoscope?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: No. No, the secret agent spy-scope, man.
That pulls in the moon, the sky and the planets… and the satellites and
the little bitty space men.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You must have the wrong number, partner.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: What? What?!!!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Quick! Hang a right!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Cut over to G Street, I’ve just seen a vision!
She was a goddess. You’ve got to catch her!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I didn’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: We’re not going to spend the night chasing
girls for you.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I’m telling you, this was the most perfect,
dazzling creature I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She’s gone. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: She spoke to me. She spoke to me, right
through the window. I think she said, “I love you.”</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: That means nothing to you people? You have no
romance, no soul? She– someone wants me. Someone roaming the streets
wants me! Will you turn the corner?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, oh. Later.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Alligator.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, you’re new around here. Where’re you
from?</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Turlock.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Turlock? You know a guy named Frank
Bartlett?</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: No. Does he go to Turlock High?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, he used to. He goes to J.C. now.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Do you go to J.C.?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Oh, wow! Do you know Guy Phillips?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, sure. I got him in a class.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: He’s so boss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How would you like to ride around with me for
awhile?</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t. I’m going
steady.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah, come on!</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re just ridin’ around with a bunch of
girls. Hey, how about somebody else in there? Anybody else want to go
for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aw, come on… I got plenty of room. It’s
dangerous to have that many people in a car. Cops see ya, you’re had.
You got nothing to fear, I’m as harmless as a baby kitten.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’ll go. I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Judy’s sister wants to ride with you. Is
that all right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, sure, Judy–her sister–her
mother–anybody. I’ll take ’em all. Listen, we’ll go up and stop at that
light. It’ll turn red by the time we get there. All right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You ever get tired of going steady with
somebody that ain’t around–I’m up for grabs.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, you’re Judy’s little sister.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah, shit,–how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Old enough. How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m too old for you.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You can’t be that old.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen, listen. I think you better go back and
sit with your sister. Hey, ah… where are they, anyway? They comin’ back
or somethin’? This is a joke, right? This better be a joke, ‘cause I’m
not drivin’ you around.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: But you asked me. What’s the matter? Am I too
ugly? Judy doesn’t want me with her and now you don’t want me with you.
Nobody wants me… even my mother and father hate me. Everybody hates
me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No they don’t. I mean, I don’t know, maybe
they do. But I don’t. It’s just that you’re a little young for me.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I am not! If you throw me out I’ll
scream.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: OK, OK, just stay cool. There’s no need to
scream. We’ll think of something. It shouldn’t take too long to find
your sister again.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey John–you gonna be there tonight?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, shit! Hey, get down!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, cool…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Hey, is this what they call copping a
feel?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: NO! Uh uh. N-O. Don’t even say that.
Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mud, if anybody sees you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What you got in there, kid?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: More than you can handle.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Excuse me, but I think we’ve had an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, goddamnit, I won’t report you this
time, but next time just watch it, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: I’ll give you $525 for her on a
practically new Corvette… and on top of this, I’m going to know 10% off
the low price of this beautiful Vette. I’m talking about only $98 down
and $98 a month. Now, how am I able to make you this incredible offer?
I’ll tell you! I’m forced to move all the sporty cars off the lot as
quickly as I can. Boss’s orders. He doesn’t want ’em. I think it’s a
mistake, but what can I do?</p>
<p><strong>herbie and the heartbeats</strong>: One, two, three, four–
one, two three, four– BAH… BAH… BAH…</p>
<p><strong>bah… bah… bah… bah… bah…</strong>: BAH… BAH… BAH… At the
hop!!</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Hey, why are you so depressed? You’ll forget
him in a week. Listen, after you’re elected senior queen you’ll have so
many boys after your bod–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I don’t want to go out with anybody
else.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Laurie, I know it’s a drag but you
can’t–remember what happened to Evelyn Chelnick? When Mike went to the
Marines? She had a nervous breakdown and was acting so wacky she got run
over by a bus.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I just wish I could go with him or
something.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Laurie, jeez… Come on.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s what?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, zit make-up! Wait till I tell–hey,
everybody, Eddie–</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come on, Steve–don’t. Just cool it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let me see some of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You leave tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You and Laurie engaged yet?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, but we got it worked out. We’re still
going together but we can date other people.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And screw around–I hear college girls really
give out.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Come on what?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Laurie, I want to dance.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Who’s stopping you?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Laurie, I thought since this was our last
night together for 3 months, you might want to dance with me.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: How sentimental. You’ll be back at
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I want to dance now, not at Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Get your cooties off me–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Go ahead, slug me, scar my face. I wouldn’t
dance with you if you were the last guy left in this gym.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Uh, Peg, I think we should dance.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: No, this is getting good.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’ll dance with you, Eddie. You don’t mind,
do you, Peggy?</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Joe College strikes out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Hey–Curtis!</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Curtis, come here. Help me, will you? I’m
surrounded.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You won’t dance? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: No, really, I’d like to, but I can’t. I
mean, if old Mr. Simpson came in here and saw me dancing with one of you
sexy little–excuse me… one of you young ladies, he’d have my rear
end.</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Aahhh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Hey, Warren. Come on, gentlemen, back
inside. Put ’em out. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: out a pack of</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: All right. Hey, I thought you’d left.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No, not yet. I have no matches.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Brother, how do I get stuck with dance
supervision? Will you tell me that?… You going back East? Boy, I
remember the day I went off. Got drunk as hell the night before.
Just–</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Blotto.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Blotto. Exactly. Barfed on the train all
the next day.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Cute. Very cute. Where’d you go again?</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Middlebury. Vermont. Got a
scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: And only stayed a semester.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: One semester. And after all that, I came
back here.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Decided I wasn’t the competitive type. I
don’t know… maybe I was scared.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, you know I might find I’m not the
competitive type myself.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, I’m not really sure that I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Hey, now–don’t be stupid. Go. Experience
life. Have some fun, Curtis.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Bill?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I mean–Mr. Wolfe. Can I speak with you a
minute. Hi, Curt.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Jane…</p>
<p><strong>mr. wolfe</strong>: Anyway–good luck, Curtis.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah… I’ll see you. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: A Wolfman exclusive for ya now. The Beach
Boys, baby, a brand new group. I predict they gonna go a long way. This
is called “Surfin’ Safari.”</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: So the next night we found out where they
parked and went out with ammunition.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t you have homework or something to
do?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No sweat–my mother does it. Anyway, he
thought he was had. He started the car and couldn’t see through the
windshield–and zoomed straight into the canal–it was a riot.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I still got some, so don’t try anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, watch it will ya! Jesus Christ, thanks a
lot. Hey, drivin’ is a serious business. I ain’t havin’ no accidents
because of you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, don’t give me any grief. I’m warning
ya.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Spare me, killer.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t like that surfing shit. Rock ’n Roll’s
been going downhill ever since Buddy Holly died.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Don’t you think the Beach Boys are boss!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You would, you grungy little twerp.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Grungy? You big weenie, if I had a boyfriend
he’d pound you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure–ah, shit, Holstein!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Good, a cop–I’m going to tell him you tried
to rape me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, no–No. Hey–</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s past my curfew. I’m going to tell him
how old I am, my parents don’t know I’m out and you tried to rape me.
Boy, are you up a creek.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey–ah, really–don’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: If you say “I was a dirty bird. Carol’s not
grungy, she’s bitchin’.”</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Say it–I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was a dirty bird, Carol’s not grungy, she’s
bitchin.’</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Okay–I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: Where you going, Milner?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m going home–sir.</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: Where you been, Milner?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah–at the movies–sir.</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: Milner, you weren’t around the 12th and G
streets at about 8:30, were you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I wa at the movies–like I said– sir.</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: Uh-huh. Milner, the reason I stopped you
was because the light on your license plate is out. I’m gonna have to
cite you for that. And Milner, the front end of this… this… this thing
you’re driving looks a little low.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, no sir. It’s twelve and a half inches.
Regulation size. Now, it’s been checked several times. You can check it
if you like, sir.</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: Look, Milner.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: You can’t fool with the law.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: We know that was you tonight. We have an
excellent description of this car. I could run you in right now and I
could make it stick. But I’m not gonna do that, Milner, you know
why?</p>
<p><strong>holstein</strong>: Because I want to catch you in the act.
And when I do, I’m gonna nail you, but good. Happy Birthday, Milner.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you–asshole.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’re a regular J.D.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here, file that under C.S. over there.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: C.S.? What’s that stand for?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Chicken shit–that’s what it is.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: Ain’t he neat?</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Hey, you know a guy around here with a piss
yellow deuce coupe–supposed to be hot stuff?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You mean John Milner?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, nobody can beat him, man. He’s got the
fastest–</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: I ain’t nobody, dork. Right?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Hey, you see this Milner, you tell him I’m
lookin’ for him, huh? Tell him I aim to blow his ass right off the
road.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: Ain’t he neat?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What a babe… what a bitchin’ babe… And
Wolfman Baby, she’s all mine.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Okay, honey, here I come–James Dean
lives!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Stay cool, honey–don’t let those creeps bug
you. Wolfman, please don’t let those creeps bug her… please.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hi! Hello… buenos noches? Need a lift? Nice
night for a walk? Do you know John Milner? Curt Henderson? Sure you
wouldn’t like a ride somewhere? Did anyone ever tell you that you look
just like Connie Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You do! I mean it! Just like Connie Stevens.
I met her once.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: For real?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. At a Dick Clark road show.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You really think I look like her?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No shit–excuse me, I mean I’m not just
feeding you a line. You look like Connie Stevens. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Debbie. I always though I looked like Sandra
Dee.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh yeah–well, you look a lot like her
too.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: This your car?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. I’m Terry the–they call me Terry the
Tiger.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s really tough looking.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What school do you go to?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Dewey–can it lay rubber?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh yeah, it’s got a 327 Chevy mill with six
Strombergs.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Wow–bitchin’ tuck and roll. I just love the
feel of tuck and roll upholstery.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, come on in–I’ll let you feel it. I
mean, you can touch it if you want– I mean the upholstery, you know.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Peel out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Peel out. I love it when guys peel out.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: –a great band and they came all the way from
Stockton. Let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: And we want to thank Darby Langdon, who did
all these neat decorations.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I don’t care if you leave this second.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Now the next dance is gonna be a snowball and
leading it off is last year’s class president Steven Bolander– and this
year’s head cheerleader, Laurie Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s wrong with you! You’re acting like a
snotty–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh God, come on.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Come on what?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh, Steven–please, everybody’s watching.
Smile or something.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You think I care if you go off. You think
I’m going to crack up or something. Are you conceited!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Quit–quit pinching–I don’t know why I ever
started taking you out in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You take me out? When we first met you
didn’t have enough sense to take the garbage out… I asked you out,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What do you mean, you asked me out!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Backwards Day–remember? If I had waited for
you to ask me–even after that you didn’t call me for two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I was busy.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You were scared. Dave Oboler told me. Then
when you did ask me out you didn’t kiss me for three dates.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well–I was–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Scared–Jim Kaylor told me. I even asked my
father why you hadn’t kissed me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Your father–great!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: He said he thought you were bright and you’d
probably think of kissing me after a while.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You didn’t, of course. I had to. Remember
that picnic?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Out at the canyon?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh boy! You can’t remember anything– the
first one, up at the lake. That was the first time you kissed me–I
practically had to throw myself at you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What are you doin’, stealing hub caps?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well–hey, Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: How’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Fine. Great. How’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m coming–wait a sec. She’s got her car.
Hey, I thought you were going away to school.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Ah, maybe… maybe.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Same old Curt. All the time we were going
together you never knew what you were doing… well, anyway, I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hey, Wendy–where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, you mind if I come along?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mr. kroot</strong>: All right, Bolander, break it up. You
know the rules. You and your panting girlfriend want to do that you’ll
have to go someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Kroot!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Why don’t you go kiss a duck.</p>
<p><strong>kroot</strong>: What? What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I said go kiss a duck, marblehead.</p>
<p><strong>mr. kroot</strong>: Bolander–you’re suspended. You’re– don’t
even come Monday. You are out!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I graduated last semester.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Get your shoes. Let’s go before we get thrown
out.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hello, Wolfman.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This is Weird Willard.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Hold on a minute, let me get my pants off…
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Why don’t we go to the canal?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Listen, I can get tough with you too, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yeah, hard tough.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: I got ’em down around my knees, man. Wear
these tight pants. I can’t get ’em… All right, I’m gonna do my little
dance now, man.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I go to Dewey too, ya know.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I never seen ya.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I bug out a lot. When I graduate, I’m going
to join the Marines.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: They got the best uniforms. But what if
there’s a war?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: With the bomb, who’s going to start it? We’d
all blow up together. Anyway, I’d rather be at the front. I’m like
that–rather be where the action is, you know. Once I got in a fight
with–</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I love Eddie Burns.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Eddie Burns–oh, yeah, Eddie Burns. I met him
once, too.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You really think I look like Connie Stevens?
I like her–Tuesday Weld is too much of a beatnik, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, beatniks are losers.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Who do you like? I mean, singers and
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ah hell–I like most of the people you
like.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: That’s nice–we got a lot in common.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You know what I’d like more than anything in
the world right now?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I’d love a double Chubby Chuck. Isn’t that
what you’d like more than anything right now?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: A double Chubby Chuck, a Mexicali Chili Barb,
two orders of French fries–</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And cherry cokes.</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Ark, wark, dork.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Now wait a minute. What? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Ark, wark, dork.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, right. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Hey, Deb. How’s my soft baby?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Beat it, Vic. I’m not your baby.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Oh, come on, honey. So I never called you back.
I’ve been, you know, busy…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Three weeks… besides, it only took one night
for me to realize that if brains were dynamite, you couldn’t blow your
nose.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Look who’s talking. Who’s the wimp you’re
hanging out with now? Einstein?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Tiger happens to be very intelligent. Unlike
you. I know every thing your dirty little mind is thinking… …it
shows…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, now– I mean, hey now, buddy, the lady
obviously doesn’t–</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Look, creep, you want a knuckle sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ah, no thanks, I’m waiting for a double
Chubby–Chuck…</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Then shut your smart ass mouth! I’ll call ya,
Deb, some night when I’m hard up.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I won’t be home.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You seem to, ah–know a lot of weird guys.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: That sex fiend is not a friend of mine; he’s
just horny. That’s why I like you, you’re different.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I am? You really think I’m intelligent?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Yeah. And I’ll bet you’re smart enough to
get us some brew.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Brew?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Brew… oh–yeah… oh, sure… Yes! Liquor! This
place is too crowded anyway.</p>
<p><strong>car hop</strong>: What about your double Chubby Chuck,
mexicali-chili-barb and –two cherry cokes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: There–don’t you see it? Speed up, you’re
losing her–</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Quit shouting in my ear!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Cut around him, cut around him.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: There, hang a right–over there!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: You lost her!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What’s wrong with you? You know Bobbie gets
nose bleeds when she’s upset.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: I do not! You shut up!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Lost her again. Ah, Wendy, my old lover, come
back here and console me.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Eat your heart out. Who was she anyway?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I don’t know, but I’m going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: I know her!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Okay, come on, who is she?</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: You know Mr. Beeman? He owns Hepcat
Jewelers.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Well, she’s his wife.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: But she was young and beautiful, and cruising
10th Street. You’re thinking of someone else.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Mr. Beeman’s not so old.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: What cruel fate keeps me from my true love?
How am I ever going to meet her?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Did you know that my ex is going to become a
presidential aide? It’s supposed to be a secret, but his big ambition in
life is to shake hands with President Kennedy. How are you going to
accomplish that at J.C.?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Maybe I’ve grown up. Maybe I’ve changed my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Maybe you don’t think you can do it!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Maybe you should shut up!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Maybe I will… and maybe I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Why don’t you move your bod into aft chamber,
where we might discuss this in private.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Come on, Wendy? She doesn’t say anything. They
pull up to a stoplight. Wendy looks at the red stoplight and then
abruptly gets out of the car and jumps in the back.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, slide over, I’m not sitting on your
lap.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: To the Opera, James.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Drop dead.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam and have an
orgy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You wish.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’ve been silly. I’m glad you’re going to
stay. Maybe we’ll have some classes together.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Look, there’s Kip Pullman! He’s so neat.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Do you know Kip?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Huh? Yeah, I know him.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Talk to him when we go by.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: What do you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Anything… I just want to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Kip, baby, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Henderson, long time no see. Whadaya been
doing?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Not much, just wanted to let you know that
Bobbie here is hopelessly in love with you and trembles at the sight of
your rippling biceps…</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: You creep, fink, son-of-a-bitch–</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Help, wait! Joke–Joke–Bobbie, remember your
nose bleeds!</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Get out–get out of my car–I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Excuse me–ouch–Wendy–I got to go now.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Curt, I hope I see you at registration. Call
me if you want. It was nice seeing you again.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Oh shit–there!! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Went to a dance lookin’ for romance. Found
Barbara Ann… baby… Hey, this one is for all you out there watchin’ the
Submarine Races.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’m so thirsty, I could die. Just a little 10
cent coke to wet my whistle. It won’t take a minute, I can drink it in
the–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why don’t you just get out and get one then!
So long, goodbye, hasta lumbago.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All right, one coke and then home.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Isn’t it great, the way I can cry whenever I
want. A lot of people can’t do that, but Vicki showed me how. I bet you
can’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t count on it. I may surprise you any
minute now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One ten cent coke. Is ice extra? All right,
ice.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Thanks for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh rats, I though some of my friends might be
here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Probably a couple of weeks past their
bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Wait, there’s Dee Dee. I hope she sees
me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Shit, Dee Dee!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Hiya, John. Say, do you think if I brought my
Mopar by the shop Monday you could spot weld the bumper bracket?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have to be before noon.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Sure. Hey, have you met Linda?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. Hi–ahh, this is my, ahh, cousin, Carol.
I’m kinda babysitting tonight.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Babysitting!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus–watch it, will yuh? Been hittin’ me all
night. Kids will be kids, you know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Watch out–damn it! Look what–why don’t you
grow up! We don’t get along too well. It’s been like this–</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You spastic creep!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We don’t get along too well. You know what
cousins are like.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Yeah… well, I’ll see ya on Monday before
noon.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Hi cousin, how’s your bod?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Do you have an ID?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No… hey, but no sweat. What’ll it be? Beer,
little wine?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: If you could get some Old Harper, I’d give
you a French kiss.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Old Harper, rrright! He gives her an OK sign
with his fingers and goes over to the store. He starts to enter, then
stops and thinks. He sees a man in a business suit approaching, and
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Excuse me, sir, while you’re in there– I
mean, since you’re going in anyway, I wonder if–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes, son?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Could you–sir–could you give me the time?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Why sure, it’s a quarter to twelve.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Great. Quarter to twelve. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Pardon me, sir, but I lost my I.D. in–in a
flood and I’d like to get some Old Harper, hard stuff. Would you mind
buying a bottle for me?</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: Why certainly, I lost my wife, too– her name
wasn’t Idy, though, and it wasn’t in a flood–but I know what ya–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Thanks, here’s enough for a pint.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hi. Still quarter to twelve.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Right-o. Night.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Night.</p>

<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah–ah–let me have a Three Musketeers, ah,

flashlight batteries and some of this beef jerky.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Okay, got an I.D. for the liquor?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: A what? Oh, sure– Oh nuts, I left it–I left
it in the car.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Sorry, you’ll have to get it before–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, I can’t. I also ah, forgot the car.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hey, did ya get it? Ya get it, ya get

<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You got it. You got it!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You didn’t get it. Why didn’t you get

<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ah, well, I needed some things and I thought
as long as I was in there– look, Debbie, can you loan me a dollar?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What? Are you for real? Come on. Girls don’t
pay. Guys pay.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, well, see–I’ve only got a fifty and he
doesn’t have change.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well, I can’t believe this… I really cannot
believe this. Here.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hi–excuse me. I was wondering–could you,
ah–</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Buy you a bottle of booze. Yeah, I know. You
lost your I.D. What kind do you want?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Gee, that’s terrific. Ah, just some ah–Old
Harper.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s Freddy Benson’s Vette… he got his head
on with some drunk. Never had a chance. Damn good driver, too. What a
waste when somebody gets it and it ain’t even their fault.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Needs a paint job, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That Vette over there. Walt Hawkins, a real
ding-a-ling. Wrapped it around a fig tree out on Mesa Vista with five
kids in it. Draggin’ with five kids in the car, how dumb can you get?
All the ding-a-lings get it sooner or later. Maybe that’s why they
invented cars. To get rid of the ding-a-lings. Tough when they take
someone with them.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You never had a wreck though–you told me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I come pretty close a couple of times. Almost
rolled once. So far I’ve been quick enough to stay out of here. The
quick and the dead.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I bet you’re the fastest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve never been beaten–lot of punks have
tried. See that ’41 Ford there? Used to be the fastest wheels in the
valley. I never got a chance to race old Earl. He got his in ’55 in the
hairiest crash ever happened around here. He was racing a ’54 Chevy,
bored and loaded, out on the old Oakdale Highway and every damn kid in
town was out there. The Chevy lost its front wheel doing about 85. The
idiot had torched the spindles to lower the front end and it snapped
right off. He slammed bam into the Ford and then they both of them
crashed into a row of cars and all those kids watchin! Jesus, eight kids
killed including both drivers, looked like a battlefield. Board of
Education was so impressed they filmed it. Show it now in Drivers
Education, maybe you’ll see it. Anyway, since then street racing’s gone
underground. No spectators, I mean. Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’d love to see you race.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on! None of that.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Whadaya mean? I’m the one who’s supposed to
say that. Whadaya afraid of? I’ll keep it above the waist.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Funny… Who knows, in a few years–but not now,
bunny rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Bunny rabbit! Oh brother, you are such a
drip.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, open the door.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: If you say “Carol’s not a bunny, she’s a foxy
little tail.”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Carol’s not a rabbit, she’s a foxy little
tail.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You say the cutest things.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Sneakin’ around with the Wolfman, Baby.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Oh, this is gonna strike a raw nerve, mama.
Here’s the Platters.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Whadaya doin’, creep?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, I’m talking to the other fifty creeps here.
You know Gil Gonzales?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Gil Gonzales… no.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Don’t know Gil… you oughta. You really
should.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah… why?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No reason… he’s a friend of ours… and that’s
his car you’re sitting on.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, where ya goin?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No place. Not going any place.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ya must be going someplace–I mean ya left here.
Bring him over here, Ants, I want to show him something.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Here–bend down, look here. See that? Right
across there–see?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I guess so–yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You scratched it, man. Where do you get off
sitting on Gil’s car, huh, man?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s not much of a scratch. I don’t
think he’ll even–</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It ain’t the size that’s in question here. It’s
the principle. Jeez, this is tough… what should we do with ya?</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: Tie him to the car and drag him.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: That’s funny Hey, you guys know Toby Juarez?
He’s a Pharoah, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Toby Juarez. Yeah, sure we know Toby.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: He’s a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Sure, good old Toby. He’s a friend of yours.
That’s cool… we all hate his guts.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Oh–well, I don’t know him that much
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We killed him last night.</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: Tied him to a car and dragged him.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: This is going to take some thinking. You better
come with us maybe. Go riding with the Pharoahs…</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, I don’t think I can–I gotta–</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I know just how ya feel.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Shotgun!</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: No, I called it!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: Before we picked you up.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You can’t call it for the whole night, man.
I got it now. Get in the back.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Who is this on the Wolfman telephone?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hello, Collect…</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Pardon me. Your name is Colette?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Yes. Collect Call.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Your name is Colette Call?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sir, this is the Operator.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Are you French, Operator?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: This is a collect call for Wolfman
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: I… I love you, Operator.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Is this Wolfman Jack?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Is Floyd there?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: It’s for a Wolfman… Jack…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I just love listening to the Wolfman. My Mom
won’t let me at home. Because he’s a Negro, I think… anyway, he’s
terrific. Do you know that he just broadcasts from a plane that flies
around in circles all the time? Do you think that’s true?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Floyd, I love you, Floyd. Is this you,
Floyd? I cannot look on thee, love took my hand… and smiling did reply,
who made the eyes but I. Floyd, reach out and touch my soul.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Your party’s ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: You mean Floyd? Hello, is this Floyd?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello, is this Matilda?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: No, it ain’t honey–bye!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You tell her, Wolfman. He’s my man. When I
graduate, I’m gonna be a Wolfman. Hey, you know he broadcasts out of
Mexico someplace?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, he don’t. I seen the station right outside
of town.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: That’s just a clearing station, man. So he
can fool the cops. He blasts that thing all the way around the world.
It’s against the law, man.</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: Ah, man–they’ll never catch the Wolfman.</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: Hey, man, who cut the cheese?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: He who smelt it, dealt it. Hey, creep, scoot
down. Sitting up like that, it wrecks the lines of the car, you know
what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: There’s that badass Chevy again. Look at he
snatch he’s got with him.</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: Hey, man, he looks like a whimp.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Probably is. Whimps get all the snatch.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Milner ain’t gonna beat that. His time has
come. He’s getting old. He ain’t as fast as he used to be.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You got two seconds to get your ass over in
the corner.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Don’t worry, I won’t rape you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You got a bitchin’ car.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: In fact, we’re gonna give you our special
prize for having the neatest car around. You want me to give it to
you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If the prize is you, honey, I’m a ready
Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah, well get bent turkey.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: All right, very funny. What a chop. Ha ha.
Quit laughing!!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Let’s catch ’em at the light. Then you jump
out and flatten their tires.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, wait a–</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Just do what I say!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yezz, bozz….</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Tootie fruiti all ruti… It’s Super Cola!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s a… a little… strong, I think.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s the living end.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeaah, I guess it wasn’t mixed.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Wow, it’s pretty tonight. It’s a perfect
night to go horseback riding– I was going with a guy once who had a
horse.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh yeah? I used to have a couple of horses
myself.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I used them for hunting. I do a lot of
hunting. Deer mostly, although I got a couple of bear last year. Yep,
they were good ponies–hunting ponies. I had to train ’em special, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Do you still have ’em? We could go for a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, I had to sell ’em. To get these wheels…
and a jeep. I also have a jeep pick-up, with four-wheel drive. It’s got
a gun rack. And I use that for hunting mostly.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Why do you kill little animals? I think
that’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, well, yeah, I figure with bears, though,
it’s either me or them… You know, I think you’re really neat.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, jeez, I’m sorry. I don’t know what got
into me–I didn’t mean to– maybe it’s the booze or something.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: There–now.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Ow–you pinched me.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Let me get my head over here–okay, now you
get up–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ow–my leg, my leg. Ow, watch it!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Ummm, I just love tuck ’n roll
upholstery.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Geez, it’s like Grand Central Station around
here. Why don’t we go someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Nah, come on. They won’t come back.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wait a minute. I got a blanket in the back.
Why don’t we go over into the field?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: All right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m thirteen, how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: I’m only fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh, boy, I love you, Wolfman.</p>
<p><strong>singers</strong>: “Wolfman Jack.”</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Oh, now we gonna do the weather for all the
valleys and the mountain tops. Gonna be hot… about 200 degrees in
Merced, 400 degrees out in Fresno, and I know we’re gonna have about 500
degrees up around the valley somewhere. You got the Wolfman Jack
Show.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hey, terrific, I love miniature golf.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I hate it.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, I don’t play that often really.
Ah–what’re we doing here then?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We’re outta gas.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: They don’t sell gas here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No… but we’re outta money, too. Come on,
Carl.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Curt.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: All right, men.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: What’re you punks doing?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hey, hi. Mr. Gordon, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Henderson–Curt Henderson? You with these
punks?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: These are my friends. We were just…</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Jeez, you guys had me scared.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Hey, you haven’t left yet?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Oh ah–no–no, I’m not–</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I mean, I’m not leaving until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Tomorrow. Well, listen, Hank Anderson’s
inside. Come in and say goodbye. You know, Hank’s the one that brought
your name up on the floor of the Moose Hall. You got the check, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: We are all proud of you, Curt. The Moose
Scholarship couldn’t have gone to a better boy. And if there’s anything
we can do, let us know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Yeah, you’ll stay in touch by letter,
won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, we’re all done out here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: All done? What–what’s he mean?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Ah, he means, we’re all done having loads of
fun out here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Oh, well…</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Wonderful. You can have all the fun you want.
This place is for fun.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yes. Yes, it is. Thank you. Thank you
both.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Good luck now.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Before I say goodbye, Curt, I want to tell you
I hope you’ll be taking along with you a little piece of this place.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I think I have.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Good. Don’t forget us.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No, I won’t forget you and you won’t forget
me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gordon</strong>: Okay. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Good-bye and good luck.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It was nice to meet yuh.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Right. What he said goes for me, too.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, you just might make it as a Pharoah yet,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Some day he’ll make a fine Moose.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I thought I heard something.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They’re porking in the weeds. No sweat.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The radio is gone… That means–the car is
gone!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh no!!! OH NO!!!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh God–I’m sorry. But, why the car? You could
have struck us with lightning or something–anything— but not the
car!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You know, it doesn’t make sense to leave
home to look for a home, to give up a life to find a new life, to say
goodbye to friends you love just to find new friends.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What? Say that again, I didn’t–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: That’s what Curt said.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, figures. You must’ve talked his ear off
trying to get him to stay.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: That’s not true. I didn’t say anything. Curt
just said at dinner tonight he realized there was no big hurry. He
thought he should take it easy for a while, go to J.C. and try to figure
out what he wants to do with his life.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That sounds logical.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure. I think Curt’s probably right for Curt.
Not for me though. Laurie, look at me. Now you know what I want out of
life. And it’s just not in this town.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m not going to the airport tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Steve! Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s our last night together for three
months… come on.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: We’ve been through this before.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m going to miss you so much. I need
something to remember you by. You don’t want me to forget you.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s wrong? You’re just lying there.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Well go ahead, you want to.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Not like that.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: If you’re not going to remember me for
anything else, why don’t you go ahead?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You want it and you know it. Don’t be so damn
self-righteous with me. After those things you told me about watching
your brother–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’re disgusting! Get out of my car! I told
you never–</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Get out! It’s not worth it. I don’t care if
you’re leaving–now get out!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Anyway, the Goat Killer–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Let’s talk about something else.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: –Whenever he strikes, he leaves a bloody
goat’s head near the victim. Isn’t that creepy?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: They thought he went up to Stockton, but two
nights ago they found Carlie Johnson and Don White right here by the
canal all hacked to pieces and–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Who do you think’ll take the regionals
this–</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: –not only were there bloody goats’ heads,
but he had switched all the parts of their bodies around. You know
putting her arms on him and his legs on–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wait a second. Did you hear…?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You think it’s the Goat Killer?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No! I mean, no. Listen, I’ll go for help, you
stay here.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Come on, we’ll hide in the field.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Maybe if it’s the Goat Killer he’ll get
somebody and we’ll see the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t want to see the whole thing.
Especially if it’s us he–oh, why me? I’m going to look lousy with your
legs and a goat’s head and–</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Shhh–he’s stopped. I can’t see him very–I
think he’s coming this way.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, as long as he’s not–Debbie! Debbie!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Terry!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Who, me? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Steve!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Where’d you go, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, don’t go off again. Come on, let’s get
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’re you doing out here? Hey, where’s my
rod?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um, oh, did I introduce you? This is Debbie.
Debbie, this is Steve.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well, what about my car?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um… I’ts in the garage. I put it in the
garage for safe keeping. I mean… I don’t want to take any chances with
it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. It’s a good thing too. ’Cause
somebody stole our car.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Really? That’s terrible. What kind was
it?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Gee, ah, where’s Laurie, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I guess we broke up.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You broke up? Bull!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It doesn’t look like a gear shift knob.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, will ya? Give it back to me.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Well, go ahead, cream me. What’s wrong,
you’re a tough guy. Break my arm, see if I care.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I was just going to keep it for a little
while. You’re an ogre, just like my father. He won’t let me play
records, or stay out late, or anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He ah–doesn’t like you to stay out late?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No–he’s terrible. Once I was at a party that
didn’t end till late and he called the cops. Can you imagine? It was
only a little after midnight and he had the whole police force–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, where do you live anyway?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Over on Ramona, why? Oh no. Uh uh. You
thought I’d tell you where–not me, not old Carol. The night is young and
I’m not hitting the rack until I get a little action.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What do you keep lookin’ at? Who’s that? You
know him? He’s following awful close.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grab onto something.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Sorry if I scared ya, man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Takes more than that to scare me.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Where ya been hiding? Didn’t anyone tell ya I
been looking for ya?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, I can’t keep tracka all the punks lookin’
for me.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: They say you’re the fastest thing in the
Valley. But that can’t be your car, man. That must be your mama’s car.
Hell, I feel embarrassed just getting near ya.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ya should, man–you’re driving a field car.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Field car? What’s a Field Car?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Field Cars drive through the fields, dropping
cow shit all over the place to make the lettuce grow.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: That’s pretty good. Hey, I like that paint
job you got. What they call that–sorta a cross between Piss Yellow and
Puke Green, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well, you’re car’s so ugly you must have
to sneak up on the pumps to get a tank of gas.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Well, at least I don’t have to move over to
let a funeral go by, man.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Your car’s uglier than I am.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: That didn’t come out right…</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Come on, boy, prove it. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look kid, why don’t you go out and win a few
races, then come back and see me.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh, race him, you can beat him.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Hey, that’s a tough lookin’ girl you got with
you, man. What’re you doin’? Trying to pick up a few extra bucks
babysitting? Hey, Doll. Why don’t you come on and ride with me–in about
ten years?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Leave her out of this. This is just between
you and me.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Wow! He’s really fast, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. But he’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hey–any of you guys know a blonde in a white
T-Bird?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, I seen her, what about it?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I was just wondering who she is.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: She’s outta your price range, man. My brother’s
been with her and he clued me in.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Price range? You mean she’s a–</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, Thirty Dollar Sheri. Can you believe
that? Thirty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: We must be thinking of different blondes.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Hey man, don’t tell Joe what he thinks.</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: Thirty dollars ain’t much. I saw ten thousand
once. My old man had it in a suitcase. They caught him the next morning
though.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Fuzz ahead, watch it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Fuzz ahead, watch it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: At Jerrie’s Cherries. You can just barely
see the fender.</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: That’s rotten, man. Hiding like that.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: That’s shitty.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s dishonest.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We oughta do something. I got an idea. I got a
good idea.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think I’m gonna go over to Burger City.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Laurie’s probably over there.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You really think she’s got me worried about
where she is, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let me tell you something. I couldn’t care
less. Want to come along?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Yeah, I do. I do.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Make up your minds.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, thanks. U’mm. You know we got to report
the car missing.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: All right. See yuh.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. See yuh.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Why can’t we go to Burger City?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Burger City? Burger City!!? How can you think
of hamburgers when somebody stole my car.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Listen, ah–Carl, I–</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Curt.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Curt.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Despite you scratching Gil’s car, I like you.
And I know what you’d like more than anything right now. Like every guy
in town, you got the same secret dream, right?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ya want to join the Pharoahs. Huh? You can
admit it–you’d like to–but you never dreamed it could be possible, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, tonight, I’m goin’ to give you your
chance.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Okay. Now you got it? I’m stayin’ here. You’re
on your own.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute, Joe. What if he
hears me?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shhh. Listen. Look at it this way: Now you got
three choices. One, you chicken out. In that case, I let Ants tie you to
the car and drag you around a little bit. And you don’t want that,
right?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Two, you foul up and Holstein hears you and
well, ah… you don’t want that, right?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Three, you are successful and you join the
Pharoahs with a carcoat, and the blood initiation and all that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Wait–wait a minute. Wait a minute! What blood
initiation?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Oh, here we go baby! Here’s “Come Go With
Me.”</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hey, why don’t we go get your jeep?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You know, your jeep. The one you sold the
hunting ponies for. The one with the four-wheel drive.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Come on, Terry–Terry?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, you sure you got enough slack?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah, yeah. No sweat. Let’s get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Stand by for Justice!</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Oh, I can’t believe it. Feels so good
’cause you’re sweet sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Why are we stopping here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Carol…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I–I don’t think that I can control myself any
longer.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You can’t?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No… Carol, I’ve got to have you.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All night you’ve been sitting there and you’ve
been so sexy and it’s been so hot–and I can’t wait any more…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Well–well, a lot of that’s an act, you know.
Like… like my crying. It was just an act.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, it’s been building up inside of me like
a volcano, all night. Maybe if I knew where you lived I could fight it–I
could take you home–but since you won’t tell me, and since here we
are–I’ve got to have you. It’s too late–</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s not too late! It’s never too late! 231
Ramona–two three one–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Two three one–</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’ll show you! It’s easy to find.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: Hi. You mind if I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hi Budda. No, have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: I got five minutes outa the rat race, and I
saw you all alone. For a change.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: Where’s Laurie?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: I thought the two of you’d be going strong,
this being your last night and everything–</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We broke up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: Wow… what happened?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Nothing. We were out at the canal and… we had
a fight.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: Nothing. Just thinking. A girl like Laurie–I
mean, she goes to school and is cute and popular and all, but we’re not
so different. We know what we want. I’ve seen her after you for two
years now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: Maybe not. She does have a different
approach. Hers is “Never surrender,” me I lay down my arms at the drop
of a hat–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Budda, you got an hour left, let’s get on
it.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: All right, relax… old fart. Listen, I’m off
in an hour. If you wanta come over, my girlfriend’s away for the
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: Why don’t you? I never got a chance to talk
to you. You’re leaving tomorrow. Listen, I gave up a long time ago, so
it’d be just for fun. No problems.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: I’ll see ya later then.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Budda, Budda wait.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I gotta get up early and–I just don’t think
it’d work out.</p>
<p><strong>budda</strong>: She’s got you so brainwashed–well, hell. Some
day I’m gonna win. Don’t ya think?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh mother, it’s been a glorious night.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: That was the bitchinest thing I ever seen in
my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>ants</strong>: I seen a little kid attacked by pigs once, but
this was even better.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh boy, I’ll tell you something, that car
must’ve jumped five feet in the air!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You sure you got to go? The night’s young.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah, there’s some things I got to do. I still
want to find that blonde.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I think she was an optical delusion, man.
Psychology-wise it ain’t good to dwell on it. You’ll alter your ego or
something. Anyway, catch ya tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Guess so? Man, we don’t admit a lot of guys to
the Pharoahs. You understand we’re going to have to swipe your jacket
and all–you gotta make up your mind.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hey–I’ll see you guys.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Sure–listen, remember, Rome wasn’t buried in a
night.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: My, my, my. You only got five minutes left,
if you want to talk to the Wolfman. Gonna make all your dreams come
true, baby.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wolfman…</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Would you dedicate a record to keep me and my
girlfriend together?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Are you separated?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, see, we’re havin’ a little problem.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: I’ll bring you right together. Hold on a
minute, man. Hi ya, hi ya, hi, hi, hi. Everything’s gonna be all right
now, man, you understand? Now, let me play the record for you.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Hey Hey Hey, baby, what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Just don’t say anything and we’ll get along
fine.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This the first time you’ve been quiet all
night.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I had fun. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Do you like me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. I like you. You’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: But I mean, do you like me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I, ah… I like you. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Couldn’t I have something to remember you
by?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ’Bye, kid.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Gee, thanks. It’s just like a ring or
something.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s like we were going steady. Wait’ll I
tell Marcia.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wait a minute, now.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Wait’ll I tell everybody.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t go overboard with this thing.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Well, I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: I haven’t cried so much. And the tears and
everything, man… I leaned down towards the microphone and I almost
shorted myself out.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hold that up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ve been thinking–maybe you’re right. Why
should I leave home to find a new home. Why should I leave friends that
I love to find new friends?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute. I’ve heard this
already. Aren’t you the one who for eight weeks has been telling me you
have to leave the nest sometime?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I realize that. I realize–</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No–no realizing. You’ve been telling me all
summer that it’s time to pull your head out of the sand and take a look
at the big, beautiful world out there. Gimme this thing.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t know–I–</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I feel like a mid-wife.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I guess I was wrong. I may have been
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Wrong nothing. You’ve been talking about
getting out of this town for eight weeks. And now–goddamnit!– you’re
just–you’re just mentally playing with yourself. If you can just relax,
we’ll talk about it at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Where are you going? It’s awfully early in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I have a dental appointment.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Come on, Curt…</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Just relax, wil ya? I’ll see you at the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I never seen a guy lose so much. He mustn’t
have been used to drinking.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh no, he really likes to drink. He told
me.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Gettin’ late… I knew a man once who got
this sick. Billy Webber. That was ten years ago. What do you think that
was there, that he had for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Staying on his hands and knees like that…
He looks like a dog, doesn’t he? Looks like old Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Sicker than a dog, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ohh rats, I feel like– Wait a second…
hey!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s–oh my god–it looks like Steve’s car.
Look, right here under our– it’s my car. My car. We found it. Look!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Maybe we oughta call the police.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Never get here in time. I got a better idea.
We’ll just steal it back. See if you can find some wire around. We only
need a foot to hot-wire it… okay?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Took the header plugs off. Expectin’ some
action?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Think so. There’s some punk lookin’ for
me.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Why the hell do they bother? You’ve been
number one as long as I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah… it’s been a long time, ain’t it? I’ll
see ya. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Who is this on the Wolfman telephone?</p>
<p><strong>big bopper</strong>: Hellooo, baaaby–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ah, hi–this is my car. What I mean is,
somebody stole my car–I mean I lost my car and I want to thank you two
guys for–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: –for returning–I mean finding it. I mean,
listen now, listen guys– I’ve been sick recently, and this kind of
activity can really be hard on a guy. Now, easy will you? Easy!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Stop it, stop it, stop it! Help! Police! You
creeps!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Go, John!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hit him!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, man, you all right?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. I’ll die soon and it’ll all be
over.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Wow–you’re just like the Lone Ranger.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Listen, are you with the Toad, or were
you with them?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re talking to the woman I love…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What happened, man?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hi, Karen, Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi, Steve. Have you seen Laurie lately?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well, we have.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh yeah. So what?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So nothing. She was just with a really cute
guy in a boss car. We wondered who he was.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We do. His name’s Bob Falfa.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Help… I mean, I want two cherry cokes with
lots of ice. Never mind, forget the cokes, just bring the ice,
pronto.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Out! OUT!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I need the car–now.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m about to find out.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I don’t believe it! You practically get
killed trying to get your car back, then you let him have it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s not my car.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well, where is your car?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You don’t–no car at all. What about your
jeep?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: No car… well, how am I going to get
home?</p>
<p><strong>car hop</strong>: Where’s your car? I gotta hook ’em to your
car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s wrong, Toad? You lose the car
again?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No… Steve took it.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: It’s a shame, Baby. I’ll tell yuh… Got to
take it easy when you’re drivin’ that car of yours. You got to cruise
easy, baby. Don’t be doin’ any accidents or anything on me.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You know, I had a pretty good time
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh come on, you’re just–</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: No, no, really. I really had a good time. I
mean, you picked me up and we got some hard stuff and saw a hold-up, and
then we went to the Canal, you got your car stolen, and then I got to
watch you gettin’ sick, and then you got in this really bitchin’ fight…
I really had a good time.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You think so? Yeah–well I guess I have pretty
much fun every night.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Anyway if you’re not doing anything tomorrow
night, why don’t you come over?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah–well, I might be busy, you know. But we
could–well, I got a little Vespa I just play around with.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Really? Why that’s almost a motorcycle. And
I just love motorcycles.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I got to go.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yeah, who is it?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: It’s–I want to talk to the Wolfman.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The Wolfman ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I know, but I got to get in touch with him. I
got something to give him before–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We don’t take no deliveries after eight. Come
back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No, I can’t. I want to ask him something
that–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dedications by phone is Diamond 75044.
Wolfman Top 40 is Box 13, Chula Vista. Wolfman Sweatshirts is Wolf
Enterprises, Bakersfield. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Listen, I got a right to talk to him. I
listened to him every night for as long–for twelve years almost. I know
him and it’s personal and it’ll only take a minute and I bet Wolfman
would be upset if he knew a friend couldn’t get in touch with–</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Pull the red switch.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I’m looking for a girl.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Aren’t we all. She ain’t here. Come on back
to the booth.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hey, have a popsicle. The ice box just
broke down and they’re meltin’ all over the place. You want one?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No. Thanks. Listen, ah…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Have a popsicle.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Are you the Wolfman?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: No, man. I’m not the Wolfman.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Who is this on the Wolfman’s telephone?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Diane.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: How’re you doin’, Diane?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: That’s the Wolfman.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: He’s on tape. The man is on tape.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Do you love me? Say you love me, Diane.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, ah–where does he work? I mean, where is
the Wolfman now?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The Wolfman is everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: But I got to give him this note.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Here, let me see the note. Hell, that’s
just a dedication. All I gotta do is relay it. And it’ll be on the air
tomorrow, or Tuesday at the latest.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No, no. See, this is very important. I may be
leaving town tomorrow, and it’s very important that I–damn it, that I
reach this girl right now.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You don’t know whether you’re gonna leave
town or not?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Well, I’m supposed to go to college back East
tomorrow. And I don’t know if I’m gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Wait a minute. Have a popsicle.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sit down a minute.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Listen, it’s early in the morning. Now, I
can’t really talk for the Wolfman. But I think if he was here he’d tell
you to get your ass in gear. Now, no offense to your home town here, but
this place ain’t exactly the hub of the universe, if you know what I
mean. And well–I’ll tell you this much–the Wolfman does come in here now
and then, with tapes, to check up on me, you know, and when I hear the
stories he got about the places he goes. Hell, here I sit while there’s
a big beautiful world out there, don’t ya know. Wolfman comes in last
time talking about some exotic jungle country, handing me cigars he says
was rolled on the naked thighs of brown beauties. The Wolfman been
everywhere and he seen everything. He got so many stories, so many
memories. And here I sit sucking on popsicles.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Why don’t you leave?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well, I’m no kid anymore. I been here a
long time. And the Wolfman– well, the Wolfman gave me my start and he’s
sorta become my life. I can’t leave him now. Gotta be loyal to the
Wolfman, you understand.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I tell you what. If I can possibly do it
tonight, I’ll try to relay this dedication and get it on the air for you
later on.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: That’d be great. Thanks. Really.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sorry, sticky little mothers ain’t they?
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Wolfman…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, John, let me go with you. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Naw, man. I can’t take you when I’m racin’
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ah, come on. Just let me go. So I can watch.
Or, I’ll flag you, okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All right. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Paradise Road.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: All right now, where’s this Paradise
Road?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You just follow this street straight out of
town… Listen, if you’re gonna race John Milner, you can let me out right
when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Why don’t you shut up, baby? You ain’t said
one word all night long. What a weird broad. But you’re gonna appreciate
me soon. You’re gonna be hangin’ on for mercy, when I get this sucker
rollin’.</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: You heading out to Paradise Road?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Paradise Road, I’m not–</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: Some guy named Falfa going up against
Milner.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: John’s racing Falfa?</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: Yeah. Figured something was up, saw them going
out of town real cautious and then–</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: I got a dedication here that’s for a friend
of the Wolfman–a special friend of the Wolfman who’s leaving town
tomorrow and wants me to play the next song for a blonde young lady in a
Thunderbird. A white T- Bird, you understand? Now my friend’s named Curt
and he wants to talk to you out there, baby. So you meet him at Burger
City, or phone Diamond 3132. Now he’s a friend of mine, you hear, and,
little girl, you better call him, or the Wolfman gonna get you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey–Laurie, what in the hell are you doing in
there? Is she gonna ride with you?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Mind your own business, John.</p>
<p><strong>falfa</strong>: Yeah, she’s with me. You worry about
yourself, man.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Everybody ready?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You stupid sonofabitch, she was in that car!
Why did you have–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I said I didn’t–you lousy greasy jerk! You
coulda killed me–what’s wrong with you. You clubfoot…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No, no, no. Please, don’t come near me. No,
please. I think I’m gonna be sick. Oh, Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Laurie, please.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh, Steven! Oh, Steven, please, don’t leave
me. Don’t leave me, Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I couldn’t bear it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, before she blows.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jeez, did you show him! He’ll probably never
even get in a car again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He was faster.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It was beautiful, John. Just beauti–
what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was losin’, man.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He had me, man. He was pullin’ away from me
just before he crashed.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You saw it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, you creamed him, from right off the line.
The guy never had a chance.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shit, Toad. The man had me. He was beating
me.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: John, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. That guy, he might as
well get a wheelchair and roll himself home. Man, you got… you got the
bitchinist car in the Valley. You’ll always be number one, John. You’re
the greatest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look at your glasses, man. Okay, Toad. We’ll
take ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll take em… let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jesus, what a night.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Hello, hello, hello!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Curt?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah… this is Curt, who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who were you expecting?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Do you drive a white T-Bird?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A white ’56. I saw you on Third Street.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: You know me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Of course!</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Who are you? How do you know me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s not important.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: It’s important to me. You’re the most perfect,
beautiful creature I’ve ever seen and I don’t know anything about you.
Could we meet someplace?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I cruise Third Street every night. Maybe I’ll
see you again tonight.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: No… I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I’m leaving… in a couple of hours. Where are
you from?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Curt…</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: What’s your name? At least tell me your
name?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Goodbye, Curt.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Wait a second! Wait a second!</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Little kiss on your ear. Good night,
sweetheart. I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah, same to you. And I better see you there
next year.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh yeah, I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: ’Bye ’bye, Curt.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: So long, guys.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, stay cool, man.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ah–don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: I’ll see ya, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know, you probably think you’re a big shot,
goin’ off like this–but you’re still a punk.</p>
<p><strong>curt</strong>: Okay, John. So long.</p>
