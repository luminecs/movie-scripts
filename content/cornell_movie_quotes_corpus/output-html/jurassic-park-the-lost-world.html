<p><strong>isla sorna</strong>: 87 miles southeast of Nublar</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bowman</strong>: Cathy! Don’t wander off!</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bowman</strong>: What about snakes?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: There’s no snakes on a beach. Let her have
fun, for once.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Please be quiet, please be quiet please be
quiet…</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Well, hello there!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bowman</strong>: Cathy, sweetheart! Lunch is ready!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The hurricane seemed like a disaster at the
time, but now I think it was a blessing, nature’s way of freeing those
animals from their human confines. Of giving them another chance to
survive, but this time as they were meant to, without man’s
interference.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Thank you, John. Mr. Ludlow?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: These pictures were taken in a hospital in
Costa Rica forty-eight hours ago, after an American family on a yacht
cruise stumbled onto Site B. The little girl will be fine, but her
parents are wealthy, angry, and very fond of lawsuits. But that’s hardly
new to us, is it? Wrongful death settlements, partial list: family of
Donald Gennaro, 36.5 million dollars; family of Robert Muldoon, 12.6
million. Damaged or destroyed equipment, 17.3 million. Demolition,
de-construction, and disposal of Isla Nublar facilities, organic and
inorganic, one hundred and twenty-six million dollars. The list goes on,
gentlemen – research funding, media payoffs. Silence is expensive.</p>
<p><strong>board member</strong>: I second the motion, Mr. Chairman,
Please poll the members by a show of hands.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: All those in favor of InGen Corporate
Resolution 213C, please signify your approval by raising your right
hand.</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re him, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The guy. The scientist. I saw you on TV. I
believed you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I was misquoted. I was merely speculating
on the evolutionary scenario of a Lost World. I never said I was in any
such place.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
calling?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ian Malcolm</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Not an animal lover?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Ian! Don’t linger in the doorway like an
ingenue, come in, come in!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Resentful.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: When you have a lot of time to think, it’s
funny who you remember. It’s the people who challenged you. It is the
quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning. I never
told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I didn’t know you – weren’t well.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: It’s the lawyers. The lawyers are finally
killing me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They do have motives. Why did you want to
see me? Your message said it was urgent.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: You were right – and I was wrong. There!
Did you ever think you’d hear me say that? Spectacularly wrong. Instead
of observing those animals, I tried to control them. I squandered an
opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives. Not
their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the
wild. Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any
paleontologist. I could have had it, but I let it slip away. Thank God
for Site B.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Well? Didn’t it all seem a trifle compact
to you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: The hatchery, in particular? You know my
initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that’s a
thousand embryos for every single live birth. Genetic engineering on
that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory
I showed you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor. We built it
first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, no, no, no, no, no . . .</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: After the accident at the park, a hurricane
wiped out our facility on Site B. We had to evacuate and leave the
animals to fend for themselves. And they did. For four years I’ve fought
to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and
document them.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you out of your mind? I still have
nightmares, my reputation’s a joke, my leg is shot – you think I need
more of that?</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: It would be the most extraordinary living
fossil record the world has ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: I’ve been putting this together for over a
year.</p>
<p>****: I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone
numbers, contact people. They won’t believe you about what they’re going
to see, so don’t bother trying to convince them. Just use my checkbook
to get them there. I’ll fund your expedition through my personal
accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave
immediately. If we hesitate, all will be lost.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: John . . .</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: You’ll need an animal behaviorist, someone
with unimpeachable credentials. I believe you already know Sarah
Harding. She’s got theories about parenting and nurturing among
hunter/scavengers I bet she’d be dying to prove on a scale like this. If
you convince her to go, it’ll be a major coup. When she publishes, the
scientific community must take it seriously.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Your documentation, you should use forensic
photographic methods, Hasselbladt still cameras, high definition video.
When the trick photography analysts take your evidence apart, make it
impossible for them to say there was enhancement or computer graphic
imaging. Oh, this is very important – avoid the island interior at all
costs. Stick to the outer rim. Everything you need to know can be found
there. Vindication lies on the outer rim.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not going, John.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Ian, you are my last chance to give
something of real value to the world. I can’t walk so far and leave no
footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it. I will not be
known only for my failures. And you will not allow yourself to go down
in history as a lunatic. You’re too smart. You’e too proud. Dr. Malcolm.
Please. This is a chance at redemption. For both of us. There’s no time
to equivocate, we must seize it now, before –</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Hello, Uncle John. Dr. Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Find someone else.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: So, you two were just, uh, telling old
campfire stories, were you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do me a favor. Don’t pretend for a second
that you and I don’t know the truth. You can convince Time magazine and
the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: You signed a non-disclosure agreement before
you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing
anything you saw. You violated that agreement.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You cost me my livelihood. That on which I
relied to support my children.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: If your university felt you were causing it
embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I
am to–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I didn’t tell anything, I told the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: You version of it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There are no versions of the truth! This
isn’t a corporate maneuver, it’s my life.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: We made a generous compensatory offer for
your injuries.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It was a payoff and an insult. InGen
never–</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I
will jealously defend its interests. People will know what I want them
to know when I want them to know it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you have a satellite phone?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Ajay?</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: That cheap aftershave I send you every
Christmas, you actually wear it. I’m touched. Sit down, sit down, what
brings you to Mombassa?</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: You. Tell me, Roland, when was the last time
you answered your phone?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: I got a call from a gentleman who’s going to
Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he’s to be believed, it’s a most, uh,
unique expedition. And very well-funded.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Well, I’m a very well-funded old son of a
bitch. You go.</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: But alone? We always had great success
together, you and I.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Just a little bit too much, I think.</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: A true hunter doesn’t mind if the animal
wins. If it escapes. But there weren’t enough escapes from you and me,
Ajay. I’ve decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.
Maybe I just feel too close to it my–</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Is that supposed to be an insult?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: I can think of none greater.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Buzz off, you silly old bastard.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What do I have to do to pick a fight with
you, bring your mother into it?</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Are you kidding? I could take you with one
arm tied down.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: I mean my arm.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Sorry. We were saying?</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: You broke that idiot’s jaw for no reason other
than your boredom. Tell the truth, Roland. Aren’t you even interested in
knowing this expedition’s quarry?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Ajay. Go on up to my ranch, take a look
around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could
possibly be of any interest to me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hyenas. Ace Face is the striped snout.</p>
<p><strong>makena</strong>: Closer?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>makena</strong>: But the view would –</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No cliffs. F1 headed sough, F2 and F5
flanking, twenty yards. F3 center. F6 circling wide east. Can’t see
F7.</p>
<p><strong>makena</strong>: Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: F8 circling north. F1 straight through,
disrupting. Herd moving, stamping. There’s F7. Straight through. F8
angling through from the north.</p>
<p><strong>makena</strong>: Dr. Harding.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Brooding behavior in evidence at the kill
site, pups are ushered forward and adults help them eat, pulling flesh
away from the carcass and–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We leave in twenty-four hours. Five member
team.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Eddie Carr’s handling all our equipment and
he’ll be there to maintain it. He’s designing special field trailers
now, top of the line mobile research units.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, no, look at the plans, Henry, you can’t
place that strut laterally, it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Sorry, Eddie! Specs say it can’t deform at
12,000 PSI, we had to test it</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Any damage?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Minimal.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: “Minimal” is too much. It has to be light,
it has to be strong –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why
not, it’s only impossible. God save me from academics.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You are an academic.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Former academic. Now I actually make things.
I don’t just talk.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You think I’m all talk, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It doesn’t matter what I think.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is there anything we’ve forgotten? Anything
at all?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Hi, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Kelly! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Vacation. I’m all yours. You didn’t forget,
did you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an
hour. You only have to stay with her one night, she’ll put you on a bus
in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get
there.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I don’t even know this woman.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Well, I do, and she’s fantastic. She’ll
take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.
You’re going to have a fantastic time.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Stop saying fantastic. Where are you
going?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can’t tell you. But I’ll be back within a
week.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: My vacation is over in a week.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’ll make it up to you this summer. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I’m your daughter all the time, you know. Not
just when it’s convenient.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say
that?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a
while.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is that kid still bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You know, at the bus stop. With the
hair?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: That was about a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Well, is he?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: No. Richard talked to his parents.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That Richard.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I could come with you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Out of the question. You’d miss the
gymnastics trials. You’ve been training for that for a year.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I don’t care about the trials, I want to be
with you. I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: This is nothing like Austin. Forget about
it.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You like to have kids, you just don’t want to
be with them, do you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not like you wan me to be. I’ve what I
can be.</p>
<p><strong>juttison</strong>: Couldn’t – we just – airlift – into the –
island?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
Helicopters are too disruptive. These aren’t piles of bones you’ll be
studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they live, they breathe, and they
react!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So what’s your story, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years,
been freelance since ’91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That must be interesting. What drew you
there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Women. ’Bout eighty percent female in
Greenpeace.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Very noble of you. You don’t think you’re
bringing that thing onto the island, do you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, I wouldn’t want to spook the woolly
mammoths.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You think this is all a joke?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, please. How am I supposed to keep a
straight face when – – Johnny Cash here tells me I’m going to Skull
Island?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian’s a very good friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He doesn’t need a friend, he needs a
shrink.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I believe in him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, there’s only one reason any of us are
here. His check cleared.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Drop the cynical pose. You can’t pull it off
while playing Donkey Kong.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Be back in three days, but keep the
satellite phone on and your radio tuned to the frequency I specified in
case we need you sooner.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ve lived around here all my
life, these islands are completely –</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Listen. I know you all have probably
concluded that I’m out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Lindstradt air rifle. Fires a subsonic Fluger
impact-delivery dart.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is there an antidote?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?
Wouldn’t matter. You’d be dead before you realized you’d accidentally
pulled the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: – my –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – God!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
infraorder Stegosauria, suborder Thyreophora. Length, adult male,
estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That was a pair bond! A family group, even,
long after that infant was nestbound!</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: I want to see the nesting ground!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Lone nest – not colonial. I don’t see an egg
clutch…</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: The empty shells are crushed and trampled.
The young stay in the birth environment, that’s conclusive!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Not without a shot of the nest.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s gutty.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: She’s nuts.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian, you’re not insane! I’m so glad!</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Dr. Malcolm – the world – owes you an
apology.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No more smoking. We leave no scent of any
kind. No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags. We
will observe and document, but we will not interact.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s a scientific impossibility, you
know. Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Whatever you study, you also
change.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What should I call this? “Jurassic Pork?”</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And let’s forget about the high hide. We
can’t do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the
field, as close to the animals as possible.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: I’m not surprised stegosaur lived in a
family group, but there’s never been anything in the fossil record to
prove the carnivores did.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why wouldn’t they? Look at hyenas, jackals,
nearly all species of predator birds –</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: That doesn’t say a thing about T-rex, they
could have been rogues. Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’ve got to see one to find out. Is there
any –</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: – way we could safely –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: A campfire?!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No! Water mixes the smoke billow, use
dirt!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Who the hell started a campfire?!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh … man.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You know you were putting yourself in a
potentially dangerous situation, but you didn’t bother to find out how
dangerous before you leapt in. You don’t have the faintest idea what’s
going on on this island!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for
curiosity? Where do you think she gets it?</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Do you have chromium tapes? The others fog
in high-</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: -humidity, I know. Highest lead density on the
market.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’ve got a lot of heavy marching ahead of
us. I’m not carrying anybody.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I can keep up.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re going home. I’m sending a radio call
for the boats. We’ll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school
vice-principal.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m her father.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Sure, now.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you see any family resemblance here?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You can’t stay, Kelly, that’s it. It’s too
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If it’s so dangerous, why’d you bring any of
us?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You’re wrong, Dad. I do know what’s going on
on this island.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How could you possibly?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Because you said so. Maybe nobody else
believed you, but I always did.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The kid scores with cheap sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian, if we recall the boat now, we’ve made
two invasive landings in one day. That’ll have to go in any paper I
write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were
contaminated. You know the academic world as well as I do, once they
smell blood in the water, you’re dead. Our presence has got to be one
hundred percent antiseptic. That means if we bend a blade of grass, we
bend it right back the way it-</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You were saying something about
antiseptic?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Welcome to your dream come true,
Dr. Burke.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I believe the large herbivores forage in open
plains, like bison, which would explain the great variety of heat dots
we’re reading in the flatlands around this waterhole. Right – here.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Then that’s where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hadrosaurus! Carinthosaurus! Maiasaurus!</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: This is as good a place as any for base
camp. First priority is the laser barriers, I want them all up and
running in thirty minutes. Half an hour, understand?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Cancel that, Dieter.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you
want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: You heard his, Dieter. Find a new spot. And
remember, we’re after herbivores only – no unnecessary risks.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Peter, if you want me to run your little
camping trip, there are two conditions. First – I’m in charge, and when
I’m not around, Dieter is. Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we’re
doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.
Second condition – my fee. You can keep it. All I want in exchange for
my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male. Buck
only. Why and how are my business. If you don’t like either of those
conditions, you’re on your own. Go ahead and set up your camp right
here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care. But
I’ve been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more
suicidal ideas. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Good lad.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Pachycephalosaurus!</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Carnivore?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Huh? No! No, herbivore, late Cretaceous. Very
unusual plant eater, see that distinctive domed skull? That’s nine
inches of solid bone.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Just get them out of the way, Dieter.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Dieter. This is a round-up, not a war. Use
your powers of persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Come on, come on, don’t have all day!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: See, the pachy’s neck attaches at the bottom
of its skull instead of the back of its head, as with reptiles.</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: Roland.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Which is perfect for absorbing impact.</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: It matches the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: It certainly does.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: To collect my fee.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Ajay.</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: Do you wish to go where the animal has been,
or where the animal is?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us about these guys,
Ian?!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Because I didn’t know! I don’t have the
faintest idea what they’re doing here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ruining everything, that’s what they’re doing.
You could choke on the diesel smoke already!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if
we’re trailing along in the wake of an army.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: “InGen.” What’s InGen?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Where does it say that?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: On the side of that one truck.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: InGen is a genetics corporation, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is that who we’re really working for?! Gene
splicers?!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No! We’re an independently funded
expedition.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Funded by whom?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: John Hammond.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: But he’s the head of InGen!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You gotta be kidding. You dragged me out of
Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge? You couldn’t get anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Yeah, what have you done, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’d better keep moving, or we’ll lose
them.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What are you doing to me, John?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: It’s the rex nest.</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: Make a blind here? Wait for the buck to
return?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he
comes back, he’ll know we’re here before we have a chance. The truck
–</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Turn that off!</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Easy – easy – not too close! Full
extension!</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Next case.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Carinthosaurus – compsognathus –
triceratops – pachycephalosaurus – or small scavengers only.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ludlow. That’s why Hammond was in such a
hurry for me to get here. He knew they were coming.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Heights, I can’t help it. Put your arm here,
will you?</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They want their money back. To InGen, this
island is nothing more than a bed investment.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: We should get back to base camp. Eddie’s
waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can’t believe Peter Ludlow’s running all
this.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He isn’t. Check out the guy walking past the
fire.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Well, if that’s true – the man in charge
just left camp.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then this is our chance.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Our chance to do what?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know these guys, but I know ’em. I’ve
seen ’em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of
nuclear waste in the North Atlantic. They’re all the same. They spray us
with water cannon when we try to stop ’em, sink our boats, and then call
us crazy.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why, Nick. You are a tree-hugger.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’ no reason for name calling.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp
right away. Leave the other car for us and we’ll meet you there in an
hour or so.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What are you guys gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to
do.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Offering a little incentive.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: What kind of gun is that?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: My father’s .600 Nitro Express. Made in
1904. Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.
8700 foot pound striking force.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: How close do you have to be?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it’ll
take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Why not just use a scope and a poison dart
and snipe him from a hill?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Or a laser beam from a satellite?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: You rally think this’ll draw the parent?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: I once saw a bull elephant die charging a
jeep. All the jeep had done was startle the bull’s calves. I saw a
lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to
its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Killing lessons? Heartwarming.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Rex won’t be any different. It’ll come.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: You’re kidding yourself. An adult T-rex
cares about one thing – filling its own belly. It acts the way people
wish they could, that’s why everyone’s fascinated by it. If people had
the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would
–</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: I hadn’t planned on bringing carnivores back
because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never
occurred to me – You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What the hell you do that for?!</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Had to. To keep him still for the trip.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: You’ve broken its leg!</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: We’ve got to transport it seven thousand
miles. Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hang on. We may encounter some turbulence.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: If you’re really interested in infants, we’ll
have better luck at the seaside, because the sands offer a cushioning
surface where the egg clutches can – can –</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What in God’s – !</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Last time I leave you in charge.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sick bastards.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: What in Christ’s name is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Isn’t it obvious?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Nick, thank God, we didn’t know if –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wait, don’t —</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Do we have anyone up there?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: ?!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It has a broken leg!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So do it a favor and put it out of its
misery!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No! Get in the car before they hear us!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian, close the window, it’s going to wake
every predator in the jungle!</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: There they are!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What is that they have with them?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: This is exceedingly unwise.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Too late to worry about that! Hold him
together, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Just do whatever you have to do and get it
out of here as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Okay, there’s the metatarsals – tibia, fibula
– there it is! See it? That’s a fracture, just above the epiphysis.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That little black line?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That little black line means death for this
infant. The fibula won’t heal straight, so the ankle joint can’t pivot
when he stands on his hind feet. The baby won’t be able to run, and
probably can’t even walk. It’ll be crippled, and a predator will pick it
off before it gets more than a few weeks old.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Can you set up?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It has to be temporary, something that’ll
break apart and fall off as the animal grows…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Think fast, Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What are they doing? Why don’t they
hurry?!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Give me the radio.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Give it more morphine!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’ll kill it with too much, we’ll put it
into respiratory arrest! I’m almost done. Damn it, I need another
adhesive, something pliable I can –</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sarah, come in!</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: It’s moving. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hold it down, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m trying!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a
syringe! Quick injection of antibiotics and I can get it out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do they want?!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do you think they want?!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s impossible, they can’t have the
sensory equipment to track it all the way here!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Current evidence seems to be to the
contrary, wouldn’t you say?! GIVE IT</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free
as the grass grows –</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you insane?!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I swear to God, it works with lions
sometimes! There we are – your baby is free –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: They’re going back into the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thank God. Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Wait there. I’ll come up in a minute. Don’t
move, understand?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Note to Dr. Juttson – Tyrannosaurus rex does
nurture its young.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s, uh – there’s an unwritten rule when a
news crew is in a war zone. You stop the van every two miles and decide
whether or not to go on. Whether or not you feel lucky. One “no” from
anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked,
nobody embarrassed. Well? Do we go on? Immediately:</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: All right. I’m satisfied with the evidence
we have right now. I feel vindicated. John Hammond will too. Do you have
enough to publish?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They will come after me. But I can collect
some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick’s tapes, and the rest of you
to back me up, it should stand when we get back.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Then the only thing left to do is make sure
we do get back. I’ll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have
them send the boat right now. This expedition is over.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What the hell is he sorry f-</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They’re pushing us!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They’re pushing us over the cliff.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: OH… GOD … please…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Nick! Grab the phone!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hang on – hang on –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Catch!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re sliding!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Climbs up if you can!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, God. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you all right?! Anything broken?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I’m fine, I’m fine, I was scared, I thought
you, are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m fine… I’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: That’s what you think.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Trespassing, sabotage – you could go to jail
just for being here, did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t start a legal argument with me, this
island isn’t your property, and neither are these animals!</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: What are you doing here, Burke? There’s no
TV cameras, what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the classroom.
I am amazed.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you looking for a problem?</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Everyone, keep your voices down!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Back off, Dieter.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Listen to me, by moving the baby rex into
our camp, we changed the adults’ perceived territory!</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Their what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: That’s why they persisted in destroying the
trailers, they now feel they have to defend this entire area! We’re not
safe here.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Thanks to you people.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hey, we came here to observe, you came here
to strip-mine the place! It’s a looter mentality, all you care about is
what you can take.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: None of that matters. Our communications
equipment’s been destroyed. If your radio and satellite phone were in
those trailers that went off the cliff, and I’m guessing by the look on
his face –</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: If we can’t stay in the rex’s territory, we
have to move tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Move where? Our boat’s not coming for two
days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send –</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: There’s a communication center, here, in the
old worker village. Hammond put in some kind of renewable power source
replenishing. It may still work. If we could get there, we could send a
radio call for the airlift.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How far is the village?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: I said if we could get there.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, how far is it?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: A day’s walk, maybe more. That’s not the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: The velociraptors.</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: What are velociraptors?</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Carnivores. Pack hunters. About six feet
long, three or four hundred pounds, and very, very fast.</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: I think we can handle ourselves against
them.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No. I’m quite certain you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Look, we have two choices. We can hike back
down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to
a heavily used water source while we’re waiting for your boat to arrive,
or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we
can call for help.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We’d never make it past the raptors. Trust
me, I have some experience in this matter.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: That may be. But you weren’t with me at the
time.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You ever heard of Gambler’s Ruin?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: A statistical phenomenon. Says everything
in the world goes in streaks. It’s real, you see it everywhere – in
weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.
Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad. Bad things cluster. They go
to hell together.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Feeling a bit blue, are we?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Just – flawed. Very deeply flawed.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Why did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So that others would know about this
place?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Why should they?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Because it exists.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: It’ll still exit if they go on not knowing,
won’t it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes. And people will live in the absence of
truth.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: So the truth is more important to you than
your life?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t care about my life. But if I’d ever
thought for a second that she would be in danger –</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: She yours?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Somewhere on this island, there exits the
greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must
take him down.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: You remember that guy, about twenty years
ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came
down almost dead. And they asked him, “why did you go up there to die?”
And he said “I didn’t. I went up there to live.”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s called self-testing. But in your case,
it sounds more like self-destruction. A uniquely human characteristic.
In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think
that’s our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that
kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution
proceed to his next phase. Maybe death and destruction are our job,
maybe we’re supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing
that-</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Tell you what. You can see whatever you want
to, to me, but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else
in the group. I’m fighting panic, and you push the wrong buttons.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I don’t think – my dad doesn’t think we’re
going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Your dad is wrong. About a lot more than he
knows.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think you should call a break.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Another half hour.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Some of them won’t make another half hour. We
didn’t come this far to start dropping in the middle of the jungle. If
you don’t call it, I will.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: I can’t believe you’re still angry about
that.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You know, it’s very easy to criticize the
first person who studies something.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: No, it’s easy to criticize sloppy research
and hasty conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You know, even if we do get those tapes back,
people are going to say it’s just another hoax. Ian Malcolm’s alien
autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot
holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the
animals. The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is
if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Wait here for me, would ya Carter?</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: It’s not polite to –</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Easy – wait – one more sec-</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Break’s over, move on!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: How long ago was this?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Seven, eight minutes.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Then he’s dead. Nobody tells the little
girl. Last thing we need is screaming hysterics.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We have to send someone to look for him!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: You go if you like, but we’re not waiting
for you. MOVE IT OUT!!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Looks like the worker village is down in
there, about a mile and a half northeast from the base of these
cliffs.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There must be a game trail, some kind of
path that goes down there.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: They’ll have to rest before we look for it.
Eat. Sleep. Two hours. Then we hit it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There you are. Your dad’s looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, come on. Go talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Why? He likes to be alone. I can stay with
you.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: You hear something?</p>
<p><strong>ajay</strong>: No. I feel something.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Get my weapon.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I gotta get down there!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Shhhh… shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Get out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: She’s okay! They’ll stay in there, she’s
okay!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Elephant grass!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: They gave up! They’re not chasing us!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: How many rounds did you find for that
weapon?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Four, counting the one in the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Don’t let it out of your hands again. Can
the kid walk?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ask her.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Can the kid walk?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I can. I can walk.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: We’re going to find a path down into the
interior of the island. Load up whatever you think you need, and I mean
need. If you can’t carry it indefinitely, don’t bring it. We’ll hit the
worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Piss.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: God help us.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I do not feel lucky.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: We made it!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The jungle. It’s always ready to
return.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Where’s the power and radio setup?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Operations building. Far end of the
street.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lava?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: The radio rig is inside. It runs directly
from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What’s he got in there?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Piss.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Don’t ask me. The guy’s completely out to
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What in God’s name would he want with-</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Tyrannosaur urine. I don’t want anything to
do with it, and neither does any other animal on this island. This
building is now demarcated as the rex’s territory. As long as you stay
in that building, you’ll all be safe until the helicopter comes.</p>
<p><strong>juttson</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: After the rex. I saw a fresh kill back in
the valley with tyrannosaur tracks all around it. If I’m not back in
time, don’t wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave
and wait.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Do you think the rex might have the infant
with it?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Possible.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: You know how to work a radio, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re going too?</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: I lost everything I came after on this trip,
but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of
Chapter 11.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You gentlemen feel you have to do this
now?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Now’s the perfect time. The animal just fed,
so it won’t stalk us for food. Predators don’t hurt when they’re not
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: CQ, CQ. This is InGen Operation Harvest Leader
to Harvest Base. Come in, please.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: We’re downwind. Good.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: We took to the rock.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Wind shift.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: It’s… behind… us.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: It’s just fed. It won’t attack unless it’s
threatened. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>ludlow</strong>: If I don’t move, I can’t shoot it.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Let it go, Peter. The animal won.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: There they are!</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: No LZ in the street, too much debris!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Check the other buildings!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ian. It’s guano.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: These formations. They’re dried –</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Birdshit?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who cares? Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Kelly?! KELLY?!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Where’s Kelly?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s with Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We can’t stay in here!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re sure as hell not going back out
there”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: This is single-wall construction! It’s just
a shack!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’ll hold!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: For sixty seconds, maybe! Look at this! You
could-</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Head for the roof!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I have to find Kelly!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think she’s with Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s too wide!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Help me push this!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s afraid to come onto the roof!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look! Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Kelly! KELLY!</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where’s Kelly?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s Ian?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Kelly! I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Give me a ladder!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We’re snagged on something!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Hang on! If I tip it hard, I can cut ’em with
the rotors!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: NO! Don’t! They’re not attacking!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Thank you. Kelly, thank God. Thank God for
you…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hello, Lex. Tim.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I’m glad you came, Dr. Malcolm</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m sorry about your grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: We were going to call you, in a few days. Tim
and I have been thinking, and we’ve decided we want people to know about
the island. About what we all saw.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: We think it’s something our grandfather would
want us to do.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Because it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I know, Lex. But even if we’re the only
ones who ever know, it’ll still be true. You see, I’ve decided that if
the world found out about what your grandfather created, it wouldn’t be
around for very long.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: But – it was real. You can’t let people go on
saying it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s the thing about reality.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you feel the cold wind blowing on your
face? That’s real.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you see the four of us, standing here
together, alive? That’s real.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And maybe that’s still that matters.</p>
