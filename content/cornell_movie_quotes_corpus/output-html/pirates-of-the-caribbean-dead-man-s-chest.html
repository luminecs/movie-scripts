<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Will…!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Why is this happening?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I don’t know. You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I think it’s bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Governor Weatherby Swann, it’s
been too long.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: His Lord now… actually.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: In fact, I do. Mister Mercer!
The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Oh, is it? That’s annoying. My
mistake. Arrest her.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: On what charges?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Ah-ha! Here’s the one for
William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is
he present?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: What are the charges?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: I don’t believe that’s the
answer to the question I asked.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Lord Beckett! In the category of
questions not answered…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: We are under the jurisdiction of
the King’s governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are
charged with.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named
Jack Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Captain Jack Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I
thought you might.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest. Yo ho ho,
and a bottle of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho
ho, and a bottle of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Sorry, mate.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Mind if we make a little side trip? I
didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Not quite according to plan.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Complications arose, ensued, were
overcome.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: You got what you went in for, then?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Mm-hmm!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as
well, were expecting something a bit more… shiny. What with the Isla de
Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure
with it.</p>
<p><strong>leech</strong>: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the
Atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And the hurricane!</p>
<p><strong>crew</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: All in all, it’s seems some time since we did
a speck of honest pirating.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Shiny?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye, shiny.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Is that how you’re all feeling, then?
Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Awk! Walk the plank!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: What did the bird say?</p>
<p><strong>leech</strong>: Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Know that don’t do no good.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: It does me.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s a key!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No! Much more better. It is a drawing
of a key.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Gentlemen, what do keys do?</p>
<p><strong>leech</strong>: Keys… unlock… things?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: And whatever this key unlocks, inside there’s
something valuable. So, we’re setting out to find whatever this key
unlocks!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No! If we don’t have the key, we can’t
open whatever it is we don’t have that it unlocks. So what purpose would
be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don’t have,
without first having found the key what unlocks it?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: So - We’re going after this key!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You’re not making any sense at all.
Any more questions?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So… Do we have a heading?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Hah! A heading. Set sail in a… mmm… a
general… in that way - direction.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Cap’n?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Come on, snap to and make sail, you
know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, ?oy/?quick, hey!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Have you noticed lately… The captain seems to
be actin’ a bit strange… -er.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Settin’ sail without knowing his own headin’?
Somethin’s got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack
Sparrow bodes ill for us all.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Those won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: The East India Trading Company
has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a
business transaction with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: More acquaintance than friend. How do
you know him?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: We’ve had dealings in the past.
And we’ve each left our mark… on the other.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What mark did he leave on you?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: By your efforts Jack Sparrow
was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain
property in his possession.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Recover. At the point of a sword?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Bargain!</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Letters of Marque. You will
offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in
the employ of England.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Freedom. Jack Sparrow is a
dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank pages of the map filled
in. Jack must find his place in the new world or perish. Not unlike you,
Mister Turner. You and your fianc�e face the hangman’s noose.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: So you get both Jack and the Black
Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: The Black Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: The property you want that he
possesses.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: A ship? Hardly. The item in
question’s considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow
keeps on his person at all times. A compass. Ah, you know it. Bring back
that Compass, or there’s no deal.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Why is the rum always gone?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh! That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: As you were, gents.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Bootstrap. Bill Turner.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Is this a dream?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I thought not. If it were, there’d be
rum.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Your son.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: And to what do I owe the pleasure of
your carbuncle?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Ah. So it’s you, then. He shanghaied
you into service, eh?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: It’s funny what a man will do to
forestall his final judgment -</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Technic -</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already
has a captain, so there’s re -</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Any idea when Jones might release said
terrible beastie?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt
gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty, I want movement!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I want movement!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Lift the skin up!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: All on deck! Run! And keep running!
Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Do we have a heading?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh! Euh!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Which port?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Didn’t say port. I said land. Any
land.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Agh!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Jack’s hat! Bring ’er about!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No no! Leave it! Run!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Back to your stations! The lot o’ ya!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what’s coming after us?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>turkish fisherman</strong>: Heh-heh-heh.?tupayHey! ?Fo ?pes
?sa ?kapazun kapitan ?de ?la ?mezande, huh?</p>
<p><strong>greek fisherman</strong>: ?Etora.</p>
<p><strong>greek fisherman</strong>: Ah! ?Vangas ?da ?eroro ###</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Here now. He can’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Mister Swann, -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Jack’s Compass. What does Beckett
want with that?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Does it matter? I’m to find Jack and
convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange the charges against us
will be dropped.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in
me?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I have faith in you. Both of you.
Where will you find him?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Tortuga. I’ll start there, and I won’t
stop searching ’til I find him. And then I intend to return here, to
marry you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Properly?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Eagerly, if you’ll still have me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: If it weren’t for these bars I’d
have you already.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I’ll wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Keep a weather eye on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>weathered sailor</strong>: Captain Jack Sparrow? Owes me four
dubloons. Heard he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>half-blind fisherman</strong>: Singapore. That’s what I
heard. Drunk with a smile on his face. Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow…
will turn up in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>giselle</strong>: Jack Sparrow!</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I haven’t seen ’im in a month.</p>
<p><strong>giselle</strong>: When you find him, will you give him a
message?</p>
<p><strong>shrimper</strong>: Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere’s
a island, just south of de straits, where I trade spice for… mmm…
delicious long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But you find a ship dere. A
ship wit’ black sails.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: beach</p>
<p><strong>shrimper</strong>: My brother will take you ashore.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What’s wrong? The beach is right
there.</p>
<p><strong>shrimper’s brother</strong>: ?: Ne bougeais pas, c’est trop
dangereux.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shrimper’s brother</strong>: ?: Je ne peux, c’est trop
dangereux, j’avais le dit. Bon voyage, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack! Jack Sparrow!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Marty! Cotton! Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Awk!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Ah! A familiar face!</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Rawk! Don’t eat me!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I’m not gonna eat you.</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Don’t eat me! No! Don’t eat me!
Akkk!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Gibbs.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Euh! Unh! Ya! Come on! Let’s go! Euh!
Ya! Come on! Who wants it? Unh! I could do this all day! Euh! Euh!
Hah!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: throne</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack? Jack Sparrow! I can honestly say
I’m glad to see you!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack! It’s me! Will Turner!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: ?: Wa-say kohn.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal crowd</strong>: Eeseepi.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Tell ’em to let me down.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Kay-lay lam. Lam piki-piki. Lam eensy
weensy. Lam say-say… eunuchy. Snip-snip.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal crowd</strong>: Ahhh… eunuchy!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack! The Compass! That’s all I need,
Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help you. She
faces the gallows!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Say-say lam shoop-shoop sha
smalay-lama shoo-koo. Savvy? Ball licky-licky.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal crowd</strong>: Ball licky-licky!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal crowd</strong>: ?Boom-shoo-boom, ?boom-shoo-boom,
?boom-shoo-boom…</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Save me!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack, what did you tell them? No! What
about Elizabeth? Jack…!</p>
<p><strong>prisoners</strong>: …we don’t bite…Come on…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Why don’t you tell me what’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: No! Will has gone to find Jack!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: He’s a better man than you give him
credit for.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: A fair trial for Will ends in a
hanging.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: Evening, Governor. Shame, huh? He was
carryin’ this. It’s a letter to the King. It’s from you.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>port royal</strong>: EITC headquarters</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: No doubt you’ve discovered that
loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father
believes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Then what is?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: I’m afraid that currency is the
currency of the realm.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I expect then that we can come to
some sort of understanding. I’m here to negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: I’m listening intently.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: These Letters of Marque, they are
signed by the King?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Yes, and they’re not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Or else I would not still be here.
You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do
you no good.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Do explain.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I have been to Isla de Muerta, I
have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Ah, I see. You think the
Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate. But you mustn’t worry. I care not for cursed Aztec
gold. My desires are not so provincial. There’s more than one chest of
value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your
offer.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: So I did. A marriage
interrupted. Or fate intervenes. You make great efforts to ensure Jack
Sparrow’s freedom.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: These aren’t going to Jack.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Oh really. To ensure Mister
Turner’s freedom, then? I’ll still want that Compass. Consider that in
your calculations.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Well I say it was divine providence what
escaped us from jail.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: And I say… it was me bein’ clever. Ain’t
that right, poochie?</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: ?: Well how’dya know it ?weren’t/?wasn’t
divine providence what inspired you to be clever? Anyways, I ain’t
stealin’ no ship.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: It ain’t stealin’. It’s salvagin’! And since
when did you care?</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Since we’re not immortal no more. We gotta
take care of our immortal souls.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: You know you can’t read.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: It’s the Bible. You get credit for
trying.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Pretendin’ to read the Bible’s a lie! That’s
a mark against ya! Look! There it is!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: What’s got into ’im?</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Must’ve seen a catfish.
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Stupid mongrel!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: beach</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Come on! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha…
###</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: It’s ours for the taking!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Tide’s comin’, that should help. Well,
salvagin’ is saving, in a manner of speaking.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: There’s the truth of it! ###</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Suppose we be’er… save it as soon as we
can. What with our souls in such a vulnerable state, and all.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Amen to that.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: throne</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: cages</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Why would he do this to us? If Jack is
their chief.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief.
But he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: So he had no choice. He’s a captive
then as much as the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Worse… as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form, and they intend to do him the
honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: ?Argh! They’ll roast him and eat him.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Where’s the rest of the crew?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: These cages we’re in… weren’t built ’til
after we got here.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: The feast is about to begin. Jack’s life will
end… when the drums stop.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Well, we can’t just sit here and wait
then, can we?</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: throne</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: ?No/?Oup! No no! ?Oy!/?Wait! No no!
More wood! Big fire! Big fire! I am chief! Want big fire! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: ?Oy!/?Boy! Maboogie snickel-snickel.
Tout de suite! Come on! More wood!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: Jack</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh bugger.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Little seasoning. Eh?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: cages</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Put your legs through, start to climb!
Agh!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Come on men! It’ll take all
?of-us/?the-rest to crew the Black Pearl!</p>
<p><strong>leech</strong>: Actually, you won’t need everyone. ’Bout six
would do! Ohhh… dear.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>leech</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>?will turner</strong>: ?Move!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: throne</p>
<p><strong>cannibal crowd</strong>: Ahhh! Fye-fye!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Well, go on! Go get them! Hay ala!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal crowd</strong>: Hay ala!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No! No no! Oy! No no!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: cage</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Cut it loose! Find a rock!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Roll the cage!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Lift the cage! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Come on, men! Lift it like a lady’s
skirt!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: hut</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: cage</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: This way, lads!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: Jack</p>
<p><strong>?cannibal boy</strong>: Da litozo! Da litozo!</p>
<p><strong>cannibal woman</strong>: ?A-geev-nee. Uh-boogie?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Bugger.</p>
<p><strong>cannibal island</strong>: beach</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: ?Pull-loose/?Unloose the mooring lines! The
mooring lines!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: ?Thief/?Thing! Little hairy ?thief/?thing!
Give it back! Don’t bite it!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: ?Unloose the mooring lines!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: He’s got me eye! He won’t give it back!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Well, how’d you get it back last time?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Excellent work! Work’s half done!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: We done it for you! Knowin’ you’d be comin’
back for us.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: ?Make/?Making ?ready ?to?sail/?cast-off ###,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What about Jack? I won’t leave without
him.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Cast off those lines!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Good doggie! ?Doggie.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Alas, my children! This is the day you
shall always remember as the day that you almost -</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: …Captain Jack… Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Let’s put some distance between us and this
island, and head out to open sea.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Yes to the first, yes to the second,
but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Uh, that seems a bit contradictory,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I have every faith in your
reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that
monkey? I want to shoot something.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Elizabeth is in danger.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Have you considered keeping a more
watchful eye on ’er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: She is locked up, in a prison, bound to
hang for helping you!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: There comes a time when one must take
responsibility for one’s mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I
must trade it for her freedom.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Mister Gibbs!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Cap’n.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: We have a need to travel upriver.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: By need, d’you mean a… trifling need, ?uh/?a…
fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No, a… resolute and unyielding
need.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What we need to do is make sail for
Port Royal with all haste.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: William… I shall trade you the
Compass, if you will help me… to find this.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: You want me to find this?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No. You want you to find this. Because
the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and
your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle
ol’… what’s-her-face. Savvy?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: This… is going to save Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: How much do you know about Davy
Jones?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Yeah, it’s gonna save Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: What’s all this? If you both fancy the
dress, you’ll just have to share, and wear it one after the other.</p>
<p><strong>bursar</strong>: It’s not like that, Sir. This ship is
haunted.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: Is it now? ‘N’ you?</p>
<p><strong>quartermaster</strong>: The… female presence… amongst us,
yes… all the men… they can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>bursar</strong>: I say… that we throw the dress overboard,
and we hope the spirit finds it.</p>
<p><strong>quartermaster</strong>: No! That - that will just anger the
spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and
then just get it back!</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: Enough! Enough! You’re a pair of
superstitious goats and it’s got the best of you. Now this appears to be
no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it.
I want you to search the ship and find ’er. Oh, and uh… she’s probably
naked.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Why is Jack afraid of the open
ocean?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Well, if you believe such things, there’s a
beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant
tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past
the crushing darkness. The Kraken!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: They say the stench of its breath is like -
ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God’s green earth is the roar
of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If
you believe such things.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: And the key will spare him that?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Now that’s the very question Jack wants
answered. Bad enough even to go visit… Her.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Her?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>bayou</strong>: Tia’s shack</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go
way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been.
Before.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: I’ll watch your back.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: It’s me front I’m worried about. Mind
the boat.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Mind the boat.</p>
<p><strong>?will turner</strong>: Mind the boat.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Mind the boat.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mind the boat.</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Awk! Mind the boat!</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Jack Sparrow!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Tia Dalma!</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: I always know de wind was goin’ blow you
back to me one day.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: You. You have a touch of… destiny about
you, William Turner.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: You know me?</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: You want to know me.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: There’ll be no knowing here. We’ve
come for help and we’re not leaving without it.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I thought I knew you.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Not so well as I had hoped. Come.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: What… service… may I do you? Hmmm? You
know I demand payment.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I brought payment.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: An undead monkey! Top that!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: No! You’ve no idea how long it took us to
catch that.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: The payment is fair.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: We’re looking for this. And what it
goes to.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: The Compass you bartered from me. It
cannot lead you to dis?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Maybe. Why?</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Ayeee… Jack Sparrow does not know what he
wants! Or… do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go
to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: What is inside?</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a
valuable nature?</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Nothing… bad, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: You know of… Davy Jones, yes? A man of de
sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What vexes all men?</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: What, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: The sea?</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Sums!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Dichotomy of good and evil.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: A woman.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: A wo-man. He fell in love.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: No-no-no-no, I heard it was the sea he fell
in love with.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Same story, different versions, and all
are true. See, it was a woman, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as
the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause ’im was too
much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What… exactly did he put into the
chest?</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Him heart.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Literally, or figuratively?</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: He couldn’t li’erally put his heart in a
chest! Could he?</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: It was not wort’ feeling what… small
fleeting joy life brings, and so… he carved out him heart, lock it away
in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at
all times.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: You knew this.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I did not. I didn’t know where the key
was. But now we do. So all that’s left is to climb aboard the Flying
Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie
lass, hey!</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Let me see your hand.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Uhhh! The black spot!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: My eyesight’s as good as ever, just so
you know.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: I am justMy little ###, where are you?
###</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step
on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack
Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you…</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Is the… jar of dirt going to help?</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: If you don’ want it, give it back.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Den it helps.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: It seems… we have a need to find the
Flying Dutchman.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: A touch… of destiny!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: That’s the Flying Dutchman? She doesn’t
look like much.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Neither do you. Do not underestimate
her.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Must’ve run afoul of the reef.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: So what’s your plan, then?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I row over, search the ship until I
find your bloody key.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: And if there are crewmen?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I cut down anyone in my path.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I like it. Simple, easy to
remember.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha,
ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Hey! If you do happen to get captured,
just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your
life!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Douse the lamps.</p>
<p><strong>scuttled ship</strong>: before attack</p>
<p><strong>wounded sailor</strong>: …up the…</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Sailor!</p>
<p><strong>wounded sailor</strong>: …the stench…capsized…</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Sailor!</p>
<p><strong>wounded sailor</strong>: …bring a…</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: There’s no use. You’ve run aground.</p>
<p><strong>wounded sailor</strong>: No! Beneath us! Foul breath!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>greenbeard</strong>: Down on your marrowbones, and pray.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Get back! Back!</p>
<p><strong>scuttled ship</strong>: after attack</p>
<p><strong>maccus</strong>: Five men still alive. The rest have moved
on.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark
abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer
you… an escape-uh.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: Don’t listen to him!</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Do you not fear death?</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: I’ll take my chances, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: To the depths.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife
be any different? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the
judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve?</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: I - I will, serve.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: ?Grand.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: You are neither dead nor dying. What is
your purpose here?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his
debt.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: What is your purpose here?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his
debt.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Huh! Did he, now? I’m sorely tempted to
accept that offer.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: You have a debt to pay. You’ve been
captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our
agreement.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Technically, I was only captain for
two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Then you were a poor captain, but a
captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as
Captain Jack Sparrow?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You have my payment. One soul to serve
on your ship is already over there.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: One soul is not equal to another.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Aha! So we’ve established my proposal
is sound in principle, now we’re just haggling over price.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Price? Pttt!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Just how many souls do you think my
soul is worth?</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: One hundred souls, three days-uh.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You’re a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy, I’ll get started right off.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: I keep the boy. A good-faith payment.
That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Have you not met Will Turner? He’s
noble, heroic, terrific soprano. Worth at least four… maybe three and a
half. And did I happen to mention… he’s in love. With a girl. Due to be
married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him… would only
be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony.
Aye?</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh.
But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an
innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name
while you roam free?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Yep! I’m good with it. Should we seal
it in blood? I mean… mm-mm - ink?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Uh!</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Three days. Three days.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh, Mr. Gibbs.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: And how do you intend to harvest these
ninety-nine souls in three days?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Fortunately, he was mum as the
condition in which these souls need be.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Ah… Tortuga!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Tortuga.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: It’s an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing
fees, wharf handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work
for the East India Trading Company, then?</p>
<p><strong>quartermaster</strong>: I’m afraid, Sir… Tortuga is the only
free port left in these waters.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: A pirate port is what you mean. Well, I’m
sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep
well each night, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bursar</strong>: S-S-Sir!</p>
<p><strong>bursar</strong>: She wants you to… do something.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: She’s tryna give a sign.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: Over there! Look for a sign!</p>
<p><strong>quartermaster</strong>: Look there! There it is. There’s the
sign.</p>
<p><strong>?bursar</strong>: That’s seaweed.</p>
<p><strong>quartermaster</strong>: S-Seaweed can be a sign.</p>
<p><strong>?bursar</strong>: Looks like entrails.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: What’s that over there?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: And what makes you think you’re worthy to
crew the Black Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Truth be told, I never sailed a day in
me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I’m still
young.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: You’ll do. Make your mark. Next!</p>
<p><strong>jilted man</strong>: My wife ran off with my dog. And I’m
drunk for a month. And I don’t give a ass rat’s if I live or die.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Perfect! Next!</p>
<p><strong>one-armed man</strong>: Me have one arm, ‘n’ a bum leg.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: It’s the crow’s nest for you.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I know what I want.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>romantic man</strong>: Ever since I was a little lad, I’ve
always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.</p>
<p><strong>romantic man</strong>: Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: How we going?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Including those four? That gives us -
four!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: And what’s your story?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: My story… it’s exactly the same as your
story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas.
The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Commodore?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: No, not anymore, weren’t you listening?
I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the…
hurricane.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Lord. You didn’t try to sail through it?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: So do I make your crew, or not? You
haven’t said where you’re going. Somewhere nice!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: So am I worthy to serve under Captain
Jack Sparrow?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Or should I just kill you now?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You’re hired.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Sorry. Old habits and all that.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Time to go?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Thanks, mate.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Carry on.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an
orderly line, I’ll have you all one by one. Come on, who’s first?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I just wanted the pleasure of doing
that myself!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: James Norrington. What has the
world done to you?</p>
<p><strong>bo’sun</strong>: Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!</p>
<p><strong>bo’sun</strong>: Step ?to-it/?tight!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Step aside!</p>
<p><strong>bo’sun</strong>: ?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself!</p>
<p><strong>bo’sun</strong>: Haul that weevil to his feet!</p>
<p><strong>bo’sun</strong>: Five lashes to remind you… to stay on
’em!</p>
<p><strong>bo’sun</strong>: Impeding me in my duties. You’ll share the
punishment.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Will you now? And what would prompt such
an act of charity?</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous
circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: The cat’s out of the bag, Mister Turner.
Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo’sun’s hand, by your own.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Bo’sun!</p>
<p><strong>bo’sun</strong>: You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I don’t need your help!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: So I’m to understand what you did was
an act of compassion?</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: below deck</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I’ve sworn no oath.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Not until I find this. The key.</p>
<p><strong>wyvern</strong>: The deadman’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What do you know of this?</p>
<p><strong>wyvern</strong>: Open the chest with the key, and stab the
heart. No-no-no-no. Don’t stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living
heart, or there’ll be no captain. And if there’s no captain, there’s no
one to have the key.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: So the captain has the key.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Where is the key?</p>
<p><strong>wyvern</strong>: Hidden.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Where is the chest?</p>
<p><strong>wyvern</strong>: Hidden.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Captain Sparrow!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I’m here to find the man I
love.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I’m deeply flattered, son, but my
first and only love is the sea.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Meaning William Turner, Captain
Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Elizabeth. Hide the rum.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You know, these clothes do not flatter
you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress
in my cabin.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Jack. I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to
tell you this but… through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable
series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor
William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones’ crew.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Davy Jones?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Oh, please. The captain of the Flying
Dutchman.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You look bloody awful. What are you
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: You hired me. I can’t help it if your
standards are lax.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You smell funny.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Jack. All I want is to find
Will.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Are you certain? Is that what you
really want most?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: ’Course.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Because I would think, you’d want to
find a way to save Will the most.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: And you have a way of doing
that?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Well, there is a chest…</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: A chest of unknown size and
origin.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: What contains the still-beating heart o’
Davy Jones.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Unh-unh… unh-unh… unh-unh…</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: And whoever possesses that chest
possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she
wants, including… saving brave William from his grim fate.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: You don’t actually believe him, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: How do we find it?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: With this. My Compass… is unique.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: “Unique” here having the meaning of
broken.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: True enough. This Compass does not
point north.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Where does it point?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: It points to the thing you want most
in this world.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Oh Jack! Are you telling the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Every word, love. And what you want
most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: To save Will?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: By finding the chest of Davy
Jones.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Mister Gibbs!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Cap’n.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: We have our heading.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor,
and prow that canvas!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Miss Swann.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: ###</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Welcome to the crew, former Commodore!
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh…</p>
<p><strong>port royal</strong>: EITC headquarters</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: There’s something to knowing
the exact shape of the world and one’s place in it, don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: I had you brought here because
I thought you’d be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga,
then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. And other
fugitives from justice.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Including the previous owner of
this sword… I believe. Our ships are in pursuit. and justice will be
dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces
of metal. I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the
horror facing all those on board.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Your authority as governor,
your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading
Company.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Shall I remove these
shackles?</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept. Even for what he hopes never to
sell.</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: deck</p>
<p><strong>maccus</strong>: I wager… ten years.</p>
<p><strong>?koleniko</strong>: I’ll match ten years.</p>
<p><strong>greenbeard</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: It’s a game of deception. Your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What are they wagering?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: So any crewman can be challenged?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I challenge Davy Jones.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: I accept ?that-uh.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: The stakes?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: My soul. An eternity of servitude.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Against?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I want this.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: How do you know of the key?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: That’s not part of the game, is it? You
can still walk away.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: No! Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Four fours.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Four fives.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Seven fives-uh.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Eight fives.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew,
liar.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: And be called a liar myself for my
trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you’re a liar and you will spend an eternity on
this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore… the very next time we
make port!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Fool. Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: It was never about winning, or
losing.</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: organ room</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: deck</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: It’s not a fate you had to choose for
yourself, either.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: They’ll know you helped me.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I take this with a promise. I’ll find a
way to sever Jones’ hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces
his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Beckett!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Yes, they’re signed, Lord Cutler
Beckett of the East India Trading Company.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Agh.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Will was working for Beckett, and never said
a word.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Agh.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason
for that.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Of course. He wants the chest.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Yes, he did say something about a
chest.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: If the company controls the chest, they
controls the sea.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: A truly discomforting notion,
love.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: And bad. Bad for every mother’s son what
calls himself a pirate. I think there’s a bit more speed to be coaxed
from these sails. Brace the foreyard!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Might I inquire how as to how you came
by these?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Friendly?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Decidedly not.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Will strikes a deal for these and
upholds it with honor. Yet you’re the one standing here with the prize.
Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East
India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Jack, the Letters, give them
back.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: No. Persuade me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: You do know Will taught me how
handle a sword.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: As I said… Persuade me.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: It’s a curious thing. There was a time
when I would’ve given anything for you to look like that while thinking
about me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Oh, I think you do.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Oh, don’t be absurd. I trust him,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: So you never wondered how your latest
fianc� ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: Strange thing to come upon a longboat so
far out in open waters.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Just put as many leagues behind us as
you can. As fast as you can.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: And what are we running from?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: That dress. Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: It was found aboard the ship. The crew it
thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: That’s foolish.</p>
<p><strong>quartermaster</strong>: Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish.</p>
<p><strong>bursar</strong>: It brought good fortune! The spirit told us…
Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there.</p>
<p><strong>?bellamy</strong>: Off the books, of course.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I imagine… some of your crew may have
jumped ship there.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>messenger sailor</strong>: Captain, a ship’s been
spotted.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: Colors?</p>
<p><strong>messenger sailor</strong>: She isn’t flyin’ any.</p>
<p><strong>bellamy</strong>: Pirates!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Or worse.</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: deck</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: You will watch this.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man
look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready
to wake… the Kraken!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I’ve doomed us all. It’s the Flying
Dutchman!</p>
<p><strong>bursar</strong>: Oh, Mother Cary’s chickens. What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>?quartermaster</strong>: Must’ve hit a reef.</p>
<p><strong>?bellamy</strong>: Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard
to starboard!</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: deck</p>
<p><strong>maccus</strong>: The boy’s not here. He must’ve been claimed
by the sea.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: I am the sea.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: You need time alone with your
thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: There are no survivors.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: The chest is no longer safe. Chart a
course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there’ll be the devil to
pay.</p>
<p><strong>koleniko</strong>: First?</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my
ship? Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: My tremendous intuitive sense of the
female creature informs me that you are troubled.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I just thought I’d be married by
now. I’m so ready to be married.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You know… Lizzy… I am… captain of a
ship. And being captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a… marriage.
Right here. Right on this deck. Right… now!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Why not? We are very much alike, you
and I. I and you. Us.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Oh. Except for a sense of honor,
and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Trifles. You will come over to my
side, I know it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: You seem very certain.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: One word love: curiosity. You long for
freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act
on selfish impulse. You want to see what it’s like. One day, you won’t
be able to resist.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Why doesn’t your Compass work?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Uh my Compass works fine.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Because you and I are alike, and
there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the
right thing.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I love those moments. I like to wave
at them as they pass by.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: You’ll have the chance to do
something… something courageous. And when you do, you’ll discover
something: that you’re a good man.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: All evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I have faith in you. Want to know
why?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Do tell, dearie.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Curiosity. You’re going to want it.
A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won’t be
able to resist. You’re going to want to know… what it tastes like.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I do want to know what it tastes
like.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: But - seeing as you’re a good man I
know you will never put me in a position that would compromise my
honor.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: I’m proud of you, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>?gibbs</strong>: Land ho!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I want my jar of dirt.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: You’re pullin’ too fast.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: You’re pulling too slow. We don’t want the
Kraken to catch us.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: I’m savin’ me strength for when it comes.
And I don’t think it’s Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said
Kray-kin.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: What, with a long A?</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en’s how it’s
pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en’s closer to
that.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Well we ain’t original Scandinavians, are
we? Kray-ken!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: It’s a mythological creature, I can calls
it what I wants.</p>
<p><strong>isla cruces</strong>: beach</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Guard the boat, mind the tide… Don’t
touch my dirt.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: This doesn’t work. And it certainly
doesn’t show you what you want most.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Yes it does. You’re sitting on it!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Move.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: “Mind the tide.”</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: I ?can/?may join the circus!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: ?Don’t ?mind ?if I shine your shoes,
Sir?</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: deck</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: They’re here. And I cannot step foot on
land again for near of a decade.</p>
<p><strong>maccus</strong>: Then trust us to act in your stead.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: I’ll trust you know what awaits should
you fail! Down, then!</p>
<p><strong>maccus</strong>: Down!</p>
<p><strong>isla cruces</strong>: beach</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: It’s real!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: You actually were telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I do that quite a lot. Yet people are
always surprised.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: With good reason!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Will! You’re alright! Thank God! I
came to find you!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: How did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them,
strapped to my feet.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Not so easy, is it?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: But I do owe you thanks, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: After you tricked me onto that ship to
square your debt with Jones.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I was reunited with my father.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh! Well… you’re welcome, then.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Everything you said to me… every
word, was a lie!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Pretty much. Time and tide, love.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oy! What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I’m gonna kill Jones.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Can’t let you do that, William. ’Cause
if Jones is dead, who’s to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?
Now. If you please: The key.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: I keep the promises I make, Jack. I
intend to free my father. I hope you’re here to see it.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I can’t let you do that, either. So
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I knew you’d warm up to me
eventually.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Lord Beckett desires the contents of
that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Ah. The dark side of ambition.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of
redemption.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Guard the chest!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: This is bar-baric! This is no way
for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let’s just - pull out our swords
and start banging away at each other! This will solve everything! I’ve
had it! I’ve had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked… pirates!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: How’d this go all screwy?</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Well, each wants the chest for hisself,
don’t ‘e? Mister Norrington, I think he’s tryna regain a bit of honor.
Old Jack’s lookin’ to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I
figure ’e’s tryna… settle some unresolved business ’twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Sad. That chest must be worth more ’n a
shiny penny.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: If we was any kind of decent, we’d remove
temptation from their path.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Will! Enough!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Oh! Oh…! The heat!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: By your leave, Mister Turner.</p>
<p><strong>isla cruces</strong>: church</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: By your leave, Mister Norrington.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Do excuse me while I kill the man who
ruined my life.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Let us examine that claim for a
moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment
you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said
pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who’s fault
is it, really, that you’ve ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders
from pirates?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Unfortunately, Mister Turner… He’s
right!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Still rooting for you, mate!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Wup!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Woah!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: ’Ello, Poppet.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Sword!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Sword!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Sword!</p>
<p><strong>hadrus</strong>: Aya! Uh ?seech! Aunido! Aunido! Follow my
voice! Follow my voice! To the left, uh… No, to the right… Go to the
left…</p>
<p><strong>hadrus</strong>: No… That’s a tree.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh, shut it.</p>
<p><strong>isla cruces</strong>: beach</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Jar of dirt!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Come on, Turner!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on
using him to hit something with.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: We’re not getting out of this.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Not with the chest. Into the boat.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: You’re mad.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Don’t wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Uh, I say we respect his final
wish.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Aye!</p>
<p><strong>hadrus</strong>: Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the
chest away from your cold… dead… hands.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Here you go!</p>
<p><strong>hadrus</strong>: Oo!</p>
<p><strong>hadrus</strong>: Uh! ?Ando! Aunido! Aunido! Pirates!</p>
<p><strong>hadrus</strong>: ?Vengo ?kowmpenay ?lachay. Hey! ?Hovaya!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: What happened to the chest?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Norrington took it to draw them
off.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: You’re pulling too hard!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: You’re not pulling hard enough!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Where’s the Commodore?</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: He fell behind.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in
our grief. The bright side is: You’re back. And made it off free and
clear.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Lord almighty.?us.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: I’ll handle this, mate.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey?
Oup!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you
slimy git? Look what I got. I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt!
And guess what’s inside it?</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Hard to starboard.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Hard to starboard!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Brace up the foreyard!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Hard to starboard!</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Send his beloved Pearl back to the
depths!</p>
<p><strong>?pintel</strong>: She’s on us! She’s on us!</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Let them taste the triple guns.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: She’s falling behind!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye, and we’ve got her!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: We’re the faster?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us.
That’s how she takes her prey. But with the wind…</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: We rob her advantage.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: deck</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: They’re out of range! ?Break ?out ?run
###</p>
<p><strong>?marty</strong>: They’re giving up! Yay!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: My father is on that ship. If we can
outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Why fight when you can negotiate? All
one needs… is the proper leverage.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Where is it? Where is the
thump-thump?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: No. It’s not a reef! Get away from the
rail!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: The Kraken. To arms!</p>
<p><strong>?gibbs</strong>: All guns, defend the masts!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: ?It’ll ?attack the starboard. I’ve seen
it before. ?Break out the cannons and hold for my signal.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Easy, boys!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Will?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Steady! Steady.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Will?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Hold. Hold…</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: I think we’ve held fire long enough.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Will?</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Fire…!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: It’ll be back. We have to get off the
ship.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: There’s no boats.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Whatever you do, don’t miss.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: As soon as you’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: There’s only half a dozen kegs of powder!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Then load the rum!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye! The rum, too!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Step to!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Oh you coward!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: ?Pull ?away!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Heave! Heave like you’re being paid for
it!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Euh! Come on!I’m over here! Come
on!</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Did we kill it?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: No. We just made it angry. We’re not out of
this yet. Captain! Orders!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Abandon ship. Into the longboat.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Jack! The Pearl!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: She’s only a ship, mate.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: He’s right, we have to head for
land.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: ‘S a lot o’ open wa’er.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: That’s a lot o’ wa’er.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: We have to try. We can get away as it
takes down the Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon
hope.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Thank you, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: We’re not free yet, love.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: You came back. I always knew you
were a good man.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Prepare to cast off! There’s no time to lose!
Come on, Will, step to!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: It’s after you, not the ship. It’s
not us. This is the only way, don’t you see? I’m not sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Pirate.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Where’s Jack?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: He elected to stay behind to give
us a chance.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger…!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Come on… Come on…</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>jack sparrow</strong>: Hello, beastie.</p>
<p><strong>flying dutchman</strong>: deck</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled.</p>
<p><strong>koleniko</strong>: The captain goes down with his ship.</p>
<p><strong>maccus</strong>: Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the
devil.</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Open the chest. Open the chest, I need
to see it!</p>
<p><strong>davy jones</strong>: Damn you, Jack Spar-row!</p>
<p><strong>port royal</strong>: EITC headquarters</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: The last of our ships has returned.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: Is there any news on the
chest?</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: None. But… one of the ships did pick up a
man adrift at sea. He had these.</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: I took the liberty of filling in my
name.</p>
<p><strong>lord cutler beckett</strong>: If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade. D’you have the Compass?</p>
<p><strong>norrington</strong>: Better. The heart of Davy Jones.</p>
<p><strong>bayou</strong>: Tia’s shack</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Against de cold… and de sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: It’s a shame. I know you’re t’inking that
wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder’s
soul.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Doesn’t matter now. The Pearl’s gone.
Along with its captain.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye. And already the world seems a bit less
bright. He fooled us all right to the end. But I guess that honest
streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow!</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Never another like Captain Jack.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: He was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: If there was anything could be done to
bring him back… Elizabeth…</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Would you do it? Hmmm? What… would you?
Hmmm? What would any of you be willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail to
the ends of the eart’, and beyond, to fetch back ?witty Jack and ’im
precious Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>pintel</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>ragetti</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>cotton’s parrot</strong>: Awk! Aye.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth swann</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>will turner</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>tia dalma</strong>: Alright. But if you’re goin’ brave de
weird, and haunted shores, at world’s end, den… you will need a captain
who knows dose waters.</p>
<p><strong>barbossa</strong>: So tell me, what’s become of my ship?</p>
