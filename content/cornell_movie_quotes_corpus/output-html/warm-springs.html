<p><strong>ext. a body of water - late afternoon</strong>: 1 1 4</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs
are FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.</p>

<p><strong>ext. boat deck - continuous 3</strong>: 3</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh, my dear…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s all right, darling. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - morning</strong>: 5 5</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Oscar! Where the devil are you?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom - continuous</strong>: 6 6</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’ve been standing here for five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Did you sleep well, sir?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Don’t remember. That’s good, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I could not be more delighted to have
received your most charming letter. It has been far too long since we
last corresponded. However, it is with great reluctance I must decline
your kind speaking invitation…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Unfortunately, I would be of little
assistance to the Junior Assistance League. Particularly if my purpose
were to appear as an alumna who is gifted at public speaking.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: And what do you really want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Thank you and if you ask again I shall
scream?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why don’t you ask your husband for some
pointers? He’s a pretty gifted public speaker, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You should get out once in a while. Accepting
that invitation would be good for Franklin’s career.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Mr. Howe, wouldn’t you be more comfortable
waiting for my husband outside?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: If you like.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I see it’s not even eight a.m. and already
the gloves are off. Good morning, Babs. Hello, Miss Mercer. L</p>
<p><strong>ucy</strong>: Good morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You’re late. Honestly, why do you enjoy
keeping people waiting?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Because they always seem more grateful to
see me when I arrive.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Have a lovely day, Babs.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Should I expect you for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I have the Navy reception this evening.
I’ll be home quite late. Unless you’ve changed your mind about
coming?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Do you wish me to come?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Well… whatever you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Thank you, no.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Very well then. Good day, Miss Mercer.</p>
<p><strong>ext. washington, d.c. sidewalk - day</strong>: 9 9</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: At ten you’ve got a meeting with
representatives from Pittsburgh Steel. Their bid on the ship building
contract has already been turned in and is on your desk for
approval.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What did I think of it?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You had some problems with it.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I better read it. Steel workers tend to
vote democratic. Next.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lunch with Secretary Daniels.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Must I?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He’s your boss.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What if she’d said yes?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: People know. It’s time to stop.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I can handle my own affairs, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Not this one. This is Washington, D.C., not
the Harvard Club. How can you be so cavalier?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You say that like it’s a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>int. front hall - night</strong>: 10 10</p>
<p><strong>int. franklin’s bedroom - early morning</strong>: 12 12</p>
<p><strong>ext. hyde park - day</strong>: 13 13</p>
<p><strong>int. springwood - dining room - day</strong>: 14 14</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I have offered Franklin his freedom.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: And I have accepted.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: His freedom is not yours to offer!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lord save us from fools in love.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Falling in love is out of the question. Why do
you think men have mistresses? Duty. Duty to their families and their
careers.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: It’s obvious that my input in this matter
is of little importance.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Babs!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Come back here! Both of you!</p>
<p><strong>int. entry hall - continuous</strong>: 15 15</p>
<p><strong>leanor</strong>: I don’t know whether to hate you or thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: For forcing me to face my life honestly for
the first time.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I didn’t mean to hurt you, Babs.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: You never do. You live your life skimming
the surface… never aware of the attachments beneath. It must be a
luxury.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Divorce will finish your career in politics.
How do you intend to support yourself?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: My trust fund.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Divorce Eleanor and there is no trust
fund.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We’ve come so far, boss. State Assembly,
Assistant Secretary of the Navy – all pages right out of Cousin Teddy’s
play book. We’re on the road to the White House. Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>crowd noise</strong>: Rose-velt! Rose-velt! Rose-velt!</p>
<p><strong>int. democratic convention hall - san francisco -
night</strong>: 17 17</p>
<p><strong>“cox/roosevelt in ’20!”</strong>: Franklin BOLTS, running
vigorously down the center aisle of the hall lit by the circle of a
spotlight. The CROWD goes wild over this unconventional entrance.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hen he reaches the edge of the stage he LEAPS
onto it. This final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>close up - franklin</strong>: 18 18</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I humbly accept your nomination for
Vice-President!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: They say the best way to get rid of a man
is to have him run for Vice- President. You might well have asked my
cousin Teddy if that’s how they got rid of him!</p>
<p><strong>int. tea room - washington, d.c. - afternoon</strong>: 19
19</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Of course you lost. A Roosevelt on the
democratic ticket? Our ancestors are turning in their graves.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Cousin Alice, if Teddy were alive he’d be
a democrat – and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Rubbish. But I do know one thing: You’re
exactly like him. My father was born wanting only one thing: to be
President.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: And what’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Do you know what they’re saying about
you?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No, but I’m sure you’ll tell me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They say F.D.R. stands for “featherduster.”
That you’re a lightweight. A dilettante with no substance; no point of
view.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You lead with your vanity. You talk when you
should listen. Unless these are the qualities of a democrat?</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: The democratic party is the party of the
people. I am a man of the people.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Darling, you’re a Roosevelt. What do you know
about people?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Of course, I can think of one person you did
manage to find the time to invest in. A Miss Mercer, I believe?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Alice, stop.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Don’t misunderstand me, Franklin. Being
married to Eleanor I think you deserved some fun. But you made the right
decision. Especially since Miss Mercer has gone on with her life.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Edward Rutherford is a wonderful catch for a
girl like her.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: She’s married?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Last week. A small event, of course.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: When I last heard she was governess to his
children.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: And then love bloomed. As a “man of the
people,” I wouldn’t be too hard on her, Franklin. We can’t all have
trust funds you know.</p>
<p><strong>ext. staten island boy scout camp - day</strong>: 20 20</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We’re not taking this defeat lying down,
boss. We’ll run you for Governor –</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Really? Of which state?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Very funny. No, this buys you time. It buys
you experience.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What about Al Smith?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He’s vulnerable. You’re still a fresh face,
boss. We’ll use that to our advantage.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my political
base.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They’ve got parents. Besides they’re
photogenic.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Franklin Roosevelt, happy to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ouis</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p><strong>scoutmaster</strong>: Okay, boys, lunch. Line up to wash!
Will you be joining us?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Of course!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>guiseppe</strong>: Guiseppe.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo?</p>
<p><strong>guiseppe</strong>: Okay, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ext. roosevelt summer home - day</strong>: 21 21</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He’s a natural.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Vae victis!</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: aught up in his victory, Elliot doesn’t see
Franklin sneak up behind him and tackle him to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Festina lente!</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Dinner is in one half-hour! Come in and
change, children!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Up! Up, chicks! You heard your mother!</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Go wash up.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hey, boss! Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m fine. Oh, that’s pretty, Babs.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I must check on dinner.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Tired?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Of you? Never.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why don’t you nap before dinner?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yes, dear.</p>
<p><strong>int. sun room - day</strong>: 23 23</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Can you take my hand?</p>
<p><strong>ext. screened porch - day</strong>: 24 24</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He has Infantile Paralysis. Polio.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I knew it. I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: thought it only struck children.</p>
<p><strong>octor</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How did he get it?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Some experts believe it is linked to
contaminated water. But that theory is speculative at best.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It was the visit to that god damned Boy Scout
Camp!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: In all honesty you need to be looking
forward, not back.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: What is the prognosis?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lovett</strong>: The damage to his leg muscles is
extensive. I suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Dear God. And the children?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lovett</strong>: If they don’t have any symptoms by now
then they have been spared.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Then we must count our blessings.</p>
<p><strong>r. lovett</strong>: You will need to prepare yourselves.
There is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude.
I’m afraid life as he knew it is over.</p>

<p><strong>int. hyde park - parlor - continuous</strong>: 27 27</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Now that politics are out of the question he
can stay here at home with me.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: But what kind of life is that?</p>
<p><strong>ouis</strong>: I’ve rented him an office downtown. He can
still practice law.</p>
<p><strong>ara</strong>: Why would you want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Because he needs it.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: He can pursue a career, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: A man as proud and vital as Franklin… you’re
inviting him to be hurt.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Mama! That’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom - continuous</strong>: 28 28</p>
<p><strong>int. sun room - continuous</strong>: 29 29</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What kind of life is it to be pitied and

<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: What kind of life is it to be hidden away?
I know you believe that what you are suggesting for Franklin is best.
But I think you are making it harder for him.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I think I know what’s best for Franklin. I am
his mother!</p>

<p><strong>h</strong>: e lifts the sheet and visibly WINCES in disgust
at the sight of his crippled legs. BONES covered by FLESH with barely an
ounce of muscle.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Mr. Roosevelt, we got a storm comin’!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Leave me here. Let the ocean swallow me
up. Burial at sea. Perfect for a navy man.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boat - day</strong>: 32 32</p>
<p><strong>int. diner off the florida coast - day</strong>: 33 33</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I never miss Florida in the rainy season.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No letter? No wire?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why? Would you have answered it?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Good to see you too. Nice whiskers. You look
like Chester Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Stanley, this is Mr. Howe. He gets
sea-sick at the mere sight of a boat so he’s probably happy that it’s
being Ldestroyed right now.</p>
<p><strong>ouis</strong>: Boys, I need to talk to Mr. Roosevelt alone.
Find your own breakfast. Here’s a five spot. Make it a feast.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You’re always so generous with my
money.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You mean your mother’s, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: So Mama financed this fool’s errand, has
she? Well, it’s a waste of a trip.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It was Eleanor’s idea.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’d like some ham and eggs, sunny side up,
please? What’s your fancy, boss?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Nothing. I fancy nothing.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He’ll have the same.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: There are a few from your children.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I can still read.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Your wife wants you to come home. She’s
concerned. I’m concerned. This life on a boat… where is it getting
you?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Getting me? For one thing, no one gets to
see me and I don’t get to see them.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t say that. Everyone’s waiting for you to
come home. The kids… they’re aching to see you.</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: From George Foster Peabody. He owns a
resort in rural Georgia for investment purposes. Hot springs or
something. He claims that only recently a crippled boy swam in the
waters and can walk again.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh, for Chrissake…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: ” The high magnesium content of these
natural springs will hold anyone up. Although it is not a resort for
infirm types I am extending you my personal invitation to come visit in
the off- season.” I’m only welcome in the “off- season.”</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Mr. Roosevelt, we got bad news.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s the boat… it got banged up real bad
tied to the dock.</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: How bad?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t think you can stay there
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Maybe it’s a blessing in disguise,
Mr. Roosevelt. I don’t know about you, but I’m homesick.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: And I’m sick of home. Where’s the letter
from Peabody?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You can’t be serious?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Why not miracle waters? I’ve drunk the oil
of monkey glands, been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in
harnesses. After all that, this sounds downright peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can’t quite picture you in the back woods
of Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Where do you picture me, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: President, Louis? I can’t visit the
bathroom without a team of associates to help pull my pants down.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Give it a little time.</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: There’s a reason they say a man runs for
office. I’m going to Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>int. a train car - day</strong>: 34 34</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: James has been doing so much better now
that Elliot has joined him at Groton. They’ve put their differences
behind them and have become a real team.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Two peas in a pod. Last week they were both
in the infirmary with the</p>

her future – she dismisses me. I am going to have to enlist your support
in this, Franklin. She listens to you.</p>

<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Then you’d better call me Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: And this is the Misses.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Call me Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Pleased to make your acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: There’s a trunk and a chair with the wheels,
too.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll send a wagon right over.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We got a wagon, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ext. a country road - day</strong>: 37 37</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Beautiful country.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: How long have you been manager of the
Inn?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Not long.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Got any paved roads?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the meriwether inn - day</strong>: 38 38</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You’ll have a great deal of privacy. There are
only a few guests right now as it’s the off- season… I’m hoping to make
some improvements by next Spring –</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I… I can’t stay here. This place is a
wreck.</p>
<p><strong>leanor</strong>: Franklin!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look on the bright side. Most of your time will
be spent in the water. It’s true, we’ve fallen on some hard times…</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: Hard times? This is a disaster! It should
be condemned!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes, we’ve seen better days. But then I imagine
so have you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m happy to drive you back to the train
station right now, if that’s what you want.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Fire. I’m frightened of fire. I can’t get
out if I’m upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’ve got options.</p>

<p><strong>ext. cottage - day</strong>: 40 40</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - day</strong>: 41 41</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Well ventilated, at least.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Where do you want this, Mr. Roosevelt?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: The bedroom, Roy, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Tom, this young man appears quite
competent. Would you ask him if he’d like to stay on as my valet?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why don’t you ask him yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ext. driveway - day</strong>: 42 42</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - day</strong>: 43 43</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: This is madness.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No doubt.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Tell me again, Franklin, why are we
here?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: For the waters. Are you coming?</p>
<p><strong>ext. a dirt path - day</strong>: 44 44</p>
<p><strong>om</strong>: Mrs. Roosevelt want to swim?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Mrs. Roosevelt doesn’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: MOTHER, eyeing Franklin approaching in his
wheelchair,</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Mr. Roosevelt, I’d like you to meet Aunt
Sally.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Aunt Sally.</p>
<p><strong>aunt sally</strong>: Good day, sir. I have towels for
you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Now give it a minute. You’ll see that the
mineralization makes the water more buoyant. The crippled boy who swam
here was actually able to walk in the water.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I can’t even stand.</p>
<p><strong>aunt sally</strong>: Well, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cabin - night</strong>: 46 46</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin - continuing</strong>: 47 47</p>
<p><strong>int. meriwether inn - dining room - day</strong>: 49 49</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: This is simply revolting.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: It’s not very good, but it is mysterious.
What in the world do you think they’ve poured over this chicken? Or is
it possum?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: You want to stay.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: New York has the best doctors and hospitals
in the country.</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: I need something new.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: This isn’t about getting better is it? You
don’t want to come home. You don’t want to live with us.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I refuse to be a burden to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: You’re not a burden, you’re my husband.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I want to offer you the freedom you once
so generously offered me. All you’ve ever known is duty. To me and to a
political career that unless I can walk no longer exists. You’ve been
exemplary. Now I’m telling you you’re free to go.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: No. I don’t want freedom. I want a
marriage. I want a life with you.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I can’t imagine what you think that life
is going to be.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Oh Franklin… it’s not up to me to imagine,
it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cottage driveway - day</strong>: 50 50</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Howe.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I thought you might want to see a friendly
face. So how’s our boy doing?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Well, he’s enjoying the waters very much.
He… I think we’ve lost him.</p>
<p><strong>leanor</strong>: Please excuse me, Mr. Howe.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t you think it’s time you called me
Louis?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Maybe we’ve been going about this all wrong.
He’s down there to be alone so let’s give him what he wants. We change
our focus.</p>
<p><strong>leanor</strong>: To what?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: To you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cottages - sunset</strong>: 52 52</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: To your mineral pool, or whatever you call
it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Warm Springs.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Too strong?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Haven’t been in a drinking mood lately.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Actually, its the most god-awful martini I’ve
ever tasted.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Are you always this direct, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, I never tasted a martini this bad
before.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Everyone likes my martinis…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: So they say.</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - morning</strong>: 54 54</p>
<p><strong>ext. pool - morning</strong>: 55 55</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Tell me more about what that boy did, Aunt
Sally.</p>
<p><strong>aunt sally</strong>: Well, first he’d always swim over to the
side of the pool and hold himself there – make sure he righted himself.
Then… before he knew it… he’d be standing.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: If it was only that easy.</p>
<p><strong>aunt sally</strong>: Well, you make it hard. Get over to the
side of that pool and grab it.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>aunt sally</strong>: Now you got to remember how you did
it.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m standing.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m standing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cottage porch - evening</strong>: 56 56</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: To standing on your own two feet!</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: This water could be the cure – the cure! In
six months I could be up and walking!</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Evening folks.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Cocktail, Lionel?</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: I can’t. I’m working for the federal
government.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: All the more reason. Sort of late for the
mail, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Not for me it isn’t. Got a whole packet of
clippings for you, Mr. Roosevelt. From a Mr. Howe. New York Times,
Journal-American… don’t know what else.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Your mother wants to know when you’re coming
home. She says they got swimming pools in Hyde Park. She’s mad as all
hell.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Reading other people’s mail is not only
impolite, it’s illegal.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Sheriff don’t mind. He likes I read his
mail. Saves him the time. Plus a lot of folks around here can’t read, so
it’s more a public service, really.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Astonishing. Thank you, Lionel.</p>
<p><strong>ionel</strong>: “Miss Missy LeHand.” Who’s she?</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: If you must know, she’s my social
secretary. I’m having her come down.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Almost forgot… your wife wrote the nicest
letter. She’s gonna make a speech at the League of Women Voters.</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Says she’s gonna keep the Roosevelt name
alive. Least till he starts walkin’ and all.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: This is so unlike Eleanor. She’s terrified
of crowds.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: We are facing imminent disaster.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I take full responsibility if you
hyperventilate or faint.</p>
<p><strong>int. meeting room - continuous</strong>: 58 58</p>
<p><strong>chairwoman</strong>: Ah, here she is now. Ladies,
Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Good afternoon. I am so pleased to be
invited here today. Too often….</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Too often…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Too often the great decisions are
originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: So that whatever political value women have
to offer is shunted aside… without expression.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: his is a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I think this might be the reason I am
having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here
today.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I’m reminded of what someone once said
about looking at an elephant. That it is impossible to ever see an
entire elephant from one place – you must walk around it. If our elected
leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of
their way to look beyond what is right in front of them. To see the
entire elephant. And for that… they need our help.</p>
<p><strong>chairwoman</strong>: That was so moving, Mrs. Roosevelt. The
Child Welfare Amendment could use someone with your passion. You must
consider being our spokesperson.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Oh. It would be an honor.</p>
<p><strong>chairwoman</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I walked five steps today!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Congratulations. Listen, Franklin, I got word a
local reporter wants to do a story on you.</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: I’m hardly newsworthy these days. How did
he find out I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Small town – word gets out. It probably won’t
amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some
free publicity for the Inn.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: All right, I know the gentleman. I’m doing him
a favor. You know, I used to be a journalist.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Do you mean all this time I’ve been
talking to a newspaper man?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Not anymore. I got in a bit of trouble in
Atlanta. Seems some of the editorial pieces I wrote offended the
sensibilities of a local civic group. So I needed to lay low for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You mean the Klan? Good God, Tom…</p>
<p><strong>om</strong>: Thankfully, Mr. George Foster Peabody gave me
this job…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Well, that explains a few things. For the
life of me, I couldn’t figure out why someone like you was running this
–</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Rat-trap?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I was going to say dump, but rat- trap
fits nicely.</p>

60</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Now in 1920 when you were running for
Vice-President…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I can’t imagine your readers are
interested in ancient history. Cox and I lost the election by a wide
margin.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It was only a few years ago,
Mr. Roosevelt…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Now it’s the waters extra minerals plus
its warmth that makes all the difference. At 90 degrees I can work my
muscles for hours and not get cold.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: As Assistant Secretary of the Navy during
the Great War did you condone the use of…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I forgot one more thing you will need to
write down. Poor circulation is a chronic problem for people in my
condition.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: So… you think it could be a cure?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: But you’re hopeful?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yes. I am.</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - night</strong>: 61 61</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - morning</strong>: 62 62</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Therefore, a formal questionnaire should
be composed in order so we may hear from all recent delegates as to how
we can do better in ’28 to present a more united front. Signed, Franklin
Roosevelt, etc., etc.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: Very good. Do you want this out today? F</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: Tomorrow will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Thank you, Missy, and c.c. that to
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Hungry, Mr. Roosevelt?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Who do you write to every morning?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Different people I knew in politics. Just
in case they ever want me back.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: So you’ll be ready when you get your legs
workin’ again?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>prendergast</strong>: Excuse me, are you Mr. Roosevelt?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yes. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>prendergast</strong>: My name is Benjamin Prendergast. I’ve
come to see if you could speak at this year’s graduation ceremony at the
schoolhouse. You being so famous and all.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>prendergast</strong>: Would you be available?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: When? Next spring?</p>
<p><strong>prendergast</strong>: Next week. We only have a four month
school year.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>prendergast</strong>: Tax dollars only cover that much.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Are you graduating?</p>
<p><strong>prendergast</strong>: No, sir. I’m the principal.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>ext. schoolhouse - day</strong>: 63 63</p>
<p><strong>int. schoolroom - continuous</strong>: 64 64</p>
<p><strong>prendergast</strong>: Now that we’re all here let me
introduce to you to our guest speaker today, Mr. Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: At Groton, where I graduated from high
school, our beloved Headmaster encouraged his students to enter public
life…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I chose to attend Harvard for my
undergraduate work and then Columbia for my law degree.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e takes in their uncomprehending expressions.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I followed my Headmaster’s advice and
sought a career in public life. But circumstances beyond my control have
made that… very difficult…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’ve given many speeches in my life… I
don’t know why I’m having such a hard time making this one…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: My God did you see how they were looking
at me?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They welcomed your company, Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Don’t patronize me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t patronize them. These people go to bed
night after night with half-empty stomachs – your legs are the least of
their worries.</p>
<p><strong>aunt sally</strong>: Mr. Roosevelt, aren’t you cold?</p>
<p><strong>oy</strong>: Mr. Roosevelt, you’re gonna catch the chill if
you don’t get out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>aunt sally</strong>: You got to tell him, Mr. Loyless. He
won’t listen to us.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Franklin, we need to talk… Normally we close up
this time of year and the staff goes home for the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Grandmother Delano brought this from
China.</p>
<p><strong>lliot</strong>: Have you ever been to China, Father?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No, Elliot. Just your grandmama.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I adored China. It smelled of ginger
cookies.</p>
<p><strong>franklin, jr.</strong>: et’s go in the backyard and dig our
way there!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: That sounds like an adventure.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Put it on top.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Give it to James. He’s the tallest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: John, give it to him!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Papa always does it.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>int. study - later</strong>: 68 68</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: It was an extraordinary turnout this
afternoon. Louis says there were over two hundred people in the
audience.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: That’s marvelous, Babs.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’ve got you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You wonder why I want to go back to
Georgia… it’s to avoid people who look at me the way you just did.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: You truly believe the waters… … that they
are helping?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Don’t talk to me as if I were a child.
Choosing your words so carefully…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: How am I supposed to talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Like I was! Talk to me like I was!</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I don’t know how anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cottage - day</strong>: 69 69</p>
<p><strong>om</strong>: You’re a sight for sore eyes…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: We missed you at the station…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Tom, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s just an ulcer. I can’t eat anything I like
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: My father had ulcers. Damn irritating.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes, they are.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ready to swim?</p>
<p><strong>ext. pool - day</strong>: 70 70</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’ve got some new guests. Some paying, some
non-paying…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What in blazes?…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The interview you gave was syndicated in Sunday
papers all over the country.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They’re here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: Mr. Roosevelt, Pat Doyle. I’ve come all the way
from Minneapolis to shake your hand, sir.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: Stuck in this chair I do nothing but read.
Newspapers, mostly. Usually I’m just looking for something – anything –
that’ll tell me there’s even the slightest chance I’ll walk again.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I really don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: Well, you’re here. And we’re here. Together…
we’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. meriwether inn - grounds - day</strong>: 71 71</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: I want no part of this. I come here for
privacy!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This isn’t your personal spa! I have a business
to run.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Exactly. You have a business to run, not
I!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No one’s asking anything of you!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Of course they are!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Do you know what it took for most of them to
get here?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: It’s not my concern. I want to be left
alone!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: My God, you’re afraid of these people.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Afraid? What you’re talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You look at them with the same repulsion and
pity as everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous. I resent your trying
to –</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You don’t want to be around them because then
that would make you one of them, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: God damn it!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Out of my way! Get out of my goddamn
way!</p>
<p><strong>ext. bullochville train station - day</strong>: 72 72</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Right on time.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Expecting someone?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m looking for a young gentleman by the name
of Botts. Fred Botts?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Don’t know anything about that.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I expect he would be in a wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: You mean the cripple? He’s in the baggage
car.</p>
<p><strong>ext. baggage car - day</strong>: 73 73</p>
<p><strong>int. baggage car - day</strong>: 74 74</p>

<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Son, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Fred?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Mr. Roosevelt?…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: It’s going to be all right, son.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e hands Franklin a worn newspaper clipping from
his pocket. The headline reads: “FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO
HEALTH!”</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: The conductor wouldn’t let me ride in the
passenger car with my chair.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: When did you last eat?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Knoxville.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Knoxville had to be three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Roy, take him to the car.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Who in their right mind let’s a child ride
in the baggage car! You could have killed that boy.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: He had polio. Probably still
contagious.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Don’t dismiss me because I sit in this
chair!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You ignorant son of a bitch. If I could,
I’d get up right now and lock you in that box car! See how you like
it!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Franklin…</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Get this lunatic off me!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Where’s the nearest hospital?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What about a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Closer, but not by much.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Train’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - night</strong>: 76 76</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: ranklin is using his watch to take Fred’s
pulse.</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - day</strong>: 77 77</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: How many can pay?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fewer than half.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I want these people in the cottages, not
in the inn. It’s safer.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, it’s the way it has to be.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ve already had some complaints. This is the
start of the season, Franklin. I’ve got regulars who have come for
years. Healthy folks over all… They’re threatening to check out, afraid
they might catch polio.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Such ignorance! Don’t they know that after
the fever breaks we are no longer contagious?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m going to have to ask that you not use the
pool during regular hours. I’ll put time aside for you late in the day…
and it won’t be possible for you to eat in the dining room either. But I
promise I’ll find someplace suitable.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: They don’t want us to eat in their
presence?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Of course for you I can make other
accommodations.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: We still need a doctor here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: For Fred?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: For everyone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cottage - night</strong>: 78 78</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: “Dear Babs, Things are very different upon
my return.”</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I am taking on responsibilities which none
of my schooling in the spheres of higher learning or politics could have
prepared me for… I have seen the casualties of war. But I have never
seen this, a suffering so insidious, so silent, that it rattles my
soul.”</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage - night</strong>: 80 80</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: When can I swim?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Soon. When you’re a little stronger.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: When I’m asleep, in my dreams, I can still
walk.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Me too. How long has it been… since you
walked?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Nine years. I’d just learned to ride a bike.
After I got sick my mom was sure that the bike had caused it.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Did she sell it?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No. She took it out back and shot it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. pool - dusk</strong>: 81 81</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: And who is this delightful child?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Daisy.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: All right Daisy, try and kick your

<p><strong>franklin</strong>: My hope is that in repeating these
movements over and over in the water I’m in some way causing the muscles
to regenerate themselves and repair the damage.</p>

therapist. You have no idea who I am, do you?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Should I?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I wrote you a letter right after I saw the

not by me.</p>

<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Incredibly I’ve come to the same
conclusion myself.</p>

It will serve you well.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Must be all that sitting.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’m serious. Your right leg has some
movement along the thigh. That’s good because we can use it to help
extend your hip, flex your knee and rotate your tibia.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m supposed to walk on one side?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: The water may help build some strength I’m
not able to see yet. But to do that you would need to swim in the water
much of the day. Not the limited hours you have now. Why should this
place cater to a few able-bodied folk when it could be opened year round
with polios?</p>

<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I wish there was more to read. Damn few
things being written about any of this. To think of someone like Fred…
locked away… his mind and heart so vibrant…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s a waste. An awful waste.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What’s the acreage here?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Roughly twelve hundred or so. Why?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I want to buy it. I think it would make
one hell of an investment.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Investment?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Twelve hundred acres? Enough for two
resorts, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It would take money. There’s a lot of land,
rebuilding the inn, adding ramps and so many people can’t pay…</p>

that.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: Good for you, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: If you don’t mind my asking, how will people
pay for the services you are going to offer here? Most people with polio
have a hard enough time making ends meet as it is.</p>

twenty-five.</p>

We’ll go to Atlanta right now –</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ve seen the best doctors. When you were in
New York they opened me up for the second time. Now I just want to die
in the bed I was born.</p>

an identity now – a purpose. It has you.</p>

Squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers? I consider
this your fault, Eleanor!</p>

fix it up for Mr. Roosevelt.”</p>

<p><strong>franklin</strong>: A small schoolhouse will go there. We need
it badly as many of the children are barred from the local schools due
to their infirmities.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: We also require a blacksmith’s shop so we
can craft braces here on the premises. I’ve found a wonderful local man
who can make crutches and canes. His work is outstanding. Of course what
is most desperately needed is a hospital. That’s going to put my fund
raising abilities to the test.</p>

<p><strong>e</strong>: Eleanor and Louis exchange glances.</p>
<p><strong>leanor</strong>: What exactly are you proposing,
Franklin?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: That this will be the first polio
rehabilitation and treatment center in the world. My personal trust
almost covers the price of the Inn and the surrounding land. There will
be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over
while I seek out investors.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Franklin, you’re risking everything you
have…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: And there are other costs to consider.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Mama will see that the children are
provided for.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I’m not speaking of money.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I have found something here which makes
waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand
there…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Franklin, I need for you to be practical
and realistic.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Practical? I am trapped inside a body that
no longer moves of my own volition. I am trying to be practical. Now
either you’re with me or against me. In or out!</p>

How should I speak to my wife, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: With the respect she deserves. Look, I don’t
deny the work you’re doing here could be important –</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Could be?</p>

rehabilitation center or whether you want to run for office again.</p>

<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Getting a doctor to live on the premises
full-time. Someone who, at the very least, could monitor our progress.
Make us legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: And that costs more money.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: But the real problem is no one is
interested. The annual Orthopedics Convention is being held in Atlanta
this weekend and I offered to speak. They turned me down flat.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: A few weeks ago, the conditions at a
garment factory on West 27th Street were brought to my attention. The
owners claimed everything was satisfactory, but would never let anyone
in to conduct a proper inspection.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: It took awhile, but we finally got in.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I showed up with someone from the Labor
Board and we refused to leave until they let us in.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What are you suggesting?</p>

gentlemen… a miraculous place not three hours from here where the water
is filled with natural minerals at a temperature of almost 90 degrees.
That place, gentlemen, is called Warm Springs.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Patients can stay in these waters for up

<p><strong>helena</strong>: I already…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Read it!</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: “Of the twenty three patients examined only
one, a forty-four year old male, showed little visible signs of
improvement…” This is one doctor’s opinion, Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: “There is marked falling away of the muscle
masses on either side of the spine in the lower lumbar region. His lower
extremities present a most depressing picture.”</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: “I feel after studying him that the
psychological factor in his management is paramount. He has such courage
and ambition. Yet at the same time he is such an extraordinarily
sensitive emotional mechanism…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: … that it will take all the skill which we
can muster to lead him successfully to a recognition of his severe
physical limitations without crushing him.”</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Patronizing son-of-a-bitch! I wanted to
walk again.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: And you still might. This report legitimizes
we’ve worked so hard for. We can raise funs now. It could change
everything!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: It won’t change anything for me.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Franklin, I won’t play this game. I won’t
feel sorry for you.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I met a boy today, ten years old. He’s
paralyzed from the waist down. Why don’t you go regale him with vivid
tales about your trips to Europe and playing football at school. Tell
him how you courted your wife and fathered children. Tell him of a life
he can only dream of. I can’t help you out of a hole if I climb in with
you. Then we’re both stuck.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Here’s another one he’s refusin’.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Why don’t you read it?</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Don’t like telegrams. All them STOPS and
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Make you dizzy, Lionel.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: A little bit.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: “Would be honored if you place my name in
nomination for President. STOP. The party needs you. STOP. Yours
sincerely, Al Smith.”</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: The Governor of New York. Why don’t you
slide it under his door?</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: All right. Probably slide it right back.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: He won’t go. He doesn’t want to be seen
walking on crutches or being wheeled to the podium.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: The millions listening on radio won’t be
able to see that.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But all the people at the convention will.</p>

<p><strong>roy</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Howe.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hello, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can’t believe you’ve made me come all the
way back to this hell hole!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’ve done no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m here to take you to Houston. You started
your speech yet?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You know what this is, don’t you? It’s a
golden opportunity. A springboard for you to run for Governor.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ever hear of a Civil War General named
Francis Nicholls?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, I never heard of him either. But this
was one brave son-of-a- bitch. Fought for the Confederacy and lost his
left arm in one battle and his left foot in another. Then after the war
he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana – twice!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: He was a war hero.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Twice. Look, I’ve worked like a dog to keep
your name in play, grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: As much for you as for me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ll be damned if I’m going to let you pass
up a chance like this. It’s time – and you’re ready.</p>

<p><strong>roy</strong>: Very good to see you, Mrs. Roosevelt.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: You’re a mess.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: The report. I’ll never…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Oh my darling…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m useless, Eleanor. I feel so
useless.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: That’s not true. No one can make you feel
inferior without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: You have done a brilliant thing here – a
magnificent thing.</p>
<p><strong>leanor</strong>: Let’s get you in the water.</p>

<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Hi, Pop!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Elliot!</p>
<p><strong>lliot</strong>: Come on! You getting in?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I sense a conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. a clearing - day</strong>: 129 129</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Franklin, let go of your crutches. You’re
not going to need them.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: We’re going to make your arms function as
your legs.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Elliot, go to your father and stand on his
left side.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Think this may work, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Eleanor, take the crutch.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Now use your right shoulder and pull your
left leg forward.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Good! Now with the muscles in your left
shoulder, pull your right leg.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: One small bump and I’ll land right on my
keister!</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: That’s what Elliot is for. He’s going to
hold you up. Hitch your leg! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Elliot, don’t lean in – stand up straight.
Pull against him. He needs you!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’m strong, pop. You can’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You can do this, Franklin! Keep going!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Franklin, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m fine. I’m just…</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: This isn’t a replacement for the real work
we’re doing to get you on your feet again, understand? No one is
throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor’s report…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I know it’s not practical –</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No, it’s not. It’s political.</p>
<p><strong>ext. grounds - afternoon</strong>: 30 130</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Use Elliot, not the cane. Switch your weight
to Elliot… good! Keep your head up.</p>
<p><strong>eloise</strong>: Why is he working so hard to hide it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He doesn’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>eloise</strong>: Oh, I disagree.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How can you disagree? “There but for the grace
of God goes us,” that’s what they’re saying. As if our bodies is who we
are, but it’s not. It’s our souls is who we are, but they don’t know
that.</p>
<p><strong>eloise</strong>: I wish he could just wheel himself out there
in front of everybody.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: He can’t do that Eloise, it’s politics.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s not gonna matter if he hides his legs as
long as he don’t hide what he knows. And what he knows is what it’s like
to be one of us.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Good afternoon, everyone!</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Take a moment to catch your breath…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Damn. You okay son?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’m fine, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: You fell down.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Yes, I did, Daisy. Twelfth time today.
Must be a new record!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: And so America must find… No, America
needs a pathfinder…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: To emblaze the trail along a high road
that will avoid… avoid the bottomless morass…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What if I fall… trying to get to the
podium.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: If you fall, you show them how to get up.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No, if I fall in front of thousands of
people I lose everything but their pity. They’ll be writing my obituary
before I get up off the floor.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Elliot won’t let you fall, he’ll be there.
All the arrangements have been made, boss. It’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Who are we fooling? This will never work.
They’ll never let me back into politics. They’ll never see past my
legs.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: My darling, they’ll never see past your
legs unless you do.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Don’t worry, Doc – we’re not coming with
you.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Oh, you’ll be with me. No question of
that. I am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this
community. A community based not on birthright or privilege, but on
compassion and courage. The true power of these waters is that they
brought us all together. Our ability to help one another is what will
make our victory over polio endure. Our ability to survive… despite the
odds.</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: ranklin looks out at the sea of faces.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What we have done and will continue to do
until this disease is defeated is come together – like a family – and do
what we do best… Lift each other up.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Miss Mahoney I need to speak with you,
please.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Sure, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ranklin</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Don’t wear it in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’ll try not to. Good luck, Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’m throwing myself to the wolves.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You’ve faced worse. And if they bite, you
can come back here.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I’ll always come back here.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You’re being superstitious, Louis. There
aren’t any reporters here.</p>
