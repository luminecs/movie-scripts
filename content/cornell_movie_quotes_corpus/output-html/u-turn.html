<h1 id="u-turn">u-turn</h1>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Get off the goddamn road!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No!…Not now!…Shit!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You Harlin?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Nope. Darrell.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Harlin around?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: He’s up at the Look Out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Will he be back soon?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Doubt it. He’s dead. The Look Out’s a
cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You own this place?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Then why do you call it Harlin’s?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: ’Cause Harlin used to own it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: But he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You want to take a look at my car? I think
the radiator hose is–</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Damn. Gonna be another hot one today.
Sometimes I don’t even want to get out of bed. Course don’t want to get
out for the cold one’s neither. Then of course the clouds come in…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look, Harlin, I’ve got places to be.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Darrell–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: OK. Darrell… Could you just take a look at my
radiator hose. It’s busted.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: It’s your radiator hose. It’s busted.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know it’s busted. What did I just tell
you?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Well, you know so much why don’t you just
fix it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If I could do you think I’d be standing here
wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is
fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3
years ago when the mine got shut…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay, I’m stuck. You happy? Now can you fix
it, or not?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yeah, I can fix it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can
find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How much time?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Twenty-after-ten.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety
already.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Ninety-two. Course half hour from now might
be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Accident.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You got to be more careful. Hands is
important. Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don’t know
if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m very interested in this but is there
someplace…</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple
folk like it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll be back in a couple of hours. And be
careful with her, will you?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Just a car.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s not just a car. It’s a sixty-four and
half Mustang convertible. That’s the difference between you and me, and
why you live here and I’m just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out
of the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Hey! You there!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You want something, old man?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Don’t call me old man. Ain’t you got no
respect, boy?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You want something?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Yeah I want something. I want you to run
over to that machine and get me a pop.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You can’t do that yourself?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Hell no, I can’t do that myself. I’m
blind. Can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t–</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: What’d you think I was doing out here
with these glasses on? Sunnin’ myself?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know. I thought you were keeping the
sun out of your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I ain’t got no eyes. You want to see?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Christ no!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam. Lost them
fighting the commies. Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin’ the
commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I said I was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Don’t be sorry. Just run over there and
get me my pop before I die of thirst.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, sure. You got change?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Change? You want my change? I fought the
war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: All right, old man. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Get me a Dr. Peppa! I don’t want no
Colas. Colas ain’t nothing but flavored water.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Don’t forget to open it for me. I can’t
be opening my own bottle.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: A little for Mother Earth. I’m about
fifty percent Indian, you know. To all our relations.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Ah! Just what I needed! Want some?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I think you’d better give your pooch a sip.
He looks sick.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: That’s ’cause he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I hope you wasn’t pettin’ him none, was
you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell are you keeping a dead dog
around for?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: He’s only just dead. What was I supposed
to do with him? I can’t take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take
him for me. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hell no!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: See. Ain’t nothing I can do but keep him
here beside me. That’s where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that’s my
dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I
lost my eyes. He was just a pup then… a companion that’s loyal, that’ll
keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him…I miss him. I’ll
see ya later, unless I come across something worse.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Can I give you a hand, beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m just going to my car?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s right on my way.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: My mother told me never to accept offers from
strangers.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: My name is Bobby. Now I’m not a stranger
anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other,
beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do you have to call me that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know your real name.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Maybe I don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe, but if you didn’t I think you would
have kept on walking.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re pretty full of yourself, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I like that about me, beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s Grace.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: May I carry your package, Grace?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You sure you can manage?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do you want me to carry your pack for
you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Accident.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You should be more careful.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s very nice of you to help me. That
package is kind of heavy, and it’s so hot.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No trouble at all, really.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wasn’t nothing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, this isn’t my car. It’s down a ways. I
should have parked closer. I just didn’t think it would be so heavy. I
could drive up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s all right. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s just new drapes and curtain rods. If I
had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up
to the house.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I just got tired of looking at the old
drapes. My mother made them. Had them long as I can remember. You ever
seen something and just knew you had to have it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: ’Course they cost a little more than I should
really be spending. But, damn it, I don’t hardly ever do anything nice
for myself. I deserve nice things.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re welcome, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re not from around here, are you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why you say that? Just because I help a lady
with her package?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You don’t have that dead look in your eyes
like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I just drove in this morning.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Drove into Superior? What for?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Didn’t have a choice. My car overheated up
the road.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re lucky you didn’t break down in the
desert. Day like today, you’d be dead in no time. When you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Not until my car’s fixed. I don’t know how
long that’s going to take.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And here I’ve made you all hot and
sweaty.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Morning Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well it’s about time. Looks like you found
yourself a helper too.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well, he offered, and I just couldn’t refuse.
His car overheated.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Morning, officer.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Son. Little excitement out at the
reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all
night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his
shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Anybody hurt?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Hell, no. That Wayne can’t shoot when he’s
sober, much less drunk. He’s lucky he didn’t kill his own danged self.
Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Same here, officer.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well, I guess I could use some help getting
this box into the house. Not far. You could shower, get something cool
to drink.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, I could use something cool.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where you coming from?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just
lately Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’ve been around.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I guess I’ve got wander in my blood.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know. I have to make a stop in Vegas.
Business to finish. Then maybe I’ll head to Santa Barbara. I might be
able to pick up some action there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So, what is it you do, Mister…?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever
pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little
competition … .</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I never played tennis. You just travel around
Bobby– no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If you’re going to gamble, might as well play
for high stakes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What happens when you lose?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I pack up and go somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I couldn’t stay in this place. I wouldn’t.
I’d just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sometimes I feel the exact same way.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I want my money.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I want my money.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look, I’ll get the money! You don’t want to
do this!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Take two for now. One a week, punk…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Two weeks, asshole. Get the money or you
gonna lose your nose and ears.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thought you might like a refill on your
lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s good. Cools you right off. I saw you
watching me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I didn’t say it bothered me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Did you like it; me watching you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I guess. I’ve got an ego same as any man.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Good, ’cause I liked what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nice place.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who’s that, your father?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by
herself in a big house.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I guess it must.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you do anyway?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I
tell fortunes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where’d you learn to do that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: From my father. He was the tribe’s
shaman.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: A medicine man?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Those are white words, not ours.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nice house for a shaman’s daughter. You must
be good.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There’s something in your past; something you
want to keep hidden. There’s a pain. Something … someone you can’t
forget. And there is something you want very badly. It seems very far
away to you, but you are determined, and you will do what you must to
get it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: My face tell you all that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It tells me what every face tells me.
Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they
want. What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The same thing you do.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Really? I want to hang drapes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hold me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Tighter. I won’t break. You know girls are a
lot tougher than men think.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There. All done. Lift me down.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Lift me down.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You can let go of me now. I’m safe. How do
they look?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Like you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I like them. I was sick of looking at this
room. I think they add a little life.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nothing like a little liveliness.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No more drapes to hang. Now what should we
do?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And what would that be?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: All right, Grace. No more games.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You flirt with me, then you run cold. You
lead me on, then slap me down. I don’t go for being jerked around.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Really? And what game did you want to play?
You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I think I can find my own way back to into
town.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Maybe I like to find out about a man first.
Maybe I like to know what he’s made of.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m just flesh and blood, baby. That and a
few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know
that. You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You never did answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Still playing?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s not an answer. What is it you
want?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You know what I want.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Maybe I just want to hear you say it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grace!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who the hell is this!?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m her husband.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now who the hell are you, and it better be
good, or God help me I’ll break you in half.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Easy, chief. I… I was helping your wife. I
met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Didn’t much look like you were hanging
drapes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I swear to you that’s all that happened. I
haven’t so much as set foot in your bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A lot that means.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace, tell him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Damn it, Grace! Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh yeah, and I suppose you didn’t have
anything to do with it Grace, he just wandered up here by hisself. I got
a mind to put you over my knee and paddle your ass raw!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where you going!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You can’t just walk in here and walk out, you
sonufabitch! I’m gonna tear you a new asshole!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You broke my nose!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It ain’t broke.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Goddamn it! I’m… you’re lucky I don’t sue
you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You people are crazy!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuckin’ shithole!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the fuck do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be
walking… People die out here, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aw, you’re not still upset about that love
tap, are you? If I meant you real trouble, I’d have given it to you by
now. Get in, lad. Come on. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got
so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and
finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It’s a funny
thing, women.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Say, what happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Accident.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ve got to be–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, I know. More careful.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I guess we’ve never been introduced proper.
Jake McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s a solid name.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m a solid man.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bobby Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: “Bobby Cooper.” What brings you to Superior,
Coop?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: An overheated car.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Darrell’s a moron.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: California…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Live there?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Got work. I know a man who’s got a boat.
Wants me to sail it for him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You a sailor man? That’d be the life. Drive
across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could
pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a
memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to
you after awhile.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I hope so. Listen, McKenna about your wife:
If I had known she was married–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It wouldn’t have made a difference to you, now
would it? Not a wit. Do you know why? Because you’re a man without
scruples.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wait a second–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ah, I can smell it on you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s the sweat of a man who hasn’t an honest
bone in his body. Don’t be offended, lad. A man who’s got no ethics is a
free man. I envy that. Beside, how can I blame you? That Grace sure has
a mind of her own, and a body to match, don’t she? Eh?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She does at that. I knew when I married her
she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was
I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you
don’t think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh?
Women.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Can’t live with them, and you can’t shoot
’em.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: “You can’t shoot ’em!” I like that. I bet she
led you on good, didn’t she? Taking you up to the house to hang drapes.
Oh that’s a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in
your face. I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out.
Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going
under you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Like you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can
tell you got a temper on you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right
then, didn’t you? Bet you just wanted to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Would you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Would I what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Would you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Because I’m sick and tired of her little
games. Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one
would ever see you again. Because I’ve got a fifty-thousand dollar life
insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man
who does her in a good chunk of it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ve done a few things but I’m not a
murderer, Mr. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How do you know if you’ve never tried?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: This is a joke, right? You just want to
rattle me. Right?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right. Nothing but a joke. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Enjoy your stay, lad.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who are these people?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Got any cold soda?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Soda. You got any soda?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es
bien.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Soda. You know.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh. Something to eat. Si.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Not eat. Drink. What the fuck is drink in
Spanish … uh, agua?</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: That’s right, lady. Keep it in you and nobody
gets hurt. That goes for you too, stud. Gimmie the money. Now!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: The dinero, Senora. Hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: That’s it? Lady, I got kids to put through
school.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Es all I have.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Okay, pal. Whatcha got? Give it, now.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Better…you’re getting tasty. Now toss the
bag, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s just books.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: I’m a reader. Toss it.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: How touching…I like family values. Give it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: Hey man, forget it. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Senor, give him the bag.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: That’s all right. He doesn’t want to give me
the bag…</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: He’s fucking with you man. Shoot
him.</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: Let’s go, man.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you
just relax.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No! No! My wedding ring.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Now we go.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You go to El Diablo!</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: Bugger! You bitch!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I call the sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No! No police.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: A hundred dollars? No police?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No police until I leave.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hey, your … what the hell happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Don’t look like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Just banged my head. It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Another accident? You got to be more
careful.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell happened to my car?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Bottom hose was shot too. Rotted clear
through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Well … you got your parts, you got your
labour … let’s call it a hundred-fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How much!?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hundred-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: A goddamn radiator hose in a
sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that
hose?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: About an hour and a half, because that’s all
the longer I’ve been gone.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Actually, it’s been about three hours.
You’re the one thinks that car’s so damn fancy. What you expect but
fancy damn prices?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to
tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: “That’s not just a Ford, that’s a
sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.”</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s that got to do with the radiator
hose?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: I don’t know, but “it’s the reason I’m
living here and you’re just passing through.” Now you owe me a
hundred-fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars,
because I don’t have the money.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Then you ain’t gonna have the car.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Listen, man. I got rolled half an hour ago
for everything I had.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ve got five…six dollars.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Then you’re only a hundred-forty-five in
the hole. You can keep that dollar. Now why don’t you just take your
American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV
and have him send you the money lickity split.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t have a goddamn credit card.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Now that’s too bad. I sure hope you know
how to wash dishes or shovel shit ’cause you’re gonna have to work this
one off.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look, I got a Movado. It’s worth at least
seven, eight hundred. You could sell it for that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You don’t need numbers. That’s why it’s
expensive. Look at the gold.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: …got no day, got no date. Probably ain’t
worth a duck’s fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it’s got every
doodad you can imagine. No sir I’ll stick with this .</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You son of a bitch! I’ll have my lawyers shut
you down.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You ain’t got no credit card but you got a
lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want. Didn’t you read the sign? It
says…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: I want my hundred and forty-five
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: One-hundred-thirteen degrees. That was back in
July of forty-seven. That afternoon it dropped down to forty three! True
story.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: One time last year I remember it went from 98
to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come out like…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You got a beer?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Beck’s.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: No Beck’s. A-1, Coors…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Heineken?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: No, we ain’t got no Heineken. We got
Miller.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Genuine Draft?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: No. Just plain ol’ Miller. Now you can fuckin’
take it or you can fuckin’ leave it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll fuckin’ take it. To go.</p>
<p><strong>short order cook</strong>: Flo, cheeseburger bleedin’.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: I’ll be right back with that beer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: …and a waitress named Flo. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fucking cat.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter for the
juke?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a
quarter?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more
careful.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Got any requests?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That country shit all sounds the same to
me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How about I pick one out for you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How
come, I wonder, she don’t put out no more new records.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cause she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Gee, that’s sad. Don’t that make you sad?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ve had time to get over it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re not from around here, are you? Where
you from?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oz.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You ain’t from Oz. Oz is in that movie.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re too quick for me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No….No….No I’m seeing but I’m not
believin’…Stop the wedding. This can’t be. Hey! What are you doing with
my girl?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I axed you a question.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Aw, Toby, we weren’t doing nothing. We was
just talking.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over
to our table. Now, I’m not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you
doing with my girl?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I wasn’t doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s not the way it looked to me. Looked to
me like you was trying to make time with her.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Make time? Is everybody in this town on
drugs?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter
for the jukebox.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man’s business
to take care of. I ain’t never taken no drugs, mister, and …</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Then maybe you should’ve. Look, pal, I wasn’t
making a play for your girl.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You expect me to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t care what you believe as long as you
leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mister, I’m calling you out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What? You want to fight? Over her?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the man
alone.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let’s see…they’re not very imaginative?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: ’Cause I’m just like dynamite. And when I go
off, somebody gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now
I’m scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Christ, I don’t believe this!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Stand up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I wasn’t hitting on your girl!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Stand up, Mister, or I’ll beat you where you
sit.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Toby, you stop it now! Can’t you see he’s got a
hurt hand?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Don’t you never mind, Flo. This is gonna be
over real quick.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re lucky, Mister. Don’t think it’s over. I
called you out and I’m gonna see this through. You hear me? Come on,
girl. I got half a mind to make you walk home.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has
gotten cuter’n a bunny’s nose.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he
sees is after his Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: More like Jenny is after every man she
sees.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How’s it with you, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Already started out bad. Couple of bikers
from out of town tried to knock over Jamilla’s grocery store this
morning. It was a real shootout.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: The old witch killed ’em both.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Poor thing. Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Sure, when the sons of bitches tried to
steal her wedding ring. That’s when she started shooting. Can’t blame
her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died. Store’s a mess.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: It’s the desert. That’s what it is. The desert
makes everybody crazy. Ain’t that right, Sheriff? People go crazy out
here.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Come on, Boyd. I’ve got to make tracks. That
yogurt’s got to make Santa Fe before it spoils.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Dr. Pepper don’t have that problem.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: I can’t open off-sale for you, sugar.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Let me get your change.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Flo, I’m just gonna help myself to a refill
on the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: You be careful now, Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I think I burned my gun hand!</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: I could put some butter on it, hon’. It’d serve
you right, you asshole. Put it under some cold water. Joe, run get a mop
and clean this fuckin’ mess up.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Shasta! Now why’d you go and scare the nice man
like that? Sorry about that, mister. Let’s see, you want $3.25. You try
to have a nice day now, would you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sure, I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cici? Cici, it’s Bobby…Bobby Cooper…Yeah,
look, I know it’s been a while, but I’m kind of in a
jam…yeah…One-hundred-fifty dollars…That’s a lie. I called you on your
birthday..Two years ago…I can’t help it if you didn’t get the message.
Cici, honey, I don’t want to argue. I need you to wire me the
money…Because they’re fucking going to KILL ME! I didn’t steal your
CD’s…Yeah, well where’s my Mr. Coffee. Cici…Cici…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bitch. Cunt.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: 73-11, this is Pluto. What’s the line on
Dallas?</p>
<p><strong>gambler’s voice</strong>: Pluto. Fucking deadbeat. We head
about you. You owe “the commie” 13 dimes, why you tryin’ to get in my
office? Lose this fuckin’ number.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mike…Mike…you asshole.</p>
<p><strong>gambler’s voice</strong>: Mike who?</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: Da?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: Sergei, what are you, a Neanderthal? How
many times do I have to tell you? You answer a phone “hello,” not
“da.”</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I have a collect call from Bobby Cooper.
Will you accept the charges?</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: Mr. Arkady, deadbeat Cooper’s calling.</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: He’s calling collect.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know, Mr. Arkadin. I know. I was on my way
to you, it’s just … what a day I’ve had. I know I’m coming up with a
highly improbable story, and I know you’re not going to believe this,
but this …is… what happened. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on
my way to Vegas when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: That’s a shame, Bobby. A real shame.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And that’s not the half of it,
Mr. Arkadin…</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: “Arkady”</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Right, Mr. Arkady. And that’s not the half of
it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this
hicktown to get something to eat and then… well, it gets robbed!</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: …And let me guess. This robber – he gets
your money.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they both
get nailed… get shot by the old lady.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: The old lady?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: With a shotgun! She kills both of ’em, and…
and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill
is left alive. I mean, what are the odds?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta
there before the cops showed. So now I don’t have a cent to my name. I
can’t even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mister… if it
weren’t for bad luck I wouldn’t have nay fuckin’ luck at all, you know?
So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I
could get my car out of this garage, see? The bus depot here has a
Western Union thing. And of course I’ll pay it back with the rest of the
money.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: Which you don’t have.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can
sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it’s worth 16 at least. I just need the
150, uh…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, if you could send it care of…</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: …Now, let me get this straight. Two
years you give me problems with your fuckin’ payoffs. Now you owe me
thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire
you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: A hundred-forty-five would probably cover
it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: A hundred and … Now you listen to me you
deadbeat little punk: I don’t care if you got hit by a truck and run
over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want
it. I don’t care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk
tomorrow, or I’ll show you what real bad luck is.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: Do you understand me you little
fuck?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: What’d you say to me!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shit I’m sorry!…you can’t believe the strain
I’m under. I’m just under a lot of strain here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: Bobby, you owed me that ‘bread’ 4 weeks
ago. Now you tell me you want another week. That’s 5 weeks, Bobby.
That’s also 5 fingers, cause you and I know it’s a finger a week Bobby.
So you got balls. Good–now you come here tomorrow and you talk to me
real nice and maybe I don’t take the other 3 fingers you owe me, you
see? Tomorrow – and Bobby, don’t make me come look for you, okay…have
nice day.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: The nerva that piece of shit! And look
at you, you Neanderthal – don’t you fuckin’ break pencils, you
goombah!</p>
<p><strong>sofia</strong>: Finger? What are you, a faggot? In my country
a man don’t pay we cut off his head.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arkady</strong>: Get your ass down to this Superior,
Arizona. Bring me this Bobby Cooper. I don’t think he got the lesson.
This is your last chance, Sergei.</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: Da.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Are you finished with your call?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Please deposit an additional seventy-five
cents.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Goddamn rat’s ass fuck! Shit! Damn! Damn!
Damn!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Thank you for using AT&amp;T.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I hate this fuckin’ town! I
hate it! Do you hear me? Get me outta here, please. I gotta get out of
this place.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What can I do for you, lad?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I was hoping we could talk.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Talk? About what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: About things. About your wife.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sweet Grace? What about her?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: About what you said this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You said you had an insurance policy out on
your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You said you’d cut that up with the man who
did her in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t play simple with me, Jake. You’re a
betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I’ll kill Grace if you
cut me in on the money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Boy I think this heat’s getting to you the way
you’re rambling on.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not rambling.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re talking like a madman.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well then, I guess that qualifies me for
citizenship in this town. You’re the one brought it up. This morning. In
your car.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin’
pissed off. I don’t want anybody dead.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A man doesn’t always mean the things he
says.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You meant it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Because you’re a slimy bastard who would have
his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And what does that make you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The slimy bastard who’s going to do it for
you… You’re a jealous man Jake. If you can’t have Grace to
yourself…well, you’re not the sharing kind.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate
relationship with Grace.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You love her, but you hate her?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of
person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little “games” she plays.
Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The
bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she
likes it. She tortures me. But she’s family. She’s my little girl. My
baby. I couldn’t stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she
sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her
skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy…How much you
want?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Make it twenty.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How much could you get?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe … ten-thousand. And that’s a maybe.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I need thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s a bit much.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re not talking about buying a car Jake.
We’re talking about killing your wife. It’s thirteen, or it’s
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling
you were my boy when I met you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not your boy. I don’t like you. I got no
choice but to do business with you. Let’s just call this a nasty little
marriage of convenience.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t say that. I had a marriage of
convenience with Grace, and look where that’s lead… Well, looks like we
got ourselves a contract.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If you can’t trust the man you’ve hired to
kill your wife …? The thing is it’s got to look like an accident; that’s
the thing. If it doesn’t, then it’s no good. I won’t get a dime, and
it’s my neck that’ll be on the chopping block while you’re living it up
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How do you want it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How the hell should I know? I’ve never had a
wife killed before. Jesus Christ! You want this job, you don’t know how
to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You want to do this yourself? I don’t have to
do this, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Be quiet, boy. I got to figure this thing. I’m
thinking. It can’t be done at the house. It should be…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come to think of it, how ’bout some money
upfront?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh yeah sure. Why don’t I buy you a plane
ticket right out of here while I’m at it. I know you… This is what you
do: Go to the house to see her.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And tell her what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …I don’t know. Tell her you had to see her.
Tell her you don’t care if she’s married or not, you had to be with her.
Sweet talk the woman. A young buck like you must be good at that. Then …
maybe shift the conversation. Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.
She loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does love. She’ll want to
take you for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know you’re not surprised I’m back here,
cause you can read my mind and all.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you
say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How do you know he’s still not here?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Guys like me take those chances. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She’ll take you out somewhere in the desert.
She loves it out there; ridin’ through the red rock and the mesas. So do
I. I guess we got that in common. She’ll ride you out someplace quiet.
Someplace deserted.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There won’t be anyone for miles around. Just
the two of you and some prairie dogs. That’s all. You can sweet talk her
a little if you like. Makes no difference to me. Just put her at ease,
make her feel relaxed – then do it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Are there snakes out here?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They hear you comin’. They won’t bother you.
Just don’t sneak up on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Doesn’t the isolation bother you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a
reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake’s the
same way. He loves the desert. I guess we’re alike that way. That’s
about the only way.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You love him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Did you ever?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a
reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That’s where
they stick Indians, Bobby. That’s where they leave us to die. My brother
killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn’t take it anymore. There’s
no hope there… Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Is that why you’re with him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I let him think he was courtin’ me, but I
reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he
could give me, and I would’ve done anything to get him. Is that
love?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m guessing no.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, I guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I take it things didn’t much work out the way
you planned.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m still here, aren’t I? See this?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: All this nothing? It doesn’t get to Jake like
it gets to me. He says he don’t mind being nothing but a big fish in a
small pond. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You could leave him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Walk away.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not that easy. Maybe you can take
chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you
please. I can’t. I don’t want to be alone. I need to know I’m going to
be taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some
guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that so bad? It’s not like I wouldn’t try
to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would … do things for
him. I guess I’m no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along
like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn’t blame you if you did. But
maybe it’s like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get
out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I wish I was a bird. I know it’s stupid.
Every child says that. When I was growing up some of the old ones on the
reservation believed people could actually change into animals. I wish I
could.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to
Disney World. I always wanted to go there. I’d fly to New York. Maybe. I
guess New York isn’t the best place to be a bird. I’d fly to St. Louis,
then New Orleans, all over Texas. Then I’d fly to California. I guess by
then I’d have seen it all and I could die.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They say you don’t feel anything. The shock
kills you before you hit the ground. I don’t know how they would know
that. But I heard it’s just like flying; straight down into the ground.
I guess if it doesn’t hurt it’s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hate’s a funny thing. Right now I bet you
don’t know if you want to kill me, or fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No…Stop! I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s the matter?…Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t feel like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you
can.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace, I’ve been fucked over too many times,
by too many women. You’re becoming the queen of hot and cold.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’d never understand.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s just such a mess. With Jake I mean…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nothing I understand better than a mess.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You mean the Shaman?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He was a Shaman…in the mine. We had nothin’
after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call
me his “little halfbreed”… He kept Mom on the side y’know, cause he was
married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him
around here…but the thing was…you see… …he was raping me the whole
time…for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used
to say he was in love with my ass. Y’ever been in love with a woman’s
ass?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re sick too…he loved to do things to me.
Control me. My Mom…it tore her up cause she couldn’t do nothing about
it. She become alcoholic…and the funny thing is– I liked it. I liked
being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got,
I wanted more. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don’t want to
be taken like, really taken – that’s bullshit – they do. The first time
he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he
started crying like a baby…wanted me to hold him. It’s a strange feeling
to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him,
comfort him… They found my Mom right down there at the bottom of Apache
Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil…Sheriff
Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I’ll never believe she
ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved
it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: After he got his divorce, he forced me to
marry him…but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some
day I’d get Jake for what he did to her…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you
ever been to California?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh yeah. It’s far, it’s another world.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is it pretty?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh yeah. It’s beautiful, beautiful beaches.
Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Please. I won’t hang on you. As soon as we
get there you can dump me. I don’t care. I just want to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Honey, baby, I can’t. I can’t even get out of
here myself. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks
to get my car back from that crazy mechanic…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Darrell? You know he and Jake are…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You don’t have any money put away, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake never gives me more’n twenty bucks at a
time, like a bird in a cage, he don’t want me goin’ anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: …you could get me money. I’ll get you out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There’s money. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In
the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: At night. He just sits there and laughs and
talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a
hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: In cash?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh yeah. There’s nothing else with Jake. He
don’t trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed.
He loves it so much, he wouldn’t think of spending any of it on me. I
never seen it but I know he’s got more than a hunnert thousand at
least…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: One-hundred-thousand!? That
son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It takes a key. He keeps it on himself all
the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up against me when we do
it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If the key’s on him, how do we get the
key?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t kill, Grace. I can’t kill
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not like he’s a young man, Bobby. He’s
had time to live. It’d be quick. I mean, he wouldn’t even have to feel
it… I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it’s quiet…when
he’s asleep, you could just come up behind him when he’s pounding on me
and…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shit! Listen to you… Are you crazy,
Grace?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jesus Christ! I think this place is making me
crazy. I was crazy to come back here and see you. I’m crazy for
listening to anyone in this town, and I’d sure as hell be crazy if I
spent another minute with you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: But it’s in you, Bobby. I see it. I see
Death. It’s in your heart. Let it out for me. Let it out…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do it for me, Bobby, you’ll never regret it.
I promise you. I’ll do anything for you. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I…take me back to town…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You need the money, Bobby. It’s a lot more
than $100,000. A lot more. How are you going to get out of here? You
need the money. Whatever it takes, Bobby, remember?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where you going? I’ll give you the ride…Come
back! Bobby? It’s three miles.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ve got the killing in you, boy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Next time you’ll do just fine.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: It’s the desert that makes you crazy. The
loneliness out here. Nobody to talk to. People on the run. Trailer
parks. White trash. I seen some peculiar things on a hot day. I seen a
scorpion sting itself to death. It just keeps driving its tail into its
body again and again. A little killer killing itself. Seen a coyote kill
itself too. Just kept on biting and tearing at its own legs. Near tore
one clean off before it bled to death. And what a white man’ll do when
it’s freezing one moment, hot as hell the next. A man could get hisself
killed just for rubbing shoulders with another kiss kissy kiss. Nice
pussy y’see, see it coming. I don’t know what it is about the desert. I
figger it’s sort of like putting a kettle of water over a fire. People
is mostly water. We boil when it’s hot. ’Cept when we boil the water’s
got no place to go. It just churns inside of us until we can cool off.
If it’s not too late.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You sure seen a lot for a blind man.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Just ’cause I ain’t got eyes doesn’t mean
I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That a fact?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I can see just fine. For example: You’re
a young man who thinks he’s got someplace to be.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe I do.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Or maybe you just think you do. Just
another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna
have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one
thing – are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out
there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run
just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that’s where you gonna
be.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I think I’ve heard that before.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: What do you want for free?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You sure got a lot of philosophy, old
man.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Seems like I do but only cause end of the
day we’re all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: …And everything is nothing too.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Think you’ll live that long?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear
you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can’t see him. Well he’s right.
Motherfucker. But that ain’t mean I don’t know what’s going on around
here. They’re all cursed. Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who’s cursed?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: All them miners last century. Hungry
ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with
blood, think I’m fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men
cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They
put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can’t
seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your
fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I thought you said you lost your eyes in the
war?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: So now you’re going to tell me where I
lost my eyes. You don’t think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there
when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There’s
always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in
the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in
the 50’s. This town’s all inbreeding.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Well, people gotta get by somehow. That’s
the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium,
fuckononium, assononium, all that “om”! Everybody’s got a mother. You
don’t rip up your mother. You don’t rip up the Earth and take everything
out. It’s like the Cracker Jack box says, “the more you eat, the more
you want….”…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I got things to do.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: …But ain’t you got a little something for
the infirm?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m a little short Pops. I’ll catch you next
time.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Your lies are old, but you tell ’em
well.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey mister. Mister, I just… I just wanted to
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: For defending my honor this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I
wasn’t defending you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: But you was going to fight for me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I wasn’t going to fight for you. I was just
going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He’s not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take
me out and stuff, but I ain’t spoken for. Not yet that is.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Get it through your head, little girl; I’m
not going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I’d marry
him. You’re not going to get much better in this town.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s what I thought until you came riding
in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It’s a cool car. Want to
take me for a ride? Desert’s kind of lonely this time of day.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Eighteen… Well, I’m gonna be eighteen in two
years, but that don’t mean you can’t take me for a ride if you want.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I don’t want to take you for a ride. What
I want is for … Hey, you don’t think you can get $150 from your parents,
could you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mister!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s right, Mister. You better be afraid. I
told you it wasn’t over, but you didn’t listen. Now I find you sneakin’
around with my girl behind my back.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I wasn’t sneaking around with your girl.
Would you please tell him?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re too late, Toby. We’re going to get in
his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s your name anyway?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, that tears it, Mister. I’m gonna bust you
up but good. I’m gonna bust you into a million pieces and then … and
then bust those pieces up, and then … and then spread them all around.
That’s what I’m gonna do. You don’t know what you’re dealing with,
Mister. I’m crazy. I’m psycho crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, I know. You’re TNT. Just like dynamite.
When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let’s do this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Toby Tucker, it don’t matter to me if you
beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he’s just drooling and
bleeding all over hisself, ’cause we love each other and we gonna run
off, and I’m gonna have his love child.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Will you shut up!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You gonna pay for that, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Toby!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey, Sheriff Potter.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That ain’t true, Sheriff. I was home for
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Boy, I’m not trying to hear nothing from
you except that you’re heading home. Now run along.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, sir. Come on, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I want to stay.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I said come on!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Bye, Mister. Don’t go nowhere without me. I
wanna have your love child.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Next time, Mister. Next time.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Where ya goin’?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Harlin’s.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Seen you popping up a little bit of
everywhere today. You’re not planning on staying are you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, sir. I’m not going to be around long if
that’s what you’re worried about.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That’s a nasty cut you got there.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as
it looks.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: There was a young fellow over at Jamilla’s
today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around good by
one of the robbers.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff,
but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Everything all right, Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was just up at Darrell’s. How’s the wife?
That little eskimo baby walkin’ yet?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Oh just fine.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You haven’t seen Grace around, have you? I’m
looking for her.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: No. But if I do, I’ll tell her you’re
looking for her, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Peculiar, how things happen. A man’s car
breaks down. There’s a hold up. People die and all that money – and now
old Jake out looking for his young wife. And then you show up…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Time’s running out, son. I’ll be seeing you
in the morning…</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hey there. I was beginnin’ to think you
wasn’t comin’ back… You don’t look so good.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, well, I’ve been around the bend a
bit.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: One of those days you feel like you been
runnin’ in circles and you ain’t no closer to where you tryin’ to get
than when you started?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’ve been there?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hell, I’ve had days I would gladly trade
with a whippin’ dog. Ain’t much you can do when you feel like that ’cept
tough it out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You think bad, and bad is what you get.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s a good piece of advice, Darrell.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: No charge.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty
bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I’m going I swear I’ll–</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Two-hundred.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: It’s going to cost you two-hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You said this morning the hose was going to
run me one-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone I
replaced a gasket. That’s going to run you another fifty.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I didn’t tell you to replace any gasket.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yeah, but it was shot.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t give a fuck! I didn’t tell you to do
it! You can’t just do unauthorized work.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Well, now, you just know all there is about
bein’ a mechanic, don’t you? Didn’t you read the sign.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What sign?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: The goddamn sign on the wall. I can’t do
unauthorized work? What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of
here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an accident and get killed. Or
worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna blame me, and there goes my
reputation.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What reputation? You’re nothing but an
ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Is that an insult? Are you insulting
me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe
me money, and this car ain’t going nowheres until I get it. And if you
take another five hours I’ll find another fifty dollars worth of work to
do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here ’fore I call the Sheriff,
who knows me.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You want to play, Mister? I’ll play with
you. You want to smash something? So do</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No! Okay! Okay!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What’s the matter? The fight gone out of
you? I’m just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Mister, you already pissed me off but
good.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: There you go, sweet talking me again.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look, Harlin.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Darrell.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Darrell. I’ll get you your money. I just have
to get something out of the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the fuck did you do to my trunk?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Well, that key’s not gonna work. I had to
pop the lock. You didn’t leave me the trunk key.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And you had to go into the trunk, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: When I work on a car, I work on a car.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You can’t help yourself, can you mister?
You’re out of control.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I need a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Out of here.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: But, in particular?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I … Mexico. You got a bus that goes to
Mexico? That’s where I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico
would you like–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t care, just get me there.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a
local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It’ll get you
across the border.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: One way, or round trip?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: One way.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: 30.55. Twenty more will get you back.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Twenty-seven, fifty. That’s all I got.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The ticket is 30.55.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. It’s $30.55 for the
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Please, ma’am, you don’t understand! I have
to get out of here. They’re going to come looking for me. They’re going
to kill me. If I can’t get this ticket then I’m going to have to do
things to get out of here. You know what I mean! I don’t want to hurt
anybody, I just want to leave. Please. I can’t…I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Okay, I’ll give you the ticket, sir,
but…just…just, please calm down, please!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Keep your change. Bus three-twenty-three.
Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just … you know …</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: Got you, shitface! Bobby Cooper. Bobby
Cooper…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Where’s the fire sweetheart? Don’t know how
they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am
looking town. I not even moving.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Whoa, what kind of accent you got there?
You one of them Russians?</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: I am Russian, da! I am also rich Russian,
da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just
cause you Russians ain’t commies anymore, don’t think money can buy
everything…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What’s that? …“concealed” is a definite no
no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla’s grocery
store?</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: What fuckin grocery store, you fucking
shithead idiot! You call yourself a police…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Get out of the car, spread them. You can
jawbone all you want or you have the right to shut the fuck up! You
commie motherfucker. Either way you’re goin’ to the can.</p>
<p><strong>sergei</strong>: I want my lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Get up, Mister! Don’t ever let it be said Toby
Tucker beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair
chance.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m doing what any man would do if he’d been
offended. I’m stompin’ your ass.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You idiot! You don’t even know what you’re
fighting over!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: My honor, that’s what I’m fighting over. Now
get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Toby! Toby Tucker, leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up,
and that ain’t a thing for a woman to see.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t be afraid of him none. I don’t care
what he does to you, we can still be together.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Now, what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mexico? You going to Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m leaving. You never have to see me again.
Just please, give me the ticket!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: This means something to you? Jenny means
something to me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stop it! You’re killing him!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re killing him! Toby!? Toby!?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You killed him! You killed him!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hello, Grace? It’s Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I wanted to talk.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t think we have anything to talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What about us?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There is no us, remember?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Except I can’t get you out of my head,
Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth
scare you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Because I know you’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I mean it, Grace. I’m getting out of here,
and I want to take you with me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I thought you couldn’t get your car.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I could if I had Jake’s money.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that what changed your mind? The
money?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t give a damn about the money. I want
you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There’s only one way to
do that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Are you sure?… About me, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I came back for you; this morning I came
back. Before I even knew about the money. You’re what I want. The only
reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake. But
I’ve had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you
and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we’ve got to get the
money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell
out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You said you couldn’t kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We don’t have to kill him. Just knock him out
and tie him up ’till we get away. It was your idea, remember? I’m doing
this for you. I’m doing this so you can fly…fly like a bird.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace … Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: After dark. I’ll leave the back door
unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who was that on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You spent a long time talking for a wrong
number. But then you make friends so easily. Don’t you, Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I put up new drapes, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know. I was here when your apprentice was
helping you. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You never said anything. About the
drapes.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They look nice.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You haven’t even looked at them once.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They look nice.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought
you would like the colors.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What the hell you looking at, girl?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Well, that’s it. Sun’s going down. People
go home, trade stories over dinner. They’ll talk about the day, about
the heat, laugh about something crazy it made them do. They’ll kiss,
sleep a few hours, then do it all over again.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The day wasn’t so bad. We all got through it
all right.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Ain’t over yet. Night is part of day;
separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see
things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Difference between you and me, old man, is I
see the glass half full, you see it half empty.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Night is when you want to sleep, but the
dry heat keeps you tossin’ and turnin’. It’s when you wish the sun was
bakin’ high in the sky so you could see what it is you’re afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You afraid of the dark?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark.
All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what
they can’t see. I can’t see nuthin’, so it’s all the same to me. Kiss
from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp,
slurp, the kiss of death . It’s all the same to me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So, we’re all just floating along like twigs
in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: More or less.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Not this twig, friend. I got plans.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh
harder than a man’s plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my
life. I know you didn’t plan on straying into town.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No and I don’t plan on sticking around
either.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Well, don’t say I didn’t warn you when
things go your way.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer
but you don’t fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One
minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it’s the joint. Now it’s a
woman? I’m hep to you.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Used to be a young smartass like you.
Then I got smart with the wrong man’s daughter. Got some acid poured on
my peepers for my trouble. You know human beings ain’t always just human
– they got animals living inside ’em too…People give spare change to war
heroes not fools. All fools get is pity. May not have eyes, but I see.
And you, boy?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: You got my pity.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Oh, she was worth it. She was worth every
black minute since.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Time’s up. Any last words of wisdom?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Things ain’t always the way they seem.
You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going
to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you’re
doing. Are you a human being – or just one of them hungry ghosts out
there floatin’ around?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old
man.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: You know I won’t be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Cheap bastard. Gives me back my own
money… Well, Jesse, time’s up, let’s go for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What the hell you doin’, Grace? Are you coming
to bed, or aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ya little bitch, you like it don’t you! You
like it this way – rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your
Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don’t you, cause you know
Daddy’s the best.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes, yes, hit me…beat me, please.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart
from your Mama, didn’t ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There
ain’t no forgivin’ ya, girl!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You broke her heart! You broke your Mama’s
heart. You stole me! That’s right. Fuck it away. But it ain’t ever goin’
away, cause your Mama – she’s like a hungry ghost baby, she won’t go
away, she won’t leave ya alone.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No! No! Please!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh baby, I’m so sorry… I’m so sorry… I didn’t
mean to hurt you so bad. It just…got away…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Forgive me, baby, forgive me!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You didn’t hear something?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my
ass.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s someone in the house.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Relax baby. Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake, don’t go out there. Call the
sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of
things…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, well. As I live and breathe. I didn’t
expect to be seeing the like of you again. Thought you’d be long on your
way by now.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s my gun… That fucking Darrell!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I like Darrell. He may be an idiot, but he’s
my half brother. We own Harlin’s together, yeah, that little redneck
manages to get paid no matter how things work out.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I guess this is what they call “ironee”?
Hunh?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s not what you think, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, but it don’t matter anyway when you’re
lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I’m telling Sheriff
Potter about this drifter, didn’t have enough money to fix his car. And
Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard
old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break
in and steal it!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wait a minute. Just listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …And he thought he’d clock old Jake McKenna
and turn his brains into wall paper…and then maybe borrow $200 or
$20,000, or $200,000…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s another reason? It better be good.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I came for Grace.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You came to take my wife from me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Shhh! Liar.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s the truth, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s a thick change of heart from this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe I don’t like being played, like she
played us today. Maybe I don’t like that at all, Jake. I’m just pissed
enough, maybe I’ll rip the neck off my own grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of
talk.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill
me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were
going to give me thirteen-thousand. Give me two-hundred. I’ll kill her
and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the
perfect place. There won’t be enough left for an autopsy. But I need the
the money. I’ve got to have the money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She’s in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wanna give me my gun?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A strangling’ll do just fine. Go to work.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How ’bout the pipe?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hold on a second! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How the hell did you know where the bedroom’s
at?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What are you talking about!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on, Jake –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t Jake me boy! It’s a big house. You
probably didn’t even make it out to the desert this afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …Or did you just ply the afternoon away
between my sheets putting your lips all over her, you little
horndog…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re right! I don’t give a damn about her.
But killing her’s one thing. Fucking her behind my back, that’s
another!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now you’ve tasted both of us!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: O.K.! I admit it! I fucked her! But it’s her
you have to worry about, not me! She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you
dead and she wants your money.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How did the evening end? After you went to
bed did she linger a bit? Maybe just long enough to leave the door
unlocked? Is that what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’d tell me anything to save your pathetic
life.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake.
You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior. What’s she
to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is
two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Two-hundred dollars?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Two-hundred dollars…I’ll do it! I’ll kill
her!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sweet Christ, I’d be doing the world a favor,
ridding it of the likes of you. Get your miserable ass off the floor.
You’re positively pathetic… Go on, go kill Grace.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m not letting you walk for nothing. Two
hundred dollars. Do it, boy. Kill her.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grace!!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well…looks like you got him, Grace. That’s
good…that’s real good. He must of slipped past me, but you got him.
Looks like that drifter from this morning. Got to be careful who you
make friends with, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why don’t you put that down? It’s all over
now. Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go on, girl. Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aww, that’s my Grace: Not about to let someone
get the best of her. That’s what I love about you. As dangerous as you
are unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace, goddamit, do something!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grace…?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Help me, Grace, help…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Like you helped her, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell’d you wait for?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The money’s right here! Get the key!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No! You get it!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Didn’t I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Fuck me baby!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let him watch. I want him to know what he’s
missing.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What you want?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: We’re closed. Come back when the sun comes
up.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What the hell … oh, it’s you. Might’ve
figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I want my car.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You got the money?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar
bills. And this morning you was broke.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s none of your business. Get the
keys.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: I don’t want no dirty money. I run an
honest business.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the
keys?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: All I got’s a hundred, Darrell. You got
change?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Figgers. There’s a scratch on the hood and
how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Course you don’t. Tell me something Darrell.
Forty thousand people die every day! How come none of them are you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And the trunk key.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bobby? What the hell’s the matter with
you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I … nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock.
Hurt like hell.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I got the money all packed. I put the jeep
and his caddy in the garage. People’ll think maybe me and Jake went
away. Buy us some time…I know a back road we can take.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Good thinking. What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m not coming back.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Funny thing; the jeep wouldn’t start. I had
to push it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It should be just up ahead. Hold on … there!
There it is!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, God! I can’t believe it. I’m out. I’m
finally out!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You don’t know what it feels like to be free
of that place.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know about that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my
entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’ve still got some dead weight to get rid
of.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Can’t we just dump him fast someplace?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I want a place where only the vultures will
find him… It’ll be over soon, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Then will you take me on your friends’ boat
with you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not sailing his boat.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: But I thought –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re going to buy a boat of our own baby,
and sail it wherever we want to go.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell? Why not? Where should we
go?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hawaii. I’ve read all about it. I’ve dreamed
of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up
against my feet. Oh, God. I’d kill to go there.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You already have.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You know I thought you’d left me back
there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I love you Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re gonna pull this off, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, my God! Don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He must’ve seen us swerving on the road,
that’s all, just gonna give us a ticket for swerving…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Keep going!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuck this!…Just shut up, Grace. We done
nothing! Be cool. Let me do the talking. He doesn’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You had to fuck him, didn’t you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: OK…but he never made me cum! Really Virgil, I
was only doing what I had to do so we could be free. Just like we talked
about. It meant nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You fucking him too Grace? Is everybody
fucking everybody in this town?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You fuck this guy – get him to do your
dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No baby, you got it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: This road don’t go to Globe, Grace – where
were you going to meet me?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not like that it… Look, Virgil, I got
the money here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: All talk, that’s all you did was talk, and
all I did was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me! You
never did nothin’ Virgil, you’re weak! He did!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: This is some girl you and me got here
Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too, wouldn’t you say? … Course you
had a lotta practice haven’t you darling, going way back to your crazy
mama!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I don’t want the fuckin’ money! I’m not
gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It’s you. You
Grace or nothing. The whole thing… I want you to be my wife…. What do
you way Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You sound just like Jake… I did see into the
future, Virgil, but you weren’t in it. Go back to your family. They love
you.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Shut up, boy! You don’t know shit round
here! Get back. Did she tell you that story about the bird flying
away?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Stop! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: …But I bet the story she didn’t tell you
was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake was really her Papa. And
she liked fucking Papa! And now she’s killed the sonufabitch! Just like
she’s gonna kill you!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No…you! You!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace. No!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Help me get him off the road. Into the car!
We’ll ditch his car… Get the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and
me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He was in love with you Grace. He would’ve
done what you wanted, you could’ve made a deal and …</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The only deal he had in mind was killing you
for Jake’s murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest
of my life… no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He was a cop, Grace, they never stop looking
for you when you kill a cop…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He was a scumbag!… He wanted me, Bobby. These
guys don’t let go! Even when they’re dead… You don’t know what it was
like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So, aren’t you going to ask me?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ask you what? You mean what kind of
horrifying sick shit is coming next?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t you want to know…? I bet it’s burning a
hole in your brain just now?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let it go, baby. It’s the past. I got a
past…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t you really want to know? Was Jake my
Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don’t you want to know that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I
married him!… I married him…okay?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t know why!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: All I wanted was to be a kid… He took that
from me… They all did… They treated me like meat. A piece of meat. Fuck
me. Blow me. Bend over. Stick their fingers up my ass… Fuck them! Fuck
the whole town! They deserved to die!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And us Grace? What do we deserve?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s easy to judge someone else when you
don’t know nothing about it… I’m Apache, Bobby. You don’t eat what I
eat. You don’t see what I see. Don’t judge me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t want to think anymore.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: …Nobody’s sure where it was heading so fast
but the way it hit the semi, it won’t be getting home now! Hey area
weather is gonna be hot! Hot! Hot! Then cold! Cold! Cold! Just like
yesterday. Just like every day. Some surprise, huh? So if you’re
planning on anything, don’t. You don’t like the weather, just wait one
minute. Got any brains, get up to Alaska and get yourself some trailer
park where you don’t see no desert for miles and miles…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: See ya, Virgil. God bless.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No Grace, my hand’s bothering me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You think now that Jake’s dead, there’s all
that money there and I don’t need you anymore, and I might just sneak up
behind you sometime and…pop!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t you think I would’ve done it if I
wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You could give me my gun back.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why don’t we just finish what we started.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I think nothing happens. You’re dead meat.
That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You don’t believe in anything do you,
Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I believe in this moment, that’s all. There
is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you
motherfucker! Didn’t your Momma ever teach you anything…?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the
money, then you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t leave me. I want to say with you,
Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why? So when the cops catch up with us you
can sell me out again?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell
him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to
kill me!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies.
Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town
didn’t know you was his daughter?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: When you’re finished with me, I’m next! I
been there, baby. I been there with other cunts…sorry, not anymore. I’ll
take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you’re on
your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a
queen.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please,
I really want to be with you. Don’t blow this. Don’t you think I care
about you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I think you’re a lying, back-stabbing psycho
bitch, and one day you’ll kill me. But it’s nice to know you cared…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You don’t know your own mind. It blocks your
heart.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Give me a hand.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with the
sheriff over his wife. And both of ’em ended up dead.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Time to go for a walk, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: My mother died in this canyon.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It
doesn’t work with me. One, two, three…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look, it’s not so bad we split up. It might
be months before they find these guys. If at all. I mean with the
mountain lions around here. Remember, if they can’t find no bodies,
there’s no crime… We’ll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose this car, get
another one. Texas, Mexico are big countries, all that money Grace,
you’ll meet someone else, you know, there’s a lot of hope with a
$100,000…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hope is a four-letter word.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: But we all need that too. Hold him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You make a pretty couple.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows
who it’s registered to. You shoulda been more careful, Jake. See you
later.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Now all we got to do is try and–</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace! Help me, Grace…! We been through too
much together. We’ve only had one day, but you and me have been through
more than most people ever will. I know you were angry at me, and, you
know, you were right! I’m sorry I hit you. I was wrong about leaving
you. You don’t belong in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Thank you. Thank you. I…I knew you wouldn’t
leave me, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bobby? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I busted my leg!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Can you make it back up?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace – in the trunk of my car is a tow rope.
It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bobby, the trunk…it’s locked. Throw the keys
up to me. I’ll get the rope.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t throw that far. You got to climb down
here and get the keys. You can make it. It’s the only way Grace.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Grace!…Please, Grace! You have to help
me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Okay. I’m coming. Calm down!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: ’Cause I love you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And love’s a funny thing. Sometimes I don’t
know if I want to love you…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: …or kill you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I love you Grace, but I just can’t trust
you!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He can’t help you now, honey!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re still lucky.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You want somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You Harlin?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Nope. Darrell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Harlin around?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: He’s up at the Look Out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will he be back soon?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Doubt it. He’s dead. The Look Out’s a
cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You own this place?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then why do you call it Harlin’s?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: ’Cause Harlin used to own it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want to take a look at my car? I think the
radiator hose is–</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Damn. Gonna be another hot one today.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: That’ll make five in a row. Never seen it
so hot. Sometimes I don’t even want to get out of bed. I’d rather just
lay there and try to catch a breeze. I was in Mexico this one time–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, pal, I’ve got places to be. Could you
just take a look at my radiator hose. It’s busted.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: It’s your radiator hose. It’s busted.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know it’s busted. What did I just tell
you?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Well, you know so much why don’t you just
fix it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If I could do you think I’d be standing here
wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Somewhere else? Mister somewhere else is
fifty miles from here. How you planning on getting it there? You gonna
push this heap yourself?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, I’m stuck. You happy? Now can you fix
it, or not?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yeah, I can fix it. Gotta run over to the
yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna
take time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much time?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What time is it now?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Twenty-after-ten.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety
already.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Ninety-two. Only gonna get hotter. I
remember one time . . .</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Accident.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You got to be more careful. I remember one
time–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, right. Someplace in this dust bowl I can
get something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Truck stop up a piece. Not much, but us
simple folk like it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll be back in a couple of hours. And be
careful with her, will you?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Just a car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s not just a car. It’s a sixty-
four-and-a-half Mustang convertible. That’s the difference between you
and me, and why you live here and I’m just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Hey! You there!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want something, old man?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Don’t call me old man. Ain’t you got no
respect, boy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want something?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Yeah I want something. I want you to run
over to that machine and get me a pop.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can’t do that yourself?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Hell no, I can’t do that myself. I’m
blind. Can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t–</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: What’d you think I was doing out here
with these glasses on? Sunnin’ myself?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know. I thought you were keeping the
sun from your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I ain’t got no eyes. You want to see?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Christ no!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Lost my eyes on Okinawa. Lost them
fighting the war. Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come
around here and make fun of me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I said I was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Don’t be sorry. Just run over there and
get me my pop before I die of thirst.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, sure. You got change?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Change? You want my change? I fought the
war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All right, old man. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Get me a Dr. Peppa! I don’t want no
Pepsi. Pepsi ain’t nothing but flavored water.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Don’t forget to open it for me. I can’t
be opening my own bottle.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Ah! Just what I needed! Want some?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think you’d better give your pooch a sip. He
looks sick.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: That’s ’cause he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I hope you wasn’t pettin’ him none, was
you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What the hell are you keeping a dead dog
around for?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: He’s only just dead. What was I supposed
to do with him? I can’t take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take
him for me. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He no!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: See. Ain’t nothing I can do but keep him
here beside me. That’s where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that’s my
dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I
lost my eyes. He was just a pup then . . .</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can I give you a hand, beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m just going to my car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s right on my way.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: My mother told me never to accept offers from
strangers.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My name is John. Now I’m not a stranger
anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other,
beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do you have to call me that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know your real name.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Maybe I don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe, but if you didn’t I think you would
have kept on walking.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re pretty full of yourself, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My cup runneth over, beauti–</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s Grace.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: May I carry your package, Grace?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You sure you can manage?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do you want me to carry your pack for
you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Accident.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You should be more careful.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s very nice of you to help me. That
package is kind of heavy, and it’s so hot.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No trouble at all, really.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wasn’t nothing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, this isn’t my car. It’s down a ways. I
should have parked closer. I just didn’t think it would be so heavy. I
could drive up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s all right. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s just new drapes and curtain rods. If I
had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up
to the house.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s nothing. Really.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I just got tired of looking at the old
drapes. Had them long as I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That a fact?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I saw these in the Penny’s catalog, and I
just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you
had to have it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: ’Course they cost a little more than I should
really be spending. But, damn it, I don’t hardly ever do anything nice
for myself. I deserve nice things.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I . . . can’t . . . argue . . .</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re welcome, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re not from around here, are you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why you say that? Just because I help a lady
with her package?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You don’t have that dead look in your eyes
like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I just drove in this morning.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Drove into Sierra? What for?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Didn’t have a choice. My car overheated up the
road.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Good luck it didn’t happen a few miles back.
Maybe they never would have found you. Day like today you’d be dead for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, my luck. I get to be stuck out here in
this hole in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Least you can leave.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not until my car’s fixed. I don’t know how
long that’s going to take.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And here I’ve made you all hot and
sweaty.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I could use some help carrying this box into
the house. Not far. You could shower, get something cool to drink.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I could use something cool.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where you coming from?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately
Albuquerque.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’ve been around.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I guess I’ve got wander in my blood.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know. I have to make a stop in Vegas.
Business to finish. Then maybe I’ll head to Santa Barbara. I might be
able to pick up some work there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You just travel around, no direction, no
steady work. You must like taking chances.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If you’re going to gamble, might as well play
for high stakes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What happens if you lose?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I pack up and go somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Somewhere else. I’ve never been anywhere
else. Just once. Years ago. Went to the state fair. It was nice, but it
wasn’t nothing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I couldn’t stay in this place. I wouldn’t. I’d
just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sometimes I feel the exact same way.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I want my money.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I want my money.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I want my money.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thought you might like a refill on your
lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s good. Cools you right off. I saw you
watching me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I didn’t say it bothered me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Did you like it; me watching you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I guess. I’ve got an ego same as any man.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Good, ’cause I liked what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nice place you got here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by
herself in a big house.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I guess it must.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you do anyway?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I
tell fortunes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’d you learn to do that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: From my father. He was the tribe’s
Shaman.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A medicine man?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Those are white words, not ours.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nice house for a Shaman’s daughter. You must
be good.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There’s something in your past; something you
want to keep hidden. There’s a pain. Something . . . someone you can’t
forget. And there is something you want very badly. It seems very far
away to you, but you are determined, and you will do what you must to
get it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My face tell you all that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It tells me what every face tells me.
Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they
want. What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The same thing you do.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Really? I want to hang drapes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hold me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Tighter. I won’t break, but I sure don’t want
to fall.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There. All done. Lift me down.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Lift me down.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You can let go of me now. I’m safe. How do
they look.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like they’re made of polyester.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I like them. I was sick of looking at this
room. I think they add a little life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing like a little liveliness.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No more drapes to hang. Now what should we
do?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I have ideas.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All right, Grace. No more games.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Games?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead
me on, then slap me down. I don’t go for being jerked around.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Really? And what game did you want to play?
You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think I can find my own way back to into
town.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Maybe I like to find out about a man first.
Maybe I like to know what he’s made of.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few
memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that.
You read my fortune. Thanks for the lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You never did answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Still playing?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s not an answer. What is it you
want?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what I want.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Maybe I just want to hear you say it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grace!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake. I thought you would be at work,
dear.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who the hell is this!?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m her husband.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Husband . . .?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now who the hell are you, and it better be
good, or God help me I’ll break you in half.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I . . I was helping your wife. I met her in
town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Didn’t much look like you were hanging
drapes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I swear to you that’s all that happened. I
haven’t so much as set foot in your bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A lot that means.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grace, tell him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn it, Grace! Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If he says that’s what happened, Jake, it
must be true.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have half a mind to–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is this what it’s all about? You sucker me up
here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over
you? Forget it. You want to take my head off, Mister, I won’t even try
to stop you. I deserve it for being an idiot. But if you’re not, I think
I’ll be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get in, lad. I’ll give you a lift. It’s over
one-hundred degrees out there. Too hot to be walking.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come on, get in. If I was going to give you
trouble I would have done it already.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Accident.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ve got to be–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I know. More careful.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I guess we’ve never been introduced proper.
Jake McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jake McKenna. That’s a solid name.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m a solid man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: John Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What brings you to Sierra?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My car overheated. I pulled in to have it
fixed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve got to make a stop in Vegas, then I’m
heading to Santa Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Live there?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Got work. I know a man who’s got a boat. Wants
me to sail it for him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You a sailor man? That’d be the life. Drive
across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could
pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a
memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to
you after awhile.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I hope so. Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your
wife: If I had known she was married–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It wouldn’t have made a difference to you, now
would it? Not a wit. Do you know why? Because you’re a man without
scruples.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wait a second–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ah, I can smell it on you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s the sweat of a man who hasn’t an honest
bone in his body. Don’t be offended, lad. A man who’s got no ethics is a
free man. I envy you that. Beside, I can hardly blame you. That Grace
has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don’t she? Eh?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She does at that. I knew when I married her
she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was
I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you
don’t think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh?
Women.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can’t live with them, and you can’t shoot
’em.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I bet she led you on good, didn’t she? Taking
you up to the house with that smile of hers. Bet she wiggled her ass in
your face more than once. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Bet
you had a fire going under you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can
tell you got a temper on you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right
then, didn’t you? Bet you just wanted to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Would you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Would I what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Would you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I asked you a question.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why would I kill her?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Because I’m sick and tired of her little
games. Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one
would ever see you again. Because I’ve got a fifty-thousand dollar life
insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man
who does her in a good chunk of it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How do you know if you’ve never tried?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle
me. Right?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right. Nothing but a joke. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Enjoy your stay, lad.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This fucking town is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Got any cold soda?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Soda. You got any soda?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es
bien.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Soda. You know.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh. Something to eat. Si.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not eat. Drink. What the fuck is drink in
Spanish . . . uh, agua?</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: That’s right, lady. Keep it in you and nobody
gets hurt. That goes for you too, stud. Gimmie the money. Now!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: The dinero, Senora. Hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: That’s it? Lady, I got kids to put through
school.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Es all I have.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Okay, pal. The wallet.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Toss me the pack.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s nothing in it. Just books.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: I’m a reader. Toss it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: Hey man. Forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Senor, give him the pack.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: That’s all right. He doesn’t want to give me
the pack . . .</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: He’s fucking with you man. Shoot
him.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: He doesn’t have to give me the pack.</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: Fuck, man! Come on! Let’s get out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: Christ, man! Would you come on!</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: A little extra never hurt.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Now we go.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You go to El Diablo!</p>
<p><strong>second biker</strong>: Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Senor? Senor, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I call the policia.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No police.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But, Senor–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No police! Wait until I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Senor, you need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No police!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to
you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Don’t look like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just banged my head. It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Another accident? You got to be more
careful.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, I just want to pick up my car.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: She’s all yours. Put a new hose in it, and
she runs like a dream now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Well . . . parts, labor . . . let’s call it
a hundred-fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much!?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hundred-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: To replace a God damn radiator hose!?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: A God damn radiator hose in a sixty-
four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that
hose?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: About an hour and a half, because that’s all
the longer I’ve been gone.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: That’s about an hour and a half longer than
I usually spend looking for parts. You’re the one thinks that car’s so
damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to
tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: That’s not just a Ford, that’s a
sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s that got to do with the radiator
hose?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: I don’t know, but it’s the reason I’m
living here and you’re just passing through. Now you owe me a
hundred-fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars,
because I don’t have the money.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Then you ain’t gonna have the car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen, man. I got rolled half and hour ago
for everything I had.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A five is all I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Then you’re only a hundred-forty- five in
the hole. Now why don’t you just take your Visa Express Silver Card,
call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t have a credit card. They took my
wallet.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Now that’s too bad. I sure hope you know
how to wash dishes or shovel shit ’cause you’re gonna have to work this
one off.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my
hundred-forty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, operator. I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: Richie, how many times do I have to tell
you? You answer a phone hello, not yeah. You got no manners? What are
you, a fucking Neanderthal?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Vesci. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I have a collect call from John Stewart.
Will you accept the charges?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Mr. Vesci, it’s that deadbeat Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: He’s calling collect.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: John, what a surprise. I expected to be
seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know, Mr. Vesci. I know. I was on my way to
you, it’s just . . . what a day I’ve had. You’re not going to believe
what’s happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my
way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: That’s a shame, John. A real shame.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that’s
not the half of it. I’ve got your money, and I go into this little
grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: Let me guess. This robber; he gets your
money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. He gets shot by the old lady.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: The old lady?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: With a shotgun. It kills him, and it shreads
the money. I mean, what are the odds?</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: You’re the gambler. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I had to beat it before the cops showed up. I
don’t have a cent to my name. I can’t even get my car out of the garage.
I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren’t for bad luck I wouldn’t have any at
all. So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so
I could get my car. I’ll pay it back with the rest of the money.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: Let me get this straight: You owe me
thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire
you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A hundred-forty-five really.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me
you deadbeat, little punk: I don’t care if you got hit by a truck and
run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I
want it. I don’t care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my
desk tomorrow, or I’ll show you what real bad luck is.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: Do you understand me you little fuck?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, Mr. Vesci.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: And John, don’t make me come look for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vesci</strong>: Fucking kid. And look at you; breaking
fucking pencils. You’re a Neanderthal.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello? Hello!? Operator, I got disconnected.
Hello . . .</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Cici? Hey Cici, it’s John. Look, I know it’s
been a while, but I’m kind of . . . John Stewart . . . Yeah, look, I
know it’s been awhile, but I’m kind of in a jam . . . yeah . . .
One-hundred-fifty bucks . . . That’s a lie. I don’t only call you when I
need money . . . on your birthday . . . Two years ago . . . I can’t help
it if you didn’t get the message. Cici, I don’t want to argue. I really
need you to wire me the money . . . What do you mean serves me right . .
. I didn’t steal your CDs . . . Well, you still got my Mr. Coffee! Cici
. . . Cici, don’t hang up on me . . . Cici! Cici!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: God damn it! Shit! Damn! Damn! Damn!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Are you finished with your call?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Please deposit an additional seventy- five
cents.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Thank you for using AT&amp;T.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: One-hundred-thirteen degrees. That was back in
July of forty-seven. Now there ain’t no way it’s gonna be hotter than
that.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Hundred and eight already.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hundred and eight ain’t a hundred and
thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Will be.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You ain’t nothing but an old fool.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: You got two years on me. What’s that make
me?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Why don’t you both shut up and drink your
coffee? How you can drink that stuff on a day like today is beyond
me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He’s always going on about something. This
morning he wouldn’t shut up about that coin.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: What about a coin.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: It is not.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: A coin’s got two sides. When you flip it there’s
a fifty-fifty chance it’ll be heads or tails. Boyd thinks if you flip a
coin ten times half the time it’ll come up each side.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: It will.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No it won’t. You just don’t know shit about
statistics.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: And what are you? A rocket scientist?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I got more brains than you’ve got teeth.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Put your money where your chicken- lipped
mouth is. I’ll bet this mornings pay I’m right.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I ain’t wasting my money on something so
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: You two are like children.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll take a piece of that bet. I say it
doesn’t come up five times each side.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Well, a man with some gumption. How much money
you got?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: You want to make a kiddies bet?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll bet my watch against your pay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s a Movado.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Never heard of it. It’s got no day or date.
Hell, it ain’t even got numbers. What’s the matter? You couldn’t afford
a Timex?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Next city you’re in take it to a jeweler. He
won’t give you less than four-hundred for it.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: You’re on, Mister. You got a quarter, Ed?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I want that back when you’re finished.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Sugar, you officiate.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: I ain’t got time for this.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: It’ll only take a minute. Be a gal and help
out. Everybody ready? Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: One heads.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Two heads.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: One more. A tails is five and I get the watch.
Heads, and you is a rich man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Told you.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Stupid. Just plain stupid.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: You was right, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey! I won; fair and square.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thirty-bucks? That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: That’s my morning’s pay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m a rich man off of thirty bucks?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You are around here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is great. This is fucking great. I sit
here and watch you toss a coin, sweat my balls off, put a
thousand-dollar watch on the line for thirty fucking dollars?</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: I thought it was a lot of money. Ain’t that a
lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Now that you’re so well off, can I get you
something, Hon?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You got beer?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: What would a truck stop be without beer?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let me have a Beck’s.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: We ain’t got no Beck’s.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Kirin?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: No, we ain’t got no Kirin. We got Miller.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Genuine Draft?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: No. We got Miller. Regular Miller. You want it,
or don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, give me the Miller.</p>
<p><strong>short order cook</strong>: Flo, order up.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: I’ll be right back with that beer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A waitress named Flo. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fucking cat.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a
quarter?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Accident, and yeah, I got to be more
careful.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Got any requests?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That country shit all sounds the same to
me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How about I pick one out for you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How
come, I wonder, she don’t put out no more new records.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Gee, that’s sad. Don’t that make you sad?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve had time to get over it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re not from around here, are you? Where
you from?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oz.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You ain’t from Oz. Oz is in that one
movie.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re too quick for me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey! What are you doing with my girl?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I asked you a question.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Aw, Toby, we weren’t doing nothing. We was
just talking.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over
to our table. Now, I’m not going to ask you again, Mister. What were you
doing with my girl?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wasn’t doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s not the way it looked to me. Looked to
me like you was trying to make time with her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Make time? Is everybody in this town slap
happy?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter
for the jukebox.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man’s business
to take care of.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, pal, I wasn’t making a play for your
girl.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You expect me to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t care what you believe as long as you
leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mister, I’m calling you out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? You want to fight? Over her?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You know who I am? Toby N. Tyler. My friends
call me TNT. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They’re not very imaginative?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: ’Cause I’m just like dynamite. And when I go
off somebody gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now
I’m all scared, and I’ll never make that mistake again. Now go away.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Not before I settle with you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Christ, I don’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Stand up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wasn’t hitting on your girl!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Stand up, Mister, or I’ll beat you where you
sit.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Wait a second. What’s the matter with you two;
wantin’ to bash each other’s brains in? Take it outside. I don’t want
you bleedin’ in here.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Don’t you never mind, Flo. This is gonna be
over real quick.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re lucky, Mister. Don’t think it’s over. I
called you out and I’m gonna see this through. You hear me? Come on,
girl. I got half a mind to make you walk home.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he
sees is after his Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: More like Jenny is after every man she
sees.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: You pay Toby no mind. He just likes to show off
for his girl. Give him a couple of hours, he’ll cool off. Still want
that beer?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I’ll take it to go.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How’s it with you, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Already started out bad. Couple of guys
knocked over Jamilla’s grocery store. She killed one of them.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Poor thing. Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: ’Cept that she lost her money and the sons
of bitches stole her wedding ring. That’s when she started shooting.
Can’t blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: It’s this heat. That’s what it is. The heat
makes everybody crazy. Ain’t that right, Sheriff? People go crazy with
the heat.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I seen some bad ones in the heat. Once,
couple of years back on a white-hot day I had a woman went crazy. Her
little baby was so hot it kept cryin’ and cryin’ all day long. Husband
came home and ask where the baby is. Turns out the wife put it in the
freezer to keep it cool.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Lord! Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the
poor thing.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Baby didn’t die. Just froze off all it’s
finger and toes. Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now. But the
husband; he sees what the wife’s done, so after he saves the baby he
locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it. Now she
died.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What happened to the husband?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: State got round to frying him about a year
later. Two people dead, and one boy who won’t so much as be able to pick
his nose.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: It’s the heat, I tell you. Just gets
under a man’s skin and turns him crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Come on, Boyd. We got to make tracks. That
yogurts got to make Santa Fe before it spoils.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Here’s your beer, sugar.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Let me get your change.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Flo, I’m just gonna help myself to a refill
on the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: You be careful now, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Ned! Now look at what you done! Are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I think I burned my gun hand!</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: It’d serve you right. Jose, run get a mop and
clean this mess up.</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Shasta! Now why’d you go and scare the nice man
like that? Sorry about that, hon. Enjoy your beer, and try to have a
nice day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn it! God Damn it! I hate this fucking
town! Do you hear me? I hate it! I got to get out of here. I got to get
out of this place.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thank you, Tracy. Why don’t you take
lunch?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good Lord. What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just ran into a little trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Another accident? You’ve really got to be more
careful. Can I get you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m surprised to see you. I thought you’d be
halfway to Vegas by now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I had a problem getting my car back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You just seem to attract trouble, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nice office you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I do all right. Real estate isn’t a bad game
such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when
you buy it, and overvalue when you sell. You can turn a few dollars that
way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Isn’t that illegal?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was hoping we could talk.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Talk? About what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: About things. About your wife.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sweet Grace? What about her?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: About what you said this morning.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You said you had an insurance policy out on
your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You said you’d cut that up with the man who
did her in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t play simple with me, Jake. You want me
to spell it out for you? I’ll kill Grace if you cut me in on the
money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I think this heat’s getting to you the way
you’re rambling on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not rambling.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re talking like a mad man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re the one who brought it up. This
morning. In your car.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That was just loose talk. I don’t want anybody
dead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A man doesn’t always mean the things he
says.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You meant it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because I think you’re a slimy bastard who
would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And what does that make you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The slimy bastard who’s going to do it for
you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let’s say I do want her dead. What is it you
want? This morning you weren’t a killer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This morning I didn’t know how badly I’d want
to get out of this fucking town.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And for that you’d kill Grace?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: For that I’d kill a nun on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just to get out of here? That doesn’t seem
much for a murder.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How do you put a price on murder?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your
cut, of course. Which is?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Make it twenty.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Twenty-thousand? I don’t have that kind of
money. I won’t get the insurance until months after she’s dead. I don’t
imagine you’ll want to be around after poor Grace’s demise.
Twenty-thousand; that’s more money than I could ever get my hands
on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much could you get?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe . . . ten-thousand. And that’s a
maybe.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s a bit much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re not buying a car, for Christ sake.
You’re having your wife killed. I’m the one who’s neck is stuck out.
It’s thirteen, or it’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling
you were my boy when I met you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not your boy, Jake. I don’t like you, and
I don’t like what you are. I got no choice but to do business with you.
This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t say that. I had a marriage of
convenience with Grace, and look where that’s lead. Well, looks like we
got ourselves a pact.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do we shake hands?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If you can’t trust the man you’ve hired to
kill your wife . . .?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I guess I might as well get this done
with.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The sooner it’s over, the sooner you’re on
your way. Now listen to me: It’s got to look like an accident; that’s
the thing. If it doesn’t, then it’s no good. I won’t get a dime, and
it’s my neck that’ll be on the chopping block while you’re living it up
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How the hell should I know? I’ve never had a
wife killed before. I guess I should have hired a professional.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want to do this yourself? I don’t have to
do this, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Be quiet, boy. I’m thinking. It can’t be done
at the house. It should be . . .</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This is what you do: Go to the house to see
her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And tell her what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t know. Tell her you had to see her.
Tell her you don’t care if she’s married or not, you had to be with her.
Sweet talk the woman. A stud like you must be good at that. Then . . .
maybe shift the conversation. Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.
She loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does love. She’ll want to
take you for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She’ll take you out somewhere in the desert.
She loves it out there; ridin’ through the red rock and the mesas. So do
I. I guess we got that in common. She’ll ride you out someplace quiet.
Someplace deserted.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There won’t be anyone for miles around. Just
the two of you and some prairie dogs. That’s all. You can sweet talk her
a little if you like. Makes no mind to me. Just put her at ease, make
her feel relaxed, then do it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Doesn’t the heat bother you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a
reservation. The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.
Jake’s the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we’re alike that way.
That’s about the only way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You love him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Did you ever?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Depends on what you call love. When I was
growing up I had nothing. I learned to want everything. I wanted more
than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket. He’s not much; he’s older than
me, different than me, but he’s got more money than half this town put
together. I courted him. I let him think he was courtin’ me, but I
reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he
could give me, and I would’ve done anything to get him. Is that
love?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m guessing no.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, I guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And I take it things didn’t much work out the
way you planned.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m still here, aren’t I? See this?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: All this nothing? I’ve spent my life in this
stinking desert. It doesn’t get to Jake like it got to me. He doesn’t
mind being out here. He doesn’t mind being nothing but a land broker.
Big fish in a small pond, he says. More like a little fish in a dried up
watering hole.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You could just leave him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You just walk away.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not that easy. Maybe you can take
chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you
please. I can’t. I don’t want to be alone. I need to know I’m going to
be taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some
guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that so bad? It’s not like I wouldn’t try
to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would . . . do things
for him. I guess I’m no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you
along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn’t blame you if you did.
But maybe it’s like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to
get out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whatever it takes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I wish I was a bird. I know it’s stupid.
Every child says that. When I was growing up some of the old ones on the
reservation believed people could actually change into animals. I wish I
could.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to
Disney World. I always wanted to go there. I’d fly to New York. Maybe. I
guess New York isn’t the best place to be a bird. I’d fly to St. Louis,
then New Orleans, all over Texas. Then I’d fly to California. I guess by
then I’d have seen it all and I could die.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They say you don’t feel anything. The shock
kills you before you hit the ground. I don’t know how they would know
that. But I heard it’s just like flying; straight down into the ground.
I guess if it doesn’t hurt it’s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hate’s a funny thing. Right now I bet you
don’t know if you want to kill me, or fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How far is it to California?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: From here? I don’t know. Far. Far enough.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Have you ever been there before?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is it pretty?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and
clear skies as far as you can see.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Take me with you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Please. I won’t hang on you. As soon as we
get there you can dump me. I don’t care. I just want to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grace, I can’t. I can’t even get out of here
myself. I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy
mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know where we could get the money. A lot
more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You think Jake’s going to give me money just
so I can take you out of here?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He doesn’t give it to us. We take it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: From?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He’s got money. In a floor safe in the living
room. I’ve never seen it, but he talks about it all the time. More like
brags. He loves his money. Wouldn’t think of spending some of it on
me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You live pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much money has he got?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Near as I can figure must be about a
hundred-thousand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of- a-bitch
lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Lied? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I . . . nothing. Just something he said. So if
the money’s in a safe we’d have to get the combination–</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not a combination lock. It takes a key.
He keeps it on him all the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up
against me when we do it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If the key’s on him, to get the key we’d have
to . . .</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We’d have to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John? John where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think this heat is making me crazy. I was
crazy to come back here, I’m crazy for listening to anyone in this town,
and I’d sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this
place.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John, please–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know what I was thinking, but I can’t
do it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Kill someone. I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is it so bad? It would be quick. He wouldn’t
even have to feel it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sometime in the middle of the night; when
it’s quiet. When he’s asleep. You just come up behind him and . . .</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not like he’s a young man. He’s had time
to live.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus Christ! Listen to yourself! I can’t do
it, Grace. I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John! I grew up on a reservation. A fucking
patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That’s where they stick
Indian’s, John. That’s where they leave us to die. My mother died there.
My father. I had a brother who killed himself at twenty-two because he
couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There’s no hope there, John. I was lucky to
make it this far. You’ve got to do this for me. I’ll do anything for
you. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How are you going to get out of here? You
need the money. It’s not so much for a hundred-thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Whatever it takes, remember? Whatever it
takes.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: It’s the heat that makes you crazy. I
don’t know what it is, but it works that way for man and animal alike. I
seen some peculiar things on a hot day. I seen a scorpion sting itself
to death. It just keeps driving its tail into its body again and again.
A little killer killing itself. Seen a coyote kill itself too. Just kept
on biting and tearing at its own legs. Near tore one clean off before it
bled to death. And what a man’ll do when it’s hot . . . A man could get
hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders with another. I don’t know
what it is about the heat. I figger it’s sort of like putting a kettle
of water over a fire. People is mostly water. We boil when it’s hot.
’Cept when we boil the water’s got no place to go. It just churns inside
of us until we can cool off. If it’s not too late.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You sure seen a lot for a blind man.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Just ’cause I ain’t got eyes doesn’t mean
I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That a fact?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I can see just fine. For example: You’re
a young man who thinks he’s got someplace to be.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe I do.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Or maybe you just think you do. You can
run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think I’ve heard that before.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: What do you want for free?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: That’s ’cause I’ve done a lot of
living.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe one day I’ll get to sit on a corner and
spout wise.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Think you’ll live that long?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Ain’t you got a little something for the
infirm?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m a little short. I’ll catch you next
time.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I won’t hold my breath.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I went to your place. We talked, just like you
told me. We drove out into the desert . . .</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is the job done?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You didn’t kill her?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The time wasn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re out in the desert, the middle of
nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn’t right?
What’s the matter? You were hoping to get it on home video? A keepsake
for the grandkids. Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it
on tape.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know all right. I know you’re just enough of
a shit to have a go at bedding a man’s wife. You’ve probably bagged a
few at that. You’d probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.
From that you’d just turn and walk away. But to kill; to get that blood
on your hands. You can’t wash that off. You’d be a marked man for life.
Just like Cain. And you’re a sinner who wants to walk with the saints.
Ain’t that right, boy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know so much about killing why don’t you
do it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I guess I have what you’d call a love-hate
relationship with Grace.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You love her, but you hate her?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I hate loving her. I hate the kind of her
person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays. I
hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise. And I
certainly love her too much to kill her. I couldn’t stand to watch her
eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her
pretty pink brains spill from her skull. But you? You got the killing in
you, boy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Came close this time and it scares you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Drop it, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And next time, next time somebody is going to
get dead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: SHUT UP!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Like I said: Next time somebody’s going to get
dead. Best make sure it ain’t you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s not going to be a next time. Nobody’s
going to get killed. Not by me. Sorry we couldn’t do business. I’m
getting kind of used to this place. Maybe one day you could sell me a
retirement plot.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do
the job?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thirteen-thousand dollars. Had you done it.
Isn’t that what we agreed on?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You think that’s a lot of money?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All I have in the world.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s what I like about you, Jake. You’re an
honest man.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, Mister. Mister. I just. . . I just
wanted to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: For defending my honor this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn’t
defending you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: But you was going to fight for me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wasn’t going to fight for you. I was just
going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He’s not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take
me out and stuff, but I ain’t spoken for. Not yet that is.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get it through your head, little girl; I’m not
going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I’d marry him.
You’re not going to get much better in this town.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s what I thought until you came riding
in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It’s cool. Want to take me
for a ride? Desert’s kind of lonely this time of day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Eighteen. Well, I’m gonna be eighteen in two
years, but that don’t mean you can’t take me for a ride if you want.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I don’t want to take you for a ride. What
I want is for . . . Hey, you don’t happen to have a hundred and fifty
dollars I could–</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mister!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s right, Mister. You better be afraid. I
told you it wasn’t over, but you didn’t listen. Now I find you sneakin’
around with my girl behind my back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wasn’t sneaking around with your girl. Would
you please tell him?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re too late, Toby. We’re going to get in
his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s your name anyway?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, that tears it, Mister. I’m gonna bust you
up but good. I’m gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and
then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all
around. That’s what I’m gonna do. You don’t know what you’re dealing
with, Mister. I’m crazy. I’m psycho crazy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I know. You’re TNT. Just like dynamite.
When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let’s do this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Toby Tyler, it don’t matter to me if you beat
him all up and knock out all his teeth and he’s just drooling and
bleeding all over hisself, ’cause we love each other and we gonna run
off, and I’m gonna have his love child.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will you shut up!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You gonna pay for that, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Toby!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sheriff Potter.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Toby, I just came from your mother’s place.
She’s worried sick about you. She says she ain’t seen you since this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That ain’t true, Sheriff. I was home for
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Boy, I’m not trying to hear nothing from
you except that you’re heading home. Now run along.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, sir. Come on, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I want to stay.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I said come on!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Bye, Mister. Don’t go nowhere without me. I
wanna have your love child.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Next time, Mister. Next time.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Kids.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. What are you going to do? That Toby’s a
hot head.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: He is at that. No so much a fault of his
own. Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: His father worked in a strip mine north of
here. Toby’s school class went up to the mine one day. School takes
field trips up there every year. Big day for the kids when they can see
ore tore up out of the ground. Anyway, on this particular day Toby’s dad
up and falls into the machinery.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yep. Tore him up good and spat out little,
refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your
father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young
man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Like I said; you really can’t blame the
boy. Some people don’t know how to avoid trouble. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Saw you at the truck stop this morning.
You’re not from around here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, sir. And I’m not going to be around long
if that’s what you’re worried about.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Just curious. That’s a nasty cut you’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not as bad as it looks.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: There was a young man over at Jamilla’s
today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of
the robbers.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wouldn’t know anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That’s too bad. I was hoping you were
there. Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away. Or maybe you
could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot
that biker.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wish I could help, Sheriff. But if you’ll
excuse me I’m going over to Harlin’s to pick up my car. Then I’m getting
the hell out of this place.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Stay as long as you like, son. No rush.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I’ve
had my fill of your little town.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hey there. I was beginnin’ to think you
wasn’t comin’ back. You don’t look so good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well, I’ve been around the bend a
bit.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: One of those days you feel like you been
runnin’ in circles and you ain’t no closer to where you tryin’ to get
than when you started?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’ve been there?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Hell, I’ve had days I would gladly trade
with a whippin’ dog. Ain’t much you can do when you feel like that ’cept
tough it out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You think bad, and bad is what you get.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s a good piece of advice, Darrell.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: No charge.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty
bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I’m going I swear I’ll–</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Two-hundred.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: It’s going to cost you two-hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You said this morning the hose was going to
run me one-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone I
replaced a gasket. That’s going to run you another fifty.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I didn’t tell you to replace any gasket.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yeah, but it was shot.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I didn’t tell you to do it! You can’t just do
unauthorized work.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Well, now, you just know all there is about
bein’ a mechanic, don’t you? I can’t do unauthorized work. I suppose I
can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an
accident and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna
blame me, and there goes my reputation.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What reputation? You’re nothing but an
ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Is that an insult? Are you insulting
me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Take it. As soon as I get my money. Fifty
dollars for an almost new gasket. You don’t know what kind of a deal
you’re getting.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m taking my car, and I’m taking it now!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You listen to me, you fancy city man. You
owe me money, and this car ain’t going nowheres until I get it. And if
you take another five hours I’ll find another fifty dollars worth of
work to do on her. Now get out of here! You’re stinking up my
garage.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You want to play, Mister? I’ll play with
you. You want to smash something? So do I.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What’s the matter? The fight gone out of
you? I’m just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please, just leave the car alone.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Yeah, you better remember that.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Get on out of here. And you better come up
with my money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Goddamn you! You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: There you go, sweet talking me again.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ve got the killing in you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe not this time, but somebody’s going to
get dead around you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Out of here.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: But, in particular?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I . . . Mexico. You got a bus that goes to
Mexico? That’s where I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Where in Mexico would you like–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t care, just get me there.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: We have a bus to Mexico. Arrives in two
hours. Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across
the border.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: One way, or round trip?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One way.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Thirty even.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Twenty-seven, fifty. That’s all I got.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The ticket is thirty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I bought a beer. That was two- fifty. I bought
a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. It’s thirty dollars for the
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Just a little short. Figures. I just
wanted to get out, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please, you don’t understand. I have to get
out of here. They’re going to come looking for me. They’re going to kill
me. If I can’t get this ticket then I’m going to have to do things to
get out of here. I don’t want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’ll give you the money! Okay? I’ll give you
two-fifty. Just . . . just, please.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Here. Bus three-twenty-three. Gets here in
two hours.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just . . . the heat . . .</p>
<p><strong>we see a quick montage of john waiting for the bus.
the</strong>: PICTURE BLENDS SHOTS OF HIM STANDING, SITTING, RECLINING
ON THE BENCH. OVER THIS WE HEAR:</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Two hours. Two hours and you’re free. Mexico’s
not so bad. You’ll makes some money, pay Mr. Vesci back. Throw in a
little interest. He’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Get up, Mister! Don’t ever let it be said Toby
Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair
chance.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What the hell are you doing? Are you
crazy?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m doing what any man would do if he’d been
offended. I’m beating you up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You stupid punk! You don’t even know what
you’re fighting over!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: My honor, that’s what I’m fighting over. Now
get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Toby! Toby Tyler, leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up,
and that ain’t a thing for a woman to see.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t be afraid of him none. I don’t care
what he does to you, we can still be together.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Now, what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mexico? You’re going to Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m leaving. You never have to see me again.
Just please, give me the ticket!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: This means something to you? Jenny means
something to me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin’
nothing but soup the rest of your days. Rain dogs is gonna be prettier
than you when I’m done. I’m gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your
own momma sick. I’m gonna . . .</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stop it! You’re killing him!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re killing him! Toby!? Toby!?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello, Grace? It’s John.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I thought you would be on your way to Vegas
by now. Is there something you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wanted to talk.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t think we have anything to talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What about us?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There is no us, remember?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Except I can’t get you out of my head,
Grace.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve thought about you every second since I
left. I can still taste you on my lips.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth
scare you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Because I know you’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I mean it, Grace. I’m getting out of here, and
I want to take you with me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I thought you couldn’t leave. I thought you
couldn’t get your car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I could if I had Jake’s money.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that what changed your mind? The
money?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t give a damn about the money. I want
you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There’s only one way to
do that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Are you sure? About me, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I came back for you; this morning I came back.
Before I even knew about the money. You’re what I want.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The only reason I stormed off is because you
sort of spooked me talking about Jake. But I’ve had nothing but time to
think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the
hell out of here. But we’ve got to get the money, baby. We get the
money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You said you couldn’t kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We don’t have to kill him. Just knock him out
and tie him up ’till we get away.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It was your idea, remember? I’m doing this for
you. I’m doing this so you can fly.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grace . . . Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: After dark. I’ll leave the back door
unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who was that on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You spent a long time talking for a wrong
number. But then you make friends so easily. Don’t you, Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I put up new drapes, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know. I was here when your apprentice was
helping you. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You never said anything. About the
drapes.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They look nice.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You haven’t even looked at them once.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They look nice.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought
you would like the colors.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh-huh</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What the hell you looking at, girl?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Well, that’s it. Sun’s going down. People
go home, trade stories over dinner. They’ll talk about the day, about
the heat, laugh about something crazy it made them do. They’ll kiss,
sleep a few hours, then do it all over again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The day wasn’t so bad. We all got through it
all right.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Ain’t over yet. Night is part of day;
separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see
things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re a hell of a pessimist, old man.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Night is when you want to sleep, but the
dry heat keeps you tossin’ and turnin’. It’s when you wish the sun was
bakin’ high in the sky so you could see what it is you’re afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You afraid of the dark?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark.
People are afraid of what they can’t see. I can’t see nuthin’, so it’s
all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog. The
kiss of death. It’s all the same.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t fear death?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: We was born to die, boy. From the minute
you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your
head. You just don’t know where, or when, or how. Don’t make sense
worryin’ about the particulars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re all just floating along like twigs in a
stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: More or less.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not this twig, friend. I got plans.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: We all got plans. I planned on seeing all
my life. I know you didn’t plan on straying into town.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No and I don’t plan on sticking around either.
I don’t guess I’ll be seeing you again. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Same back at you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Any parting words of wisdom?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Things ain’t always the way they seem.
You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You talk too much, old man.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Cheap bastard.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What the hell you doin’, Grace? Are you coming
to bed, or aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You didn’t hear something?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How could I? I was sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s someone in the house.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t hear anything. You were dreaming. Or
maybe the wind blew something over.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The wind isn’t blowing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake, what is that?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What does it look like?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: When did you buy a gun?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh my God, Jake, no. If it is someone they’ll
go away. Or call the police. Don’t go out there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you afraid of? I’m the one’s got the
gun. Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake. No. No!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, well. As I live and breath. I didn’t
expect to be seeing the likes of you again. Thought you’d be long on
your way by now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well, me too.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Trouble with the car again?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You could say. I don’t even have it yet.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Darrell giving you problems?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He did more work on the car. He wants fifty
bucks extra for it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Fifty dollars more. That’s a lot of money when
you don’t have a dime. And where’d you plan on getting the money from?
Maybe you thought you’d pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe you heard old Jake’s got some money
stashed away and you thought you’d help yourself to a little.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wait a minute. Just listen to me–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You thought you’d come in here in the middle
of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his
brains into wall paper.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jake–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And then with Jake out of the way you could
borrow two-hundred dollars. Or maybe two-thousand. Or twenty-thousand.
Who’s to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, ’cause old Jake would be dead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s not the reason I’m here. I swear
it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s another reason? It better be good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I came for Grace.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You came to take my wife from me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I came to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s the truth, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s a thick change of heart.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about
killed some guy over a girl. Not for money, for a girl. And she was just
going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me. Same way
Grace played us this morning. I don’t like that, Jake. Not twice in one
day. And maybe I’m so pissed I’d twist the next off my own Grandma to
get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s a lot of talk. A whole lot of talk.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn it, Jake. If I don’t get out of here some
guys are going to come gunning for me. And if it comes down to me or
Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.
Give me two- hundred. I’ll kill her and dump the body where no one will
ever find it. But I need the money. I’ve got to have the money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She’s in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hold a second. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m curious about something. I’m wondering
just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom’s at.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wh . . . what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This morning when I came in on you and Grace,
you swore you hadn’t so much as been near the bedroom. Now you make
straight for it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, Jake–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t Jake me, boy! It’s a big house. Odd that
you would know your way, except maybe you’ve been in the bedroom before.
Maybe with Grace to keep you company.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing happened with me and Grace this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then maybe this afternoon. When I sent you to
kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Christ, Jake, please–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is that what happened? Did you even make it
out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my
sheets?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re not talking sense.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sense? If I had any sense I would have killed
you this morning and been done with it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you . . . you can’t . . . you can’t
kill me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?
Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.
Only this old man’s got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use
it. A man’s got to protect his home. His wife. You’re dead, boy, and
your own mother wouldn’t convict me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What difference does it make if I slept with
her. You don’t care about Grace.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re right. I don’t give a damn about her.
But to fuck a man’s wife behind his back? That just makes a fool out of
him. I don’t like being made a fool of.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t blame you. What man would? I admit it,
okay? I came back here and I made it with Grace. But if you kill me
you’re making a big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not from where I stand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s not me you have to worry about. It’s her.
She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your
money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you babbling about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Think about it. How do you think I got in
here? Did you hear any glass break? Did you hear a door splinter? How
did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit? Maybe
just long enough to leave the back door unlocked? Is that what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’d tell me anything to save your pathetic
life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what kind of woman Grace is. You know
how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra. What makes you think
when you were planning on killing her she wasn’t doing the same for you?
What’s she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead? Let me kill
her. All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Two-hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Two-hundred dollars . . . that’s how I put a
price on murder.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I think not. Killing my wife for me; that’s
one thing. But fucking her . . . well, that’s another.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake! No!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why the hell didn’t you do anything?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You could have hit him, or kneed him in the
balls.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Christ! You liked watching that, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The money!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s the safe?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t know? Jesus Christ! Don’t you think
you should have found out before we killed him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m not sure where it is. Not exactly. I
never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, that’s great. We killed Jake because you
heard him talk about some money that you’ve never seen. That’s fucking
brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t yell at me!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Right here. Six steps out, three steps left.
That’s where I heard him say.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go get a knife, or something.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I got it! It’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing. There’s no safe under here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There has to be!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There isn’t! There’s nothing under here but
more floor. Jesus fucking Christ! We killed a man for nothing but
floor.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s got to be here. I heard him talk about
it. He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is good. This is real good. This is so
good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.
They’ll probably just lock us up for being idiots.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If it isn’t here, why would he wear that
stupid key?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re calling Jake stupid? You!?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t yell at me! I know it’s here! I know
it!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wait. Wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jake’s taller than you. He takes bigger
steps.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give me the knife.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The key!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look at it all, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s easily a hundred-thousand in there.
More than that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I told you. I knew it was there. Didn’t I
tell you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We’ll split it right down the middle.
Fifty-fifty. You don’t have to take me with you. You can go your own way
if you want.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If you want.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re going all the way. Together.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s go in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let’s do it here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let him watch. I want him to know what he’s
missing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You got a suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Never needed one. I’ve never been anywhere.
I’ve got a backpack.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up
anything else you want to take with you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: To get my car.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wait. What about . . . him?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Put some clothes on him. When I get back We’ll
load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert. It’ll takes days for
anybody to find him.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What you want?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: We’re closed. Come back in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It is morning.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Come back when the sun comes up.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: What the hell . . . oh it’s you. Might’ve
figured. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I want my car.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: You got the money?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar
bills. And this morning you was broke.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: I don’t want no dirty money. I run an
honest business.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my
keys?</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: I think you know where to find her.</p>
<p><strong>darrell</strong>: By the way, I topped off the tank for you.
No charge. Just my friendly way of doing business.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn it! God damn it! I knew she was going to
do this to me. Damn her! Damn her!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John!? What the hell’s the matter with
you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I . . . nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a
rock. Hurt like hell . . . that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I got the money all packed. I put the jeep in
the garage. Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went
away. Might buy us some time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Good thinking.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Had push it in. Funny thing; it wouldn’t
start.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Funny thing.</p>
<p><strong>[three pages (105 to 107) missing from script]</strong>:
————————————————————</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Mrs. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Nice night for a drive. Morning really. I
guess that’s about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top
down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of
town.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Suppose you’ve had all you can of Sierra.
What with that ruckus you had with Toby. Oh yes, I heard all about
that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sheriff, he didn’t give me any choice. If I
hadn’t defended myself- -</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Just cool down, son. I ain’t accusing you
of anything. Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn’t
done it, somebody else would’ve.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Nope. No problems up the road.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That yours, Mrs. McKenna?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes. Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Taking a little trip?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I had a fight with Jake. I . . . I just
wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as
far as Montrose. I’m going to take a bus to my sister’s. I thought I’d
stay with her for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Is that right? Can’t say as I blame you for
wanting to head out for a bit. I know I’ve had my fill of this town.
Sixteen years I’ve been the law and order here. So long I forgot why I
ever wanted the job in the first place. Help people, I guess. Keep the
peace. Problem is there’s so much peace around here they don’t much need
me. Got a lot of speeders, but they’re speeding through miles of nothing
so I can’t hardly blame them. Other than that, well, there ain’t much to
steal. I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say
Mrs. McKenna? A murder?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I . . .</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Why don’t you step out of the car, son?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t understand what the–</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Just step from the car. Nice and slow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now step around to the back of the car and
open the trunk for me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I think you might just want to do as I
say.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: And as soon as I see that you’re on your
way.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John . . .?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grace! Just . . . let me handle this. Sheriff,
I’m telling you there’s nothing in that trunk. If that’s not good enough
for you, then I’d be happy to open it. Just as soon as you get yourself
a search warrant.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I could do that. ’Course we’d have to go
back into town. There’d be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk
was opened. A whole crowd of witnesses. That wouldn’t be too pretty, now
would it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John . . .</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Go on. Pick ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Is that the way you want it, boy? A bullet
in the head in the middle of the desert? Ends like this and you won’t be
able to spend a dime of that blood money.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He killed him, Sheriff! I couldn’t stop him!
He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me
too.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You bitch! You were in on it froom the
start!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Shut up! The both of you. Ain’t neither one
of you too smart. Especially you, boy. Don’t you think I had my eye on
you since first you rolled into town? You smell like trouble. Stink of
it like a ripe cesspool.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Killing Jake McKenna’s got to amount to
something. He wasn’t much of a man, but that don’t give you the right to
murder him. And don’t tell me you didn’t, ’cause I know you did. I was
there. Like I said; I been watching you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sheriff Potter, please. I can’t go to jail. I
wanted no part of it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You liar! You wanted him dead. You seduced me
into killing him!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: For the love of God would you two give it a
rest? Lord almighty. In all my years I have never seen anything so
pathetic. How far did you think you were going to get with this? Neither
one of you can wait to slit the others throat. Now use what little
smarts you got. If I was going to bust you I wouldn’t have waited until
after you killed Jake.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Same thing you want. I want to be out of
Sierra; to be able to do as I please. But that takes money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s what this is all about? A shakedown?
You picked the wrong people. We don’t have any money.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Sure you do. Everybody in town knows about
the money Jake kept hid in the house. It’s a wonder the Mrs. here just
now got round to killing him. Not for lack of trying.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What’d you think, boy? That you were the
first man to drift through this town she came on to? Not by a long shot.
You’re just the most gullible. How much did you get?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thirty-thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You ain’t passing these test, son. If I
can’t trust you I’m gonna have to arrest you . . .</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: . . .at the very least. I know there was
more than thirty-thousand dollars. Now, how much did you get?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t tell him anything. He can’t do
this.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Can’t I? You’re out in the desert, all
alone, with a body in your trunk. What do you think, boy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One-hundred-thousand dollars. A little
more.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Damn you! What did you do that for? He can’t
prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut
so I could go to a hanging alone.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Nobody’s going to hang. We’re all gonna
walk away with a little something. I ain’t a greedy man. And, hell, you
did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars. Split that three ways
and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand. Give or take.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And you’re taking?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s all talk. He’s got nothing on us. He
let you kill Jake.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not me. Us.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It doesn’t matter. He was there and he let it
happen. He can’t take us in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give him the money.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You heard me. Count it out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He can’t prove anything, John. He can’t turn
us in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He can kill us. I don’t know about you, but my
life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: There you go, Mrs. McKenna. Just put it in
there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do it, Grace!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That wasn’t so bad. What’s thirty-
some-thousand to rich folks like you? It didn’t hurt a bit.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sheriff Potter.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Get in the fucking car!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What the hell did you do?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I shot him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You killed him!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He was going to take the money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thirty-thousand, that’s all. We would have
been free and clear. You didn’t have to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s our money. He had no right to take
it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re crazy, you know that!? You’re fucked
up!?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I said drive!</p>

We can now clearly make out John who sits on the edge of the driver’s
seat, feet dangling out the open door and head buried in his hands.
Grace is reclined in the passenger seat. She is asleep, covered with her
jacket. We can just barely hear the crackle of a voice over the
radio.</p>

so fast, but the way he hit the semi-truck he won’t be getting here now.
Hey, I got area weather. It’s gonna be hot, hot, hot. Just like
yesterday. Just like everyday. Some surprise, huh? Weather man says it’s
going to top one-hundred again, so if you have to go outside, don’t.
makes you want to look into some retirement property in Alaska. Here’s
some news from around the area. Over in Sierra, that sleepy little town
was tocked last night by the murder of a police officer. Authorities say
they haven’t yet made any arrests, but they have leads and hope to bring
in suspects within–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus, Grace. Did you have to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He was going to–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know. He was to take the fucking money.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re tense. What are you all uptight
about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You killed a man for no reason!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that what’s bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You think now that Jake is dead, there’s all
that money there and I don’t need you anymore I might just sneak up
behind you sometime and . . .</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that the kind of girl you think I am? What
can I do to make you relax?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You could give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why don’t we just finish what we started.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Christ, Jake. You need a bath.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give me a hand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are we going to dump him, or not?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: On three. Ready? One, two–</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You hit me. You hit a woman. Didn’t your
momma ever teach you anything?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you’re
on your own.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: But you said we could be together.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you kidding? I’m not going down with you
for killing a cop.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What difference does it make? You killed
Jake.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He was a crooked bastard. He would have
killed us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The police don’t know that. And it’s going to
be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck. I’ll take
you as far as California. If we can even make that. After that I’m
cutting you loose.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: But I want to say with you,</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can
try and sell me out again? You take your hald of the money and run. You
might want to try Mexico. With all that dough you’ll live like a
queen.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t want to go to Mexico, John. I want to
be with you. Don’t you think I care about you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think you’re a lying, back stabbing bitch.
But it’s nice to know you care.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, Jake. Time to go for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Poor, old Jake. Had a fight with his wife, a
few too many drinks, wandered out into the desert and fell off a cliff.
You got to be more careful, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, this is where we part company.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You should’ve just let me go into the bedroom.
I would have killed for you. Now look at yourself. Oh, well. Bye bye,
and thanks for the loan.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now all we have to do is try and–</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John . . . John!?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grace!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think I busted my leg.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Can you climb back up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t make it. Grace? Grace!?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grace, listen to me. In the trunk of my car is
a rope. It should reach down here. Got get it, throw it down and I’ll
climb up.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John! Can you hear me? Are you still
there?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where the hell am I going to go?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John, you have to throw the keys up to
me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John, throw me the keys.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The trunk. It’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s not locked. I left it open when I took
out Jake’s body.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s . . . it’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You closed it, didn’t you, Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I was going to back the car to the ridge and
pull you up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bullshit, Grace. You were going to drive off
and leave me here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No. I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And you’re not one to lie, are you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Throw me the keys and I’ll pull you up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why don’t you come down and get them so I can
wring your pretty little neck?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John, if you don’t throw me the keys, then
I’ll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Walk to where? We’re fifty miles to the
nearest town. It’s going to be over one-hundred degrees today. How far
do you think you’re going to get?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Someone will find me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, they’ll find you. Dried up and twice
dead.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You idiot! You’ll kill us both!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: At least I’ll have company when I die. Ain’t
that right, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: For Christ’s sake, John! Throw me the
keys!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you say, Jake? Should we trust her?
No? I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Fuck you! Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!
John . . . John!?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here’s to you, Jake. A friend to the end. And
to Grace. What a woman. What a fucking woman.</p>
