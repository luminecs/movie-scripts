<p><strong>close on</strong>: A “Have A Nice Day” HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM
rises past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING. We PULL BACK and find that
the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but
amazingly not far from his physical prime–body chiseled, built like a
truck. Handsome too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his
face. Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian tea
leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: –addressing the United Nations today,
the President expressed his concern over the increasingly intense
territorial disputes in both Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES–</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: The sound of a bullet at one end of the
world echoes across the ocean to the other end. Armed conflict is not
self contained in its respective region–the consequences reverberate
through every nation across the world and therefore must be avoided at
all costs.</p>
<p><strong>cut back to</strong>: The Anchorwoman–</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: While the President’s position was
clear, he did not comment on whether or not he would order Dr. Manhattan
into action should the situation continue to escalate.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN–a man, at
least he appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage
shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads straight
for him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan
stops the missile in its flight–frozen in mid-air–inches from his face.
With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr. Manhattan
disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the smoke clears, we see he’s
still there. Unscathed– –Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the
channel– CRASH!–The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake
jumps up, immediately at the ready– –when we see the INTRUDER’S FEET
entering. Slowly. Blake sees the Intruder’s face, though we never do–we
only see that he’s dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT
HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Just a matter of time, I suppose. With
sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from under his cup,
sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The Intruder BATS IT out of the air
with even quicker reflexes, but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL
with a SILENCER from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He’s a pro . but so
is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot off, the Intruder is
already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out of Blake’s hand– –Blake PUNCHES
the Intruder in the chest plate–the Intruder drops the gun. Blake
fights. Not like an old man, but like the trained killer he is. But the
Intruder is much, much faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with
an elbow to the head. Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder
picks Blake up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great
New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in the eye .
and starts laughing. Hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: I always thought I knew the punchline. But I
guess the joke’s on me now. He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard
Blake a moment– –then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS
HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a sound as
he plummets to the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Blake’s dead body. His eyes are wide open,
not in fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his
head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the sidewalk by
his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood DRIPS on it . when the
pin is WASHED AWAY.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: It’s been over four hours, I got a
business to run– As they argue, we’re back following the happy face pin,
as the water carries it to a DRAIN– –when someone picks the pin up.
We’re in this person’s POV as he studies the pin for a moment before
pocketing it. We never see his face. We move from his POV– –to across
the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at the news stand stare at.
the crime scene. At the cop still arguing with the shopkeeper, the
patrol cars, the yellow tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake’s
BODY BAG. Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse the
magazines and periodicals, most of which have inflammatory headlines
regarding the tense atmosphere currently in the world–a Newsweek
headline reads “War?”, The New York Times: “China Moves Battleships near
Taiwanese Waters,” The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President with
Dr. Manhattan: “What Me Worry?” The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning
at the papers.</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: Depressing ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But good for business, right?</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: Yeah. Irony’s a bitch. The man pays for
a newspaper when A HOMELESS MAN taps the News Vendor on the
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: The current issue of The New
Frontiersman, where is it?</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: It’s late this month.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: When will it be here?</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: I dunno, pal, like I said, it’s late–
We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake’s apartment building, then MOVE
UP the building, to the broken glass window Blake was thrown out of. We
MOVE INTO THE WINDOW–</p>
<p><strong>det. fine</strong>: Edward Blake–63 years old, six-two, 225.
A solid 225, guy was built like a linebacker. This is plate glass too,
you’d have to step on the gas just to put a crack in this. Had to be a
two man job. At least. You check the bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>det. gallagher</strong>: Drawers were open, tossed through.
Mattress flipped.</p>
<p><strong>det. fine</strong>: Robbery?</p>
<p><strong>det. gallagher</strong>: Or made to look like one. Found that
in the bedroom. Det. Fine studies it. It’s Blake’s UNITED NATIONS ID. It
reads “Special Advisor, United States.”</p>
<p><strong>det. gallagher</strong>: You see this? He picks up a PHOTO
from the floor, hands it to Fine.</p>
<p><strong>det. gallagher</strong>: Shaking hands with the
President.</p>
<p><strong>det. fine</strong>: You’re saying this guy was a spook? You
think this might be a political murder?</p>
<p><strong>det. gallagher</strong>: I think that this is way bigger than
the both of us. He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Rorschach’s Journal, October 12th.
Earlier today I came across what appeared to be a suicide. It was later
learned to be a homicide. Someone’s time was up. Still in POV, we see
the person pull something from his pocket–the happy face pin. We realize
that this was the person whose POV we were in earlier.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I discovered a clue. Something I
recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly . I heard my own clock ticking.
We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time– RORSCHACH –a
masked vigilante who wears a trench coat, fedora, and a silver-white
MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS moving about, creating shifting, doubled
PATTERNS like a Rorschach test. Scary looking. Rorschach draws a
hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE
THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches itself through Blake’s broken window.
Pressing RETRACT, Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: You sure it wasn’t the wind?</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Nah, I definitely heard something.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: I tell ya, I’d rather do traffic duty than be
posted at a crime scene all night. Watch the door. Cop 1 pulls his gun,
going through the motions rather than being concerned. He then enters
the bedroom. Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Clear! I’m checking the other rooms. Cop 2
relaxes a bit, turns– –and comes face to “face” with Rorschach, standing
inches away. The Cop’s face goes slack with childish terror. He goes to
yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, “Shhh”– The fingers JAB INTO THE
COP’S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and falls silently as Rorschach brushes
past him like a whisper.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: See, the Comedian thought he had it all
worked out.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A FRAMED PHOTO of the first
Watchmen–identical to the old one in Blake’s closet. Holding the photo
is HOLLIS MASON. He puts the photo down, but we don’t see his face
yet.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: He was young and arrogant, but what he
lacked in experience, he made up for in . tenacity. As he speaks, we PAN
ACROSS various FRAMED MEMORABILIA: The first is a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING
dated 1958: MYSTERIOUS MASKED MAN CLEANS UP WHARFS–the caption
underneath reads “Hero Calls Himself The Nite Owl.”</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Guess I was that way too, when I started.
I’ll never know what possessed me to put that mask on the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: It started with the villains, y’know, people
forget that. Pirate outfits, ghosts. Gangs that thought it was funny to
dress up and pull heists, crap like that.</p>
<p><strong>pan across</strong>: Another FRAMED CLIPPING, dated 1962:
NITE OWL FORMS WATCHMEN–COSTUMED HEROES COMBINING FORCES! “‘We’re going
to clean up this town!’ Says costumed crusader.”</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: So a few cops, we decide it might be funny
to mask up too. Be anonymous. Take these guys on at the street level,
right? Then the media got wind, ran with it, turned it into a whole
different beast.</p>
<p><strong>pan across</strong>: A GOLD STATUE of NITE OWL in his
Sixties-era costume. The plaque below reads: IN GRATITUDE, 1969. Another
clipping: “Hero Retires, Reveals Identity In Tell All Book.” Finally, we
come to HOLLIS MASON , 70s, though his eyes sparkle with strength and
his face still shows the edges of a born hero. The TV is on in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Superheroes, Supervillians–you know who I
ran into the other day at the market? The Screaming Skull. We chatted
for a while. Turns out he’s a born again.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No way. We see who Hollis is speaking to–DAN
DREIBERG , late 30’s, handsome, though he’s let himself go the past few
years–his edges have gone soft. He was in the photo of the new Watchmen
in Blake’s apartment.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: All the nuts that started popping up, I’ll
tell ya. Who was that midget you and your partner chased down years ago?
What’d he call himself?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The Big Figure.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Big Figure. A midget bad guy. Guess it
doesn’t get lower than that, does it? Hollis laughs at his own joke; Dan
chuckles, polite.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Wow, it’s really late. Dan stands, finishes his
beer. Hollis sees him to the door.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Well, even though I spent my time catching
real bad guys, you were still a better Nite Owl than I ever was.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s bullshit, Hollis, and you know it. They
hug.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: With all this talk of war, all that’s going
on in the world, it’s a shame the government forced all you guys out.
Before Dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on the TV:</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: This just in–masked vigilante Rorschach
has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime
scene in the early morning hours. Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most
wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes
ten years ago. Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on
screen.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Well, forced all of you guys out except
one.</p>
<p>****: Next week? Dan nods, then leaves.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Move your leg.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: I said move, dick. Dan finally realizes
what he’s talking about. Dan meets his eyes, for just a moment and draws
back his leg. The Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask
half up, eating a cold CAN</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some
beans. You don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some
up for you?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No need.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rorschach finishes the can of beans,
stands, pulls his mask back down. There’s a strong familiarity between
the two but at the same time, Dan is wary.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You were on the news. They say you attacked a
cop.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Minor wound. Won’t need
hospitalization.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Other than that . How have you been
keeping?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Out of prison. So far. Look at this. He
tosses Blake’s happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it up, runs his
fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: This little stain, is that bean juice or–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Human bean juice. It belonged to the
Comedian. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the
window. DAN Let’s talk downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Murder. Someone threw him out a
window.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not
have known who Blake was.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian?
Ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re right. I heard he was working for the
government. Maybe it was a political killing.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Maybe. Or maybe someone’s decided to kill
off costumed heroes.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You don’t think that’s . a little paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Is that what they’re saying about me now?
That I’m paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I-’m just saying the Comedian made a lot of
enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any. The man
wasn’t exactly endearing. Just because something happened to him doesn’t
mean it involves us.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: One of our own has been murdered. I
thought you might be interested. An attack on one is an attack on all of
us, right? Dan hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m out, Rorschach. I’ve been out, we’ve all
been out. Except you. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I’d
let you know. Just in case.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out to
the warehouse on Fleet street– Rorschach turns to walk off down a long,
dark TUNNEL.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I remember. Used to come here a lot. Back
when we were partners.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach. Great
times. What ever happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You quit. Rorschach disappears into the
SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old
costume hanging.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: So tell me what you wanna do. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>army officer</strong>: Seeing that I don’t have to be back to
base till Friday–everything. He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser.
Then takes his UNIFORM off like he can’t wait. The Hooker gets on top of
him- –when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in, yanks the
Hooker off– –the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which
Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy’s arm, then KICKS the Officer
on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to shreds. The Officer cries
out in pain, falls to the floor– Rorschach nails him in the head with a
BLACK JACK, knocking him out. The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by
the hair and SLAMS her face into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Quiet, whore.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Nose broken and bleeding, the Hooker
quiets to a whimper. Rorschach takes the officer’s uniform and ID. Then
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m here to see Adrian Veidt.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Do you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to
see him.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Veidt doesn’t see anyone
without an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I understand, but if you would just tell Adrian
that Dan Dreiberg is here, I’m an old friend.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Well, Mr. Veidt is very busy at the</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Just tell him I’m here. I assure you he’ll see
me. Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken. She
reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office. Once she’s gone, Dan’s
glare disappears, replaced by nervousness. Because he’s not sure if
Adrian will see him– it’s been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY
GUARDS eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Go on in, Mr. Dreiberg.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you
are considered the world’s smartest man?</p>
<p>****: I think it’s better to be the world’s most modest man. You
should ignore my PR people, they tend to be a little too enthusiastic.
Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly seems out of
breath as he answers questions.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: If we could move off the subject of
business for a moment, I’m curious whether the world’s smartest man
thinks we’re headed for our next World War. Adrian stops the treadmill,
towels off as he heads to Dan.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Predicting stock prices isn’t the same as
predicting world events. I hope there isn’t a war, or even a skirmish
for that matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans,
plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better
place. My team of engineers and scientists have been working with
Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which
will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic
emissions. This energy could power cars, aircrafts, stadiums–there are
no limitations–</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: –but I talk too much. Will you mind pausing
the interview a moment, Doug? A good friend of mine is here. Doug Roth
leaves. Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You look good, Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Dan–it’s been far too long.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: He did? Must’ve been tough to get past your
security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me
out.</p>
<p>****: Sara can be tough. Is that why you came to see me? You’re
worried about this mask killer theory Rorschach’s conjured up?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re the world’s smartest man, Adrian. You
tell me.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Rorschach’s a sociopath suffering through
nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act
was passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done
already. Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors. Something
about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian border. Adrian turns up
the volume, looking grim.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: No, there are other things in the world I’m
far more concerned about.</p>
<p><strong>on the wall</strong>: The TV projector shows an image of TWO
PAKISTANI SOLDIERS on patrol.</p>
<p><strong>pakistani soldier</strong>: We should attack the Indian
bastards. I don’t understand–</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: POV–a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the
Pakistani soldier.</p>
<p><strong>indian soldier #1</strong>: –why I can’t just pull this
trigger. We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with
his sniper rifle aimed.</p>
<p><strong>indian soldier #2</strong>: Because then a battle begins.
Then a war. And then the Americans will send–</p>
<p><strong>chinese captain</strong>: –their blue abomination to
intervene. And we don’t want that. At the same time, we can’t assume to
know what’s on the minds of our enemies. We’re in Chinese waters, off
the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE CAPTAIN and his First Mate look out at
the water. TAIWANESE GUNBOATS can be seen in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Is Dr. Manhattan even real?</p>
<p><strong>israeli officer</strong>: Why don’t you ask the Vietnamese.
Or the Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god for that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Good evening, Rorschach. –and we see
DR. MANHATTAN for the very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT
ripples from his skin, emanating pure power–he is God on earth. He works
on a reactor–telekinetically moving parts in the air– not even looking
at Rorschach. It’s as if Dr. Manhattan already knew he was coming.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues
about his business when his girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in
her prime, enters from the other end.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Jon, did you say some–Rorschach: What are
you doing here? You’re a wanted man.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Don’t call me that. My mother made me take
that name. I always hated it.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should
tell you the bad news–the Comedian has been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Yes, since he and I are the only two
extranormal operatives currently employed by the government, I was
informed. The CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic groups.
Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He speaks in a
cold, even, matter of fact manner.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I have my own theories. But neither of
you seem too concerned.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: A live human body and a dead human
body have the same number of particles. Structurally there’s no
difference.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Well, I might not be able to count
molecules, but either way, Blake was a bastard. You know he tried to
rape my mother?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Sounds like you may have had a score to
settle. You or your mother.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What? Are you accusing–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Rorschach, please don’t upset Laurie.
I</p>
<p><strong>don’t–</strong>: He pauses as if he hears something.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Excuse me for a moment. Suddenly he
disappears.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: –when suddenly Dr. Manhattan
materializes in a blue flash, floating in mid-air. The Middle Eastern
Men shield their eyes from the light, then realize in awe and fear</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: It’s him He’s, he’s real. Allah
help us, he’s real! The men run for it but it’s useless–Dr. Manhattan
shoots BEAMS OF ENERGY at them, freezing all the men in mid motion–
–when PORT SECURITY pulls up. They get out of their jeeps, in awe of
Dr. Manhattan, still floating in mid-air.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: These men were transporting a
shipment of enriched uranium– With a gesture, the container floats off
the truck and separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside.
Suddenly the uranium changes–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I’ve safely transformed the uranium
into sand. I trust you can take things from here. And just like that he
disappears–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: –I’m not here to judge the moral
discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You call rape a moral discrepancy?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Rorschach–you’re upsetting Laurie. I
think you ought to go.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I came here to warn you both, just like I
warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone may be targeting masked
heroes–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I said you ought to go.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: It took a lot of effort to get in here.
I’m not leaving before I’ve– With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: –had my say Rorschach realizes what just
happened. Checks himself, his surroundings. Reorients himself. With
nothing else he can do, he heads down the road.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: He’s gone. Are you okay now?</p>
<p><strong>yeah</strong>: Are you okay, Jon? Dr. Manhattan pauses for a
moment, thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I’m having trouble with my vision. I
can’t see clearly what lies ahead. There’s some static interference.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Interference? Caused by what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I’m uncertain. A power surge of great
magnitude? Perhaps a nuclear detonation.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: More war talk. I can’t deal with this. I
don’t want to think about the future right now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: There’s no such thing as the
“future.” I’ve explained to you on many occasions–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: –that time is simultaneous. There’s no past
to travel back to, no future to travel forward to, everything happens
all at once, our actions affect the course of time instantly, yes I
know.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, it’s just a little unnerving to be with someone who
can see the future, or whatever you call it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I understand your frustration,
Laurie. The human mind for some reason is only capable of viewing time
frame by frame. Perhaps you’d find it more comforting if you could
perceive time as I do Dr. Manhattan touches her head–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Jon, stop!</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I didn’t mean to upset you.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I know. I think I’ve been cooped up on this
base for too long. Rorschach mentioned Dan Dreiberg–we haven’t seen him
in years. Maybe we can give him a call, see if he’s available for dinner
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: You go ahead, Laurie. I want to
further investigate this interference with my vision. I find it
troubling.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: Going somewhere, Miss Jupiter?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: I’ll have a car brought around in a
few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No, thank you. I called a cab already– it’s
waiting for me outside. She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in
front of her.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: You look quite nice. Who are you
meeting?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: An old friend of mine. And of
Dr. Manhattan’s. Now step out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: Please keep in mind, Ms. Jupiter, that
your boyfriend is this country’s most valuable asset. You need to keep
him happy. And on our side. Laurie glares at him.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yes, sir. She brushes past him as she
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You remember that crazy guy, what did he
call himself . Captain Carnage! Pretended to be a supervillian just so
he could get beat up all the time?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just walked
away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight
yelling, “punish me! punish me!”</p>
<p>****: Whatever happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and
Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. They look at each other,
serious, then explode in laughter.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Sorry, sorry, that’s not funny. I can’t
remember the last time I laughed like this. It feels good. Dan looks at
her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he’s smitten with her and
that he probably has been for years. Laurie seems oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s great seeing you again, Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yeah, this was fun. The WAITER arrives with
the check; Laurie grabs it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You sure I can’t get that?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Let me put my expense account to use. You
can thank Uncle Sam.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Laurie nods out the window. Dan turns
and sees a GOVERNMENT SEDAN parked outside.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: They’ve been watching the whole time?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Just making sure I’m not doing anything that
might upset the country’s most powerful weapon.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How is Jon, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I really don’t know. It’s been harder and
harder to tell over the years. It’s like his emotions are slowly
eroding. To be honest, I can’t tell if he even cares about me anymore.
They’re quiet a moment. Laurie glances at her watch.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I should get back.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do
it? Why did we dress up like that? I think the Keene Act was the best
thing to ever happen to us.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I mean, you remember my costume? All that
tight spandex? That was awful.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Uh, yeah. Awful.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: And to think my own mother pushed me into
that spandex. Pushed me into the whole costume thing in the first place.
Wanted her little girl to be just like mommy and fight bad guys.</p>
<p>****: Well, I guess my ride is here. She gives Dan a hug.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: We’ll do this again.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah. I’d really like that. Laurie crosses the
street and gets into the sedan. As Dan watches the car drive off, TWO
KIDS nearly bump into him, running around playing. The Kids make flying
noises.</p>
<p><strong>kid 1</strong>: I’m Dr. Manhattan, saving the Twin
Towers!</p>
<p><strong>kid 2</strong>: No, I wanna be Dr. Manhattan!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You can take turns, okay? Dan watches the
Kids for a moment, then walks away. The Twin Towers looming behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Laurie? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’d figure you’d be used to traveling that
way by now.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Well, I’m not. I hate it when Jon teleports
me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Margarita?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No. Sally pours herself a margarita from a
pitcher on the counter. We see photos, remnants of Sally from her
crimefighting days around the condo. Under the pitcher of margaritas is
a days old LA Times with the headline: “Dr. Manhattan Intercepts
Terrorists At Port.”</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s Eddie Blake’s funeral today, isn’t it?
Laurie nods.</p>
<p><strong>funeral</strong>: Blake’s coffin is removed from the
hearse.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Finally got his punchline, I guess. Poor
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After what
he–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Laurie, you’re still young. You don’t
understand how things change as time goes by.</p>
<p><strong>funeral</strong>: Blake’s coffin is carried past Adrian, Dan
and Dr. Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Another lesson on time passing. Y’know, you
and Jon should get together and write a book on the subject. Sally
reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of the Watchmen, the
same one with Blake and Hollis Mason in it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That leaves just two of the old team left. Me
and Hollis Mason. She stops at Blake in the photo, regarding him.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Eddie was the Comedian. He always thought
he’d get the last laugh. As the PRIEST speaks, we move down the row of
mourners, stopping at Dr. Manhattan looking thoughtfully into
Blake’s</p>
<p><strong>match cut to</strong>: Dr. Manhattan. In the night sky, a
BURST of FIREWORKS. Outside, a CROWD of Vietnamese people CHEER.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Fireworks. A young Blake sits in a derelict
Saigon bar, mean drunk. His face is devoid of his trademark scar.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: You’d think this country’d had enough goddamn
fireworks. If we’d’ve lost this war, I think it might have driven us
crazy, y’know? As a country. But we didn’t. Thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: You sound bitter.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Me? I think it’s hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>vietnamese girl</strong>: Mr. Eddie? They both turn. A pretty
VIETNAMESE GIRL stands in the door. She’s pregnant, just starting to
show.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Fantastic. Just what I need.</p>
<p><strong>vietnamese girl</strong>: The war is over now. We must talk.
About this.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blake SLAMS his glass down. He glares at
her, drunk and dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: There’s nothing to talk about cuz I’m
leaving. I’m gonna forget you and your horrible, sweaty little country.
He turns away. Her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred.</p>
<p><strong>vietnamese girl</strong>: No. You will remember. You will
remember me and my country forever. She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns
just as the broken SHARDS SLASH HIS FACE, slicing him his jagged
scar</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: You bitch! My face! He PUSHES HER into the
bar and DRAWS HIS PISTOL–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Blake . don’t. BLAM! Blake shoots
her; the Girl SLAMS against the far wall. She drops, dead.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned
her down. Blake turns on him, spitting fury.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: That’s right! And you know what? You watched
me! You could’ve changed the gun into steam or the bullets into mercury
or the bottle into snowflakes, but you didn’t, did you? You’re drifting
outta touch, Doc–I’ve seen it. Don’t tell me the war got to you. Blake
walks off shouting “Medic!” Dr. Manhattan turns to the girl’s body and
regards it, curious. MATCH CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: This is all bullshit. Dan, fit and trim in
full Nite Owl regalia, attends the meeting of the “new” Watchmen.
Rorschach is there, as is a teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex
costume. Dr. Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend
JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young Laurie . who
definitely glances back. Dan also pays Laurie attention, but she is
oblivious. A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: What are you saying, Comedian? Blake, now in
his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table, a FLASK in hand. The
PAPER in his hand reads: “Arab Leaders Call Dr. Manhattan: ‘America’s
Weapon of Satan.”’</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: What I’m saying is this whole bringing back
the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It didn’t work twenty years ago, and it
ain’t gonna work just because you want to keep on playing Cowboys and
Indians.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Maybe we should agree on no drinking at
meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang
problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach’s voice is quiet, not yet its
tortured rasp.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: That’s true. But something like this
seems too big. Too bureaucratic.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Bureaucracies can be effective with the
right leadership–</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: And that would be you, right Veidt? I mean
you’re the “smartest guy in the world,” right?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: It doesn’t take a genius to see that the
world has problems.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: But it takes a roomful of morons to think
they’re small enough for you guys to handle. You people are a joke. You
hear Moloch’s back in town and get your panties in a bunch. You think
that matters?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Of course it does. Justice matters.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Justice. Hilarious. There’s no such thing as
justice. He stands, moving to Adrian’s DISPLAY which outlines the
Watchmen’s agenda: GANGS, RACKETEERING, DRUGS. Blake flicks his ZIPPO
and the display GOES UP IN FLAMES.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: My display .</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Justice doesn’t matter, alright? Because
twenty years from now we’re all gonna be dust. Mankind’s been trying to
kill each other off since the beginning of time and now we finally got
the power to finish the job. Ain’t nothin’ gonna matter when the nukes
start flying, and I promise you they will. Then Ozymandias here is gonna
be the smartest man on the cinder. He sneers and walks out. Silence.
Uncomfortable in the wake of truth, the others pack up to go, muttering
apologies to Adrian, but Adrian ignores them, staring at the flames
flickering across his face. He seems more thoughtful than upset. MATCH
CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>pan up to reveal</strong>: The streets JAMMED with ANGRY
PROTESTORS, waving signs decrying vigilantes.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: AN OVAL AIRSHIP–the OWL SHIP–its forward
windows sculpted like the eyes of a great owl.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dan, in costume, pilots the ship. The
Comedian stands outside the ship, in one of the “owl eyes,” wielding a
MACHINE GUN.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Crawl back in yer holes before you get hurt!
I got rubber bullets!</p>
<p><strong>man in crowd</strong>: We want regular cops! No more
vigilantes!</p>
<p><strong>woman in crowd</strong>: My son is a cop, asshole! The
Comedian gets HIT IN THE HEAD by a flying SODA CAN.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Okay, that’s how you wanna do it?! Smiling
grimly, he FIRES TEAR GAS CANNISTERS INTO THE CROWD.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>choice. please clear the streets!</strong>: The Comedian
DIVES into the crowd, knocking random people aside with his rifle butt,
then starts firing rubber bullets into the crowd. The protestors scatter
and retreat. Dan lands the Owl Ship, exits wearing a GAS MASK, hands one
to Blake.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Comedian, this is a nightmare! The whole city
is erupting!</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Hah! You seen this? The smoke clears enough
for Dan to see a message SPRAY- PAINTED on a brick wall: “WHO WATCHES
THE WATCHMEN?”</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How long can we keep this up?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: My government contacts tell me they’re
pushing some new bill through Congress.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Until then, we’re society’s only
protection.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Protection from what? Blake laughs, exultant in
the blowing smoke, the chaos.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Are you kidding? From themselves.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: the happy face pin on Blake’s costume.
MATCH CUT TO-</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Lord have mercy upon us. Amen. Dan DROPS the
pin into Blake’s grave. The mourners linger a moment as dirt is shoveled
onto Blake’s casket, then start filing out. We follow one particular
mourner all the way in the back–a LONE MAN, as he walks away.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar
William Vaughn. Also known as William Edgar Bright. Also known as
Moloch.</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: What are you talking about? I’m a retired
business maaAAAHHH!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rorschach TWISTS the man’s arm back
viciously.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Lie again, I’ll break your arm.</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: Oh God, please. I did my time. I’m not
Moloch anymore. What do you want from me? Rorschach lets him go.
Moloch’s hollow eyes follow him.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You attended a funeral today. Why?</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: The funeral? I don’t know why I went. I just
felt I should. I’d been thinking about the Comedian– Rorschach SLAMS
Moloch against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: How did you know Blake was the
Comedian?</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had his
mask off. He was drunk–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You were enemies for forty years. Why
would he visit you?</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: I don’t know! I woke up in my bedroom and
there he was! He was upset! Crying!</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: The Comedian? Crying?</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: He, he was babbling, not making sense. I was
pissing in my pants–I thought he was going to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: What did he say?!</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: He said he was wrong. About it all being a
joke, that it wasn’t funny anymore. He said he was scared–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Scared of what?!</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: Something he saw, I think. He said something
about wishing he never broke into that building. But that he had to keep
his mouth shut. Then, then he left! Rorschach studies Moloch a moment,
then releases him.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable.
Probably true. Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some
drawers, looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through it.
One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from “Pyramid
Industries.”</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: So that’s it? I’m clean?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Clean? I searched your house. Found
illegal drugs.</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: Illegal–I don’t use drugs. Rorschach pulls a
PILL BOTTLE from his coat.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Laetril. Phony medication made from
apricot pits. Illegal.</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: oh c-come on. Look, please don’t confiscate
that. I’m trying anything . I have cancer.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: What kind of cancer?</p>
<p><strong>moloch</strong>: The kind you don’t get better from.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Fine. You’re off the hook, for now. If
you remember anything else, leave me a note in the trash can opposite
the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out of trouble,
Moloch.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Rorschach blasting through the night air
as the city streams by. This close, he appears to be flying.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Rorschach’s Journal, October 17th.
Thought about Moloch’s story on my way to the cemetery. Could all be
lies. A scheme for revenge planned during his years behind bars.</p>
<p><strong>cut wide</strong>: To reveal he is actually PERCHED ATOP AN
ELEVATED SUBWAY CAR. Just one way he gets around.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: But if it’s true, then what? What could
have possibly scared the Comedian? What building was he talking about?
What was it that he saw? So many questions.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Edward Blake–the Comedian. Born 1944,
buried in the rain. Murdered.</p>
<p><strong>flash to</strong>: Blake, the night of his murder, turning as
his door is kicked in.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Violent lives ending violently.</p>
<p><strong>flash to</strong>: Adrian’s display burning.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Blake understood. Humans are violent in
nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it.</p>
<p><strong>flashes of</strong>: The group photo of the old Watchmen.
Then the photo of the new Watchmen.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Blake saw the true face of human kind and
chose to become a parody of it, treated it like a joke.</p>
<p><strong>flashes of</strong>: Blake being beaten in his apartment.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I heard a joke once. Man goes to a
doctor, says he’s depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Blake is KICKED
in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Says he feels all alone in a threatening
world. Blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Doctor says, “the treatment is simple.
The great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That
should pick you up.” Blake is lifted up by the Intruder’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: The man bursts into tears. A bloodied
Blake laughs at the Intruder.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: “But doctor,” he says. ULTRA-SLOW, Blake
crashes through his apartment window.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: “I am Pagliacci.” Blake FLIES TOWARD
FRAME on his silent trip to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Good joke. Everybody laugh. Blake FALLS
INTO FRAME–GO BLACK .</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Laurie, eyes closed with pleasure, as
Dr. Manhattan’s GLOWING BLUE HANDS caress her face.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Mmm. What time do you have to be at your TV
interview?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Don’t worry, we have plenty of
time.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Eyes still closed, she does not see a
THIRD BLUE HAND trace a line down her cheek. She kisses it.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hey, your finger, it’s like licking a
battery. It’s all– She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as
she sees TWO DR. MANHATTANS in bed with her.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh God! That’s horrible! Stop it! Laurie
jumps up. The two Dr. Manhattans stand, confused.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan 1 dr. manhattan 2</strong>: Please don’t be
upset. I thought you’d enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m sorry, I–You startled me, that’s all</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan 1</strong>: I don’t know what stimulates you
anymore. Laurie backs into the hall, trying to get a grip.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Forget about it. I overreacted. It was just
strange to see– Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD
DR. MANHATTAN is working on an experiment. Her eyes blaze.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: How long have you been working in here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan 1</strong>: Laurie, try to understand–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Understand!? You’re working in here at the
same time we’re in bed!?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan 3</strong>: My work with Adrian is at an
important stage. It seemed unnecessary to–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Shut up! Just SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Laurie WHIPS
a full BEAKER at 3’s chest. It PASSES THROUGH HIM and SMASHES IN THE
KITCHEN SINK. Laurie storms out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan 3</strong>: Laurie, please–If you think there’s
a problem with my attitude, I’m prepared to discuss it– As he speaks,
the smashed BEAKER and its contents RISE INTO THE AIR, REASSEMBLING
perfectly in the palm of 3’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>in the hall</strong>: Laurie nearly bumps into Dr. Manhattan
2.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan 2</strong>: –but logically, not clouded with
human emotion.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Human emotion? You were human once. That’s
the problem, Jon. You’ve forgotten that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan 2</strong>: Laurie, where are you– The door
slams. Laurie’s left. For good. Dr. Manhattan 2 stands there. He walks
back to the BEDROOM where 1 is. Dr. Manhattan 1 holds an OLD PHOTO. In
the photo is a COUPLE, smiling into the camera. We recognize the woman
as Janey Slater, Dr. Manhattan’s ex-girlfriend, who we saw in Adrian’s
flashback at Blake’s funeral. We recognize the man in the photo as .
Dr. Manhattan. When he was human. Dr. Manhattan stares at the photo.
Perhaps feeling the tingle of human emotion again</p>
<p><strong>news analyst</strong>: –no one’s fired their weapons yet, but
no one’s lowered them either. Maybe these other countries aren’t so
afraid of Dr. Manhattan, maybe they’re calling the President’s bluff.
I’m very curious to see what Dr. Manhattan himself has to say in his
live interview which should be in about an hour or so BOOM, BOOM! Dan
looks up. Someone’s banging on the door. Hard.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It’s Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Laurie? It takes a few moments for him to open
the door.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it’s a
little sticky–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I left Jon.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you
here?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I lost them in the subways. I think.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m really sorry, Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Living with him . Dan, you don’t know what
it’s been like.</p>
<p><strong>intercut to</strong>: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie’s BRA.
Staring.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: The way he looks at things, like he can’t
remember what they are, like he doesn’t really care. This world, the
real world to him it’s like walking through mist, and all the people are
just shadows. Shadows in the fog. Dr. Manhattan lowers his head. A
SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. He looks up to see a THREE PIECE SUIT floating
before him– waiting for its wearer.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I hope I didn’t ruin your night.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Not at all. I was just going to see Hollis for
our weekly beer session. You’re more than welcome to join. In fact, I
insist They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless Man
is arguing with the News Vendor:</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: –I told you, this month’s issue still
hasn’t arrived yet! Why do you care about that right wing rag so much?
Cuz those bastards don’t give a damn about you, pal! They–hold up, here
it comes. They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a
BUNDLE of the latest issue of “The New Frontiersman.”</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Dr. Manhattan stepping THROUGH and INTO the
empty, floating suit. His TIE knots itself. Dr. Manhattan looks around
the empty room . sad? Again, he looks at the photo of him and Janey
Slater . . then</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Laurie, will you please stop apologizing? I’m
here for you anytime. SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone’s
following.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I know. I just find it rude when people show
up at your door–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: –completely out of the blue. Suddenly,
Dr. Manhattan appears in a burst of energy. The receptionist SHRIEKS.
The PRODUCER looks out his office.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one
thinks to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: He, he just–</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: All geez. We don’t have time for make-up.
That blue is too light for television. The light from Dr. Manhattan’s
SKIN DARKENS to a DEEPER BLUE.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Is this dark enough?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Uh, yeah</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: that’s dark enough.</p>
<p><strong>press agent</strong>: Just another reminder that if the
second Geneva Convention comes up, our official position is that talks
will not resume until the Chinese agree to exclude you from the agenda.
The President approved this interview because he wanted to strengthen
morale at home and to gently remind the rest of the world who holds the
cards. Please keep that in mind. Dr. Manhattan stands off stage,
waiting. The LIGHTS come up and we’re live with the glossy NEWS
HOST.</p>
<p><strong>news host</strong>: He’s been called many things; Hero,
weapon, linchpin of our security–</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Dan and Laurie turning as the Young Thugs
BLOCK THE ALLEYWAY. One of the Thugs pulls a KNIFE. Laurie and Dan
exchange a look. Dan removes his glasses. CUT BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>news host</strong>: His given name is Jonathan
Osterman–Dr. Jonathan Osterman–a renowned nuclear physicist who through
a terrible accident became the man the world knows today as
Dr. Manhattan. The audience APPLAUDS loudly as Dr. Manhattan takes his
seat.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>news host</strong>: Thank you, Dr. Manhattan, and not simply
for appearing on this program. I believe I speak for all of America when
I thank you for thwarting the terrorist plot at the port of Long Beach
over a week ago– Furious applause from the audience, which Dr. Manhattan
regards curiously.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: It was my duty.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Dan and Laurie surrounded by the Thugs .
when suddenly they DIVE INTO the group, fighting like the heroes they
once were. Dan grapples with one of the Thugs and knocks his knife away–
–when another Thug nails him from behind with a BAT. Dan drops to the
ground . BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>news host</strong>: Before we start, I want to explain to our
viewers the unconventional format for this interview. Our live audience
is made up entirely of news media and Dr. Manhattan will be taking
questions from the floor. This commercial free broadcast is presented to
you by Veidt Enterprises. We see Adrian standing near the audience with
the Press Agent, smiling for the camera.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CUT TO: Laurie, driving a FIST into a
Thug’s NOSE, when another Thug GRABS HER HAIR.</p>
<p><strong>news host</strong>: We will now take our first question– The
Thug draws a PISTOL on her. Dan, still on the ground, sees the gun and
his eyes narrow, harden. He pushes himself up off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>cut back to</strong>: The TV Studio AUDIENCE: where Doug
Roth, the journalist who interviewed Adrian earlier, stands.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: Dr. Manhattan, Doug Roth, Nova Times. Do
you remember a man named Wally Weaver?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Yes, he was a good friend of mine.
When we were both physicists.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: He died of cancer.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I remember. I attended his
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: How about Edgar Jacobi, also known as the
supervillian Moloch? You had a lot of battles with him, didn’t you? Did
you know that he has cancer as-well? The News Host looks confused.
Adrian turns to the Press Agent, growing concerned with where this is
leading.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Dan, snapping the GUNMAN’S wrist back and
up– Barrel aimed at the Thug’s CHIN. In the last fraction of a second,
Dan SHIFTS the gun two inches left as it FIRES, deafening the Thug, but
leaving him alive. BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I was not aware–</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: And what about Jose Flores? He was the
longtime janitor at the Watchmen Headquarters where you worked for many
years. Cancer.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: By your line of questioning, you’re
suggesting that I was the cause of cancer in these individuals.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: You tell me, doc. Adrian turns to
him.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Doug, that `s enough.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: It is irrelevant whether I was the
cause or not.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: Irrelevant?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: A live human body and a dead human
body have the same number of particles. Structurally there’s no
difference. An appalled then angry buzz comes over the audience.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: What about Janey Slater? Do you think it
makes a difference to her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Janey Slater? Wh–</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: Your ex-girlfriend, she was a physicist
too. You were with her for ten years. Or does she have to remind you
herself? Suddenly Janey Slater emerges from a door at the top of the
stands. She is old now, frail, barely recognizable from the images we’ve
see of her.</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: She has cancer as well. Doctors have
given her six months. What do you have to say, Ms. Slater? He sticks the
microphone in her face.</p>
<p><strong>janey slater</strong>: D-damn you, Jon. God damn you</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She leaves as fast as she came, bursting
into tears. Dr. Manhattan stands, visibly shaken–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: No, Janey, wait! In the audience,
Adrian turns to the Press Agent, frantic.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: We need to stop this now. Adrian and the
Press Agent hurry on stage, SECURITY following.</p>
<p><strong>press agent</strong>: That’s it! Interview’s over!</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: The alley, littered with the unconscious
BODIES of the Thugs. Laurie and Dan lean back on the wall, gasping for
air, horribly out of shape, but victorious.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The TV studio, as Adrian and Security
surround Dr. Manhattan, trying to escort him out. The audience spills
out of the stands, RUSHING Dr. Manhattan with questions and, FLASHING
cameras–it’s madness. Adrian shoves a camera out of Dr. Manhattan’s
face.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: As the sponsor of this program I demand all
cameras off! His plea is futile, of course. A REPORTER breaks through,
gets in Dr. Manhattan’s face.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: Did you give Ms. Slater cancer by
sleeping with her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: No. Please let me through</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: Do you even care about human life?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Please. If everyone would just go
away and leave me alone. Adrian hears the note of warning in his
voice.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Everyone back off! Don’t you understand?
He’s the only thing preventing the world from chaos!</p>
<p><strong>doug roth</strong>: How many other people did you do this to?
Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I said LEAVE ME ALONE! Every last
person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr. Manhattan is suddenly
alone. He looks stunned almost.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us
getting mugged.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Why don’t you come by Hollis’ with me? Shake
off the adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No thanks, I’ve had enough hero stuff for
one night. You take care, Dan. It’s a dangerous world out there.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I know, you won’t believe it–</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: You missed it–Dr. Manhattan just lost it on
live TV.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Wait, what? Dan turns to the TV, which replays
the clip of Dr. Manhattan being accosted and then teleporting everyone
to the roof.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I was just with Laurie. She doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: She’ll know soon enough. The whole world
will know.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Laurel? Laurel Jane? Startled, Laurie turns.
Blake steps out of the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: You’re Sally Jupiter’s kid.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’re the Comedian, right? You were pretty
cool in there. Blake lights a smoke, looks her over.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: You got your mom’s eyes. Even that funny
little mole.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Got another smoke?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: She was one of the all-time champion
beauties, your mom. She talk about me much?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No. Not really. As Blake gives her a light,
Laurie touches his hand to cover the lighter from the wind. She looks up
at him, sly.</p>
<p><strong>take your hands off her.</strong>: Laurie nearly jumps out of
her skin. A younger Sally marches toward them from a LIMO, waiting at
the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Hey Doll. Long time no see.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Not long enough in my book, Eddie. She eyes
Laurie with cool death.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Put that out. Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>inside the limo</strong>: Laurie cracks her window an inch.
Her mother’s harsh, low tone drifts clearly back.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are there no depths you won’t sink to?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Christ, we were just talking! Can’t a guy
talk to his, y’know, friend’s daughter? What the hell do you think I
am?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I know what you are, Eddie. I’ve always
known. Don’t ever forget that. Driving off, Laurie watches Blake through
the window–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Cabbie honks his horn as a team of
SECRET SERVICE AGENTS get out of the SUV. Agent Forbes knocks on
Laurie’s window.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: Ms. Jupiter, you need to come with us
now.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I don’t understand, what do you mean, Jon’s
gone?</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: I mean he snapped and disappeared
during the interview. Now our trackers can’t detect him anywhere on the
planet. If we want to find him you’re our only hope. A TECHNICIAN wires
Laurie up; GRAPHS record Laurie’s neural responses, MONITORS show
satellite images.</p>
<p><strong>technician 1</strong>: Miss Jupiter, we need you to visualize
Dr. Manhattan. Do you need a prompt?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>technician 2</strong>: Neurotransmissions tracking.</p>
<p><strong>technician 3</strong>: Transmitting on all frequencies.</p>
<p><strong>technician 1</strong>: We’re ready Miss Jupiter. We need you
to try and talk to him. Laurie, wired like a porcupine, seems
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Jon? Jon, can you hear me? The GRAPH-NEEDLES
jump and tick, searching . when a high, clear TONE rings through the
room. Needles fly. Technicians dash to lock it down. Agent Forbes
hurries to the graph, looking over their shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: Have you got him?</p>
<p><strong>technician 1</strong>: We’ve located his signal, yes.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: Well? Where the hell is he? The
Technician looks up, not happy about the answer.</p>
<p><strong>technician 1</strong>: He’s on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter 1</strong>: –massive mobilization of troops
in</p>
<p><strong>news reporter 2</strong>: –unconfirmed reports of a gunfire
exchange in Tehran–</p>
<p><strong>news reporter 3</strong>: –prompting the President to call an
emergency meeting with his National Security Advisors–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Jon. Can you hear me, Jon? But these VOICES
get progressively QUIETER, as we–</p>
<p><strong>zoom back</strong>: Up, out of the atmosphere, at a blinding
rate–</p>
<p><strong>janey slater</strong>: Aww, Jon, look–you’ve got cotton candy
on the side of your mouth</p>
<p><strong>jon osterman</strong>: You do too. Here, let me get it for
you. He pulls her close. They giggle like the young lovers they are and
then kiss, passionate</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: Dr. Manhattan walking on mars’ surface. He
approaches a LARGE ROCK FORMATION which blocks his path. He PARTS the
rock formation telekinetically, like Moses parting the sea– –and we
FLASHBACK, mirroring the parting of the rock formation to the parting of
two SLIDING DOORS, in the LAB OF A NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITY, as Jon
steps into the REACTOR</p>
<p>****: I’ll catch up with you guys–I left my watch inside . Jon backs
into the chamber without noticing the DIGITAL CLOCK above the doors
counting down: 3 2 1–“TIME LOCK INITIATED”–the doors CLOSE .</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: Dr. Manhattan on Mars as he stops to pick
up a STRANGE ROCK. It’s beautiful–the colors, the crystals– unlike
anything we’ve ever seen– –and we FLASHBACK to Jon’s lab COLLEAGUES
watching in horror as Jon retrieves his WATCH, oblivious. They try to
open the door, but it’s no use–the time lock can’t be overridden. Janey
arrives, SCREAMS when she sees Jon inside. Jon turns, sees all the
terrified faces staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>jon osterman</strong>: Janey? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>janey slater</strong>: The time lock, Jon! As it dawns on
Jon, he hears the hum of the REACTOR INITIATING, the big mechanical
parts moving. Jon runs to the door, BANGS on it.</p>
<p><strong>jon osterman</strong>: Janey: Oh my god! TEARS stream down
Janey’s face as she looks at him through the thick glass, helpless,
hopeless. Inside, the chamber starts to GLOW .</p>
<p><strong>janey slater</strong>: I’m sorry, Jon, I can’t– Janey can’t
bear to watch–she runs out of the lab as the reactor initiates</p>
<p><strong>janey!</strong>: . and with a BLINDING FLASH–Jon and his
watch are OBLITERATED to bits .</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he obliterates
the strange rock he was holding to bits and we FLASHBACK to the lab
CAFETERIA. Janey sits at a table, crying softly, being consoled by her
colleagues</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: OUTSIDE THE NUCLEAR FACILITY, by the barbed
wire fences, A DISEMBODIED BRAIN, A SET OF EYES, AND A SPINAL</p>
<p><strong>column materializes .</strong>: BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on
Mars, as he RISES into the air. At a thought, the RED SAND FUSES into a
beautiful, PINK GLASS</p>
<p><strong>structure–</strong>: –and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria
KITCHEN as a COOK SHRIEKS at A WALKING NETWORK OF HUMAN VEINS–</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: The pink glass structure on Mars which
SPREADS OUT INTO COMPLEX GLASS PATTERNS, RISING FROM THE PLAIN at
Dr. Manhattan’s command– –and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria HALLWAY as a
SKELETON passes two terrified GUARDS</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: Dr. Manhattan, now dwarfed by the RISING,
EVOLVING GLASS STRUCTURE, which begins to resemble parts of a WATCH–
–and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria. Janey’s still crying. One of her
Colleagues reaches for her hand when STATIC SPARKS snap around them. All
over the cafeteria, the METAL UTENSILS begin to SPARK. In the center of
the room, GLOWING BLUE PARTICLES begin to collect, SLAMMING INTO EACH
OTHER with amazing force and in a BLINDING FLASH, THE PARTICLES FORM DR.
MANHATTAN, hovering over the room like a newborn god. Everyone in the
cafeteria looks up in awe, in fear and–</p>
<p><strong>janey slater</strong>: Oh god . Jon is that you?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: –recognition.</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: Mars, where Dr. Manhattan’s GLASS PALACE
rises in its full glory. A home fit for a god.</p>
<p><strong>pull out from</strong>: A SATELLITE IMAGE of MARS. NOISE
filters back in, as TECHNICIANS buzz this way and that, desperate.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: There must be some way to contact him.
Laurie sits in the room, largely forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Agent Forbes.</p>
<p><strong>agent forbes</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I need to go to the bathroom. Agent Forbes
gives her a look, then waves for a SECRET SERVICE AGENT to escort
her.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’re getting me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: We’re only detaining you for
national security purposes. Don’t you understand?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Don’t you understand that sitting there with
a bunch of high tech radios and monitors isn’t going to bring him
back?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Only one thing can bring ion back and that’s
Jon. If he wants to find me, he’s quite capable of doing so on his own.
I’ve been a prisoner in my live long enough. You are taking me out of
here because if you don’t, and Jon does come back, I’m going to let him
know who was naughty and who was nice. And he won’t give you a lump of
coal–he’ll turn you into one, understand? The Agent eyes her, then
reluctantly gets to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Jesus! Rorschach</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Good morning, Daniel. I brought in your
paper. Dan reads the headline: “DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH.”</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: The Comedian murdered. Dr. Manhattan
exiled. Two of us gone within a week. Who’s next? Veidt? Ms. Jupiter?
Me? You? Rorschach turns for the door as Dan reads the story.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: By the way, that new lock broke after one
shove.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: My new lock?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Get a stronger one, Daniel. You can’t be
too security conscious these days.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: These days nobody’s safe. We see the same
Pakistani Soldiers from before, only now there are dozens more TROOPS
with them, mobilizing on the border as are their Indian
counterparts–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CUT TO: The Chinese Battleships we saw
before, moving towards the coast of Taiwan. They FIRE SHOTS–</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The Israel Missile Control room we were in
before now bustles with frantic action.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: –three synagogues were bombed in Tel Aviv, a
bus exploded in Jerusalem–</p>
<p><strong>israeli officer</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p>****: Begin the first wave of air strikes.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of state</strong>: The Chinese have already made
their move. India and Pakistan have engaged and everyone in the Middle
East is going at Israel. Time to start picking sides, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Forget picking sides–first, are we
safe?</p>
<p><strong>secretary of homeland security</strong>: We’ve increased
security at all entry points: water ports, airports and border
patrol.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I want the National Guard put on the
border. As for the rest of it . let’s not jump into the fray just
yet.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Mr. President, I urge you
to–</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Let’s just wait, okay?! Maybe he’ll come
back. Maybe he’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Clock’s ticking, Mr. Veidt.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I know. I’m meeting the toy people, yes?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Eleven-thirty. They want to talk to you
about some new villains for the “Ozymandias” line.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: All the old villains are dead.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: What’s with everybody today? Everyone’s
on this death trip.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I suppose the threat of war has that effect.
ACROSS THE WAY, Dan enters the building, intercepts Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Adrian, I need to talk to you. Adrian looks put
off.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Dan, I’m sorry, this is a bad time.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: But what about what happened with ion? Adrian
excuses himself from his Assistant.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Jon’s departure is terrible. Not only for
what’s happening in the world now, but for what could have happened. The
energy project he and I were working on–it’s dead now .</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach came to see me again. Maybe there’s
something to this mask killer thing.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Are you still preoccupied with the ramblings
of that lunatic? I really don’t have time for this, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Adrian walks away, continuing on with
his Assistant when a MAN in a TRENCHCOAT approaches the pair. He DRAWS A
GUN on them .</p>
<p><strong>personal assistant</strong>: Sometimes I can’t bear to watch
the news. It makes it so hard to be optimistic Is that a gun? Dan sees
what’s happening–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Adrian! BANG! The man SHOOTS the Assistant in
the gut; Adrian immediately springs into action–he moves with
unbelievable speed and quickness, grabbing a velvet ROPE-STANCHION–
–DEFLECTING A SECOND BULLET with it– –and SMASHING IT INTO THE FACE OF
THE ASSASSIN, knocking him into a FOUNTAIN. SECURITY GUARDS run, guns
drawn, toward the fountain where Adrian GRAPPLES with the dazed man.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Mr. Veidt! Let us handle it!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Wait, he’s got a poison capsule! He JAMS his
fingers into the Assassin’s mouth when Dan arrives.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Don’t bite down, you scum! I want to know
who sent you! The Assassin’s eyes BULGE</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I want to know who’s behind this! The
Assassin CHOKES and dies. Adrian DROPS him, unanswered. He looks over at
Dan, frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh my god. Where’s Adrian now?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Talking to the cops. Thank god he’s still in
great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the
world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he’s as fast as
I’ve ever seen him</p>
<p>****: What about you? What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m not sure. I can’t go stay with my mom-
-I’m sure that’s the first place they’ll look. But I need to get out of
the city. It’s only a matter of time before they find me.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Listen, why don’t you . how about you stay at
my place?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh, Dan, I couldn’t impose–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It wouldn’t be an imposition, I have an extra
room. We’re friends. And with everything that’s been happening</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’re buying into Rorschach’s “mask killer”
theory?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t know. But it can’t hurt to be safe.
Besides, I’ve already had one wanted person visit me, another one won’t
make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>****: So this guy who tried to kill Adrian–who was he?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Some local low-life named Roy Chess</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rorschach investigates the apartment of
ROY CHESS, Adrian’s would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy.
Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch nearby, a
pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches into the pockets. He
pulls out some cash, credit cards– –and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It
says Chess was a security guard . and then Rorschach remembers the
pension check he saw at Moloch’s house. From Pyramid Industries.
Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The computer is on
and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries. Rorschach navigates the
server until he finds the EMPLOYEE</p>
<p><strong>directory.</strong>: Once in the directory he pauses for a
second. Then he types in a name: “Jane Slater.” A photo of Janey Slater
pops up–“Status: RETIRED.” Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at
the connection.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Rorschach’s Journal, October 19th.
Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Proves mask killer theory–the
murderer is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the key. Rorschach
approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and finds an ENVELOPE. He
opens it and finds a NOTE that reads: “Tonight 11:30, M.”</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Checked mail drop, got a message from
Moloch. Was just going to pay him a visit. Rorschach turns down an
alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He reaches behind the dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: My things are where I left them. My coat.
My gloves</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Still in his POV, we watch him put each
article on. Then he pulls out his MASK.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: . my face. Rorschach pulls his mask on,
FILLING THE SCREEN</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: MOLOCH’S EYES staring fearfully out the
rainy window. Rorschach APPEARS in the darkness behind him.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Somebody tried to shoot the world’s
smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON:
MOLOCH’S HAND. An ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a
NOTE.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries.
So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr. Manhattan allegedly gave
cancer to. And last time I was here, I saw a pension check sent to you
from the same company– obviously a front set up by whoever it is that
killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr. Manhattan over the edge, that wants
us masks dead. Is that why you left me a note in my mail drop? You have
something to confess? Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch’s
staring eyes. A PISTOL lies on the table–Moloch’s dead. Rorschach
carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch’s hand. It’s the note Rorschach had
left in Moloch’s refrigerator, the one that reads: “LOOK BEHIND YOU.”
Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No. No, no, no</p>
<p><strong>them out unharmed.</strong>: Moloch’s corpse stares at
Rorschach. Rorschach TEARS OPEN the cupboards, pulling items off the
shelves.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Framed. Set up. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Heh. Never. Never surrender. Rorschach
takes an AEROSOL CAN and a PEPPER SHAKER.</p>
<p><strong>alright. i hope you’re ready, “hero.”</strong>: Rorschach’s
mask DISAPPEARS back into darkness.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: When you are</p>
<p><strong>swat cop 1</strong>: It’s a bum tip, I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>swat cop 2-</strong>: Keep your eyes open. SWAT Cop 1 moves
down the hall, carelessly ahead of formation- –BEHIND HIM, Rorschach
APPEARS out of the darkness. He IGNITES the AEROSOL CAN’S STREAM,
SPRAYING THE COPS WITH FIRE. They fall back, screaming, shooting. SWAT
Cop 1 catches the worst of it–he DROPS AND ROLLS on the floor, trying to
extinguish the flames on him. Rorschach BOLTS upstairs, IGNITING the
staircase behind him. Pandemonium.</p>
<p><strong>swat cop 3</strong>: Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>swat cop 2</strong>: Upstairs! He’s upstairs! Go!</p>
<p><strong>swat cop 3</strong>: Where is he?! Send the second team in!
Graves is down! And we need a fire unit. All this smoke–</p>
<p><strong>swat cop 2</strong>: Stay calm, the file says he never goes
armed. Rorschach APPEARS, blowing PEPPER INTO COP 2’S EYES.</p>
<p><strong>swat cop 3</strong>: Get out of the way! I don’t have room
to– SWAT Cop 3 CLEARS his line of fire and finds Rorschach</p>
<p><strong>shit</strong>: The HOOK BLOWS THE BODY-ARMORED COP OVER THE
RAILING.</p>
<p><strong>det. fine</strong>: We’ve got him. There’s no way out. From
the second floor, Rorschach SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, snarling like a
rabid dog, landing hard on the concrete. His ankle TWISTS, dropping him
to the ground. Rorschach struggles to get to his feet. When he looks up
he finds TWENTY COPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE before him. A loaded, pregnant
pause. The COPS RUSH FORWARD.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: But Rorschach holds up a gloved hand.
And they all stop, unsure what this lunatic will do next.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Ten years. I’ve waited for this. He
beckons them forward. The cops PILE INTO HIM. Rorschach brutally
disables six cops before he is overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No pain. Must get up. Find who framed me–
A Cop KICKS HIM in the throat. Rorschach drops again.</p>
<p><strong>fine</strong>: Get that mask off him!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: I got it. Christ, he stinks!</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No no no NO NO NO! The Cop peels back the
shifting mask to reveal the Homeless Man from the news stand. He screams
at them wildly.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: My face! Give it back to me! Rorschach is
finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch’s house blazes in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Noon. Thought I’d let you sleep in. Laurie
smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark? She touches his
shoulder as she turns into the living room, then turns on the TV:</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: Today, police searched the apartment of
Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs
was captured last night and charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi,
formerly known as the supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found shot in the
head at point blank range. Both Dan and Laurie stop what they’re doing,
eyes fixed on the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES.</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: Inside the decrepit apartment, police
discovered stacks of right-wing literature, including several years of
back issues of the ultra-conservative publication, “The New
Frontiersman.” We asked “New Frontiersman” editor, Hector Godfrey, for
comment.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A clip of the EDITOR being interviewed. We
see Seymour, who we met at the news stand, in the background.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Rorschach is an American patriot and we are
proud that he reads this publication.</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: During his capture, Kovacs assaulted
and severely injured at least nine police officers, shooting one officer
with a grappling gun. That officer is in serious but stable
condition.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues
to intensify. Both India and Pakistan alluded that the use of nuclear
weapons is not out of the question– Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting
to hear the war talk.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: That mask’s eaten Rorschach’s brains
away.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: He wasn’t always like that. We were a great
team–tactically, he was brilliant. But I don’t know, something about
this murder charge I just can’t see Rorschach shooting Moloch.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: He shot a cop with a grappling gun.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Don’t remind me, I made that thing for him. But
a regular gun just seems too . ordinary</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I could
just leave the planet. Like Jon.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Now, that’s funny. That’s what you call
Jon’s teleportation?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Walter Kovacs. Is that your name?
Walter?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No. The Psychiatrist sits back,
considering Rorschach carefully.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Let me explain your situation here,
Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may be able to convince them that
you should to be treated medically, in a hospital, which I believe is
best for you. But the authorities want to put you in General
Population.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: A prison is a prison.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Yes, but the difference is,
downstairs? They’ll eat you alive. He holds up a RORSCHACH
BLOT-CARD.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Now . . tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>flash of</strong>: A DEAD DOG. Bloody, horrible.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: A pretty butterfly. The Psychiatrist
holds up another blot-card.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: How about this one? What do you see
here?</p>
<p><strong>flash of</strong>: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his
MOTHER, HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When she
catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the face. Shuts the
door on him.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Some nice flowers. The Psychiatrist eyes
him, dubious. Holds up another card.</p>
<p><strong>flash of</strong>: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at
TWO OLDER BOYS, teasing him. Calling him “son of a whore.” Rorschach
just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his face.
Suddenly, Rorschach’s face changes. He attacks the Boy like a wild
animal–biting, clawing .</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Clouds. The Psychiatrist sighs, puts the
cards down.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do
that?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Why are you here with me, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Because I want to make you well.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: There’s other men in here with behavior
more extreme than mine. Of course, they’re not famous. You want to know
about Rorschach, doctor? I’ll tell you about Rorschach</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I was investigating a kidnap case. Blair
Roche, 6 year old girl. I was young then. Too soft on criminals. I let
them live.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Broke a man’s arm to get a tip. Led me to
the missing girl’s location.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I knew the girl was here. But when I
searched the place I found nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: And then I found her.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: . to the dogs, still fighting over the
BONE, which we now recognize as a small, HUMAN FEMUR–that of the little
girl. Rorschach clenches his hands in fury, his fists tremble and
suddenly, he relaxes. Calms. Rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard. He
reaches for a large CLEAVER .</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: It was dark when the murderer got back.
As dark as it gets.</p>
<p><strong>child molester</strong>: You think I had something to do with
that girl? I didn’t! Where’s your evidence? Rorschach calmly points to
body of the dog.</p>
<p><strong>child molester</strong>: Okay, I confess! I kidnapped her! I
killed her! Arrest me!</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Men get arrested. Rorschach RAISES THE
CLEAVER, high over his head</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: RORSCHACH Dogs get put down. Rorschach
SWINGS the cleaver DOWN. Blood SPATTERS his mask.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: A tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm
blood splashed my face. It was Walter Kovacs who screamed, who closed
his eyes– it was Rorschach who opened them again. The silence reels out
RORSCHACH You see, Doctor. God didn’t kill that little girl, fate didn’t
butcher her and destiny didn’t feed her to those dogs. If God saw what
any of us did that night, he didn’t seem to mind. From then on, I knew.
God doesn’t make the world this way. We do. The Psychiatrist rises
shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: I can’t help him.</p>
<p><strong>random voice</strong>: Hey Rorschach, I heard your momma was
a whore! A cruel RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER and the mass conversation begins
again as Rorschach takes his place in the food line. A HUGE PRISONER
moves in behind him. He whispers:</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Hey, Rorschach. You’re pretty famous,
right? Y’know, I’m pretty famous too. Maybe I can give you my autograph.
The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rorschach doesn’t register this. He
waits for the FRY-COOK behind the counter to turn away– –then casually
reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER BASKET from its mount– –the
Prisoner JABS the shiv forward–Rorschach spins, GRIPPING the man’s wrist
and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO THE MAN’S FACE. The man SHRIEKS
like a FIRE WHISTLE and CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on
Rorschach. Rorschach is calm as he’s dragged away. As the injured man’s
screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once again goes
silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes of the room, marking
each one. And in the silence he speaks, his icy voice carrying
easily.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: None of you understand. I’m not locked up
in here with you. Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You’re locked up in here with me.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE NITE-OWL UNIFORM, staring its blank,
empty stare. Laurie stares back, alone down here, fascinated with the
costume, the gadgets, the whole place. She wanders to the OWL-SHIP,
whose tarp has been pulled back. She runs her finger through the DUST
caked on the windshield.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: All these gadgets and there isn’t even a
dash lighter She hits a BUTTON–the lights inside go DIM. Creepy. She
hits the button again to turn the lights back on but nothing</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Laurie?! Dan BOLTS for the basement door,
thoughts of the mask-killer on his mind.</p>
<p><strong>laurie!</strong>: Dan grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Where are you?! Dan SPRAYS the fire. Laurie
stumbles from the smoke, out of the Owl-Ship. Dan’s got the fire under
control now.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m so sorry–I hit the wrong button. I was
looking for the lighter in.there.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t smoke. Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m fine, but your ship–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Ah, that’s mostly just soot. Archie’s pretty
resilient.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Archie?</p>
<p>****: Short for Archimedes–Merlin’s owl. I’m just glad you’re okay. I
heard you scream and well, you know, after the Comedian–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Still with the mask-killer theory? Rorschach
is insane.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon exiled;
Someone tries to shoot Adrian; Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me
uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dan goes to a BANK OF SWITCHES on the
wall. Flicking them, the Owl-Chamber LIGHTS UP. Hidden FANS dissipate
the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: How did you ever afford all this?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: My Dad was in corporate banking. He left me
quite a bit. Which always surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: How did he die?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Mugging. He was shot. As Dan cleans up, Laurie
watches him, like she’s seeing him for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You really do worry about me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about you, I
mean, we’re, y’know, friends– Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES
him. It’s what Dan’s been wanting all this time . but he pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Sorry, I</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What’s wrong? But Dan is already walking up
the stairs, pathetic. Laurie’s left there, alone. The Owl-Costume
looming in the background.</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: It’s been a long time, Rorschach.
Rorschach turns to see TWO THUGS standing side by side, one muscle
bound, the other very fat, staring at him through the bars. PAN DOWN: To
reveal a MIDGET between them–the supervillain known as the BIG
FIGURE–his silver hair combed neatly back, a big CIGAR perched in his
tiny mouth.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Big Figure. Small world.</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: I like that. But you know, it is a small
world in here. I’ve been in it for–how long now, Billy?</p>
<p><strong>dumb thug</strong>: Twenty years, Mr. Figure.</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: That’s right. Twenty years since you and
that owl fella put me away. Rorschach– that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute now. And when he does, this place is gonna explode.
Then you die by inches.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Tall order.</p>
<p><strong>fat thug</strong>: I’m gonna tear this guy a new hole!</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: Relax, Lloyd. Soon. Chuckling, Big
Figure walks off down the long, shadowed corridor. Rorschach continues
staring, straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Dan, naked, on his knees in the center of
an INFINITE FIELD OF BLACKNESS. No corners, no exits. In the DISTANCE,
he sees a FEMALE FORM. Desperate, he runs to her. It’s Laurie, waiting
for him IN COSTUME. They kiss. She tears at him passionately. His SKIN
suddenly TEARS AWAY like wrapping paper. Beneath the false skin, Dan
wears his NITE- OWL COSTUME. Confident, he touches her face. She smiles
with palpable heat. They kiss. In the background, a NUCLEAR BLAST
ERUPTS. Still kissing, the</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Dan? Is everything okay? I heard you coming
down the stairs Descending the stairs, she finds Dan before his costume,
naked. He fiddles with an OWL-WING THROWING WEAPON.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Mask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation. I feel
so powerless, so I’ve been afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of how
much I need it. He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the
dark.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: So. Let’s take the ship out.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Who’s to know? I used to be a “masked
avenger” too, remember? I’m used to getting up at three in the morning
to do something stupid. Besides, I’m already a wanted lady, you’re
already in trouble for hiding me, how much more trouble can we be in?
Just give me a second–can’t go out like this. She jogs upstairs. Dan
turns to the empty, waiting suit.</p>
<p><strong>pan up</strong>: DAN’S COSTUMED BODY. The Nite Owl suit is
fantastic, intricate, but above the belly . it just barely fits, Dan
managing to CLICK it closed.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I can’t believe it still fits. Luckily I
constructed it with material that was elastic and– Dan turns as Laurie
appears at the door, decked in her BLACK SPANDEX. SILK SPECTRE, looking
every bit as good as seventeen-</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: –form fitting</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m ready. Dan turns and sees his reflection
in the owl-Ship’s window.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Let’s have some cloud cover.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It’s so beautiful</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hang on. Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward
the VELDT BUILDING.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Got to clean her up a bit. I’m sure Adrian
wouldn’t want to impede the course of justice. Heading straight for the
building, Dan JIGS at the last moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE
V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the skyscraper’s center. The water washes clean
the years of dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Look! Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED
IN FLAME. Dan’s jaw sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they
zoom closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: There’s children in there!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m putting the water cannons on the lower
stories.</p>
<p><strong>you.</strong>: Can you escort the people over? She watches
him move, quick, confident. She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m on it. Nite Owl.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hi. If you could all form a line, we’ll have
you out of here in just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>atop the ship</strong>: Dan latches the steering column into
its roof socket. He stands; Takes a deep, chest-expanding breath. Who
has he been kidding? This is who he is. Flicking a switch OLD JAZZ plays
pleasantly.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Anybody want coffee?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I can’t believe we did that! That was
actually fun</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah. He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes
locked onto hers. He knows what he wants and this time he’s not afraid
of it He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they slide
each other’s masks off. Their mouths melt together.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It was good, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah, saving those people from the fire. Taking
Archie out Laurie swats him on the chest–that’s not what she meant. Dan
grins, having fun with her.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It–you were unbelievable. They kiss.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: So . what do we do next? Dan sits up,
serious. Very serious.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’ve been thinking about that. And I believe we
have certain obligations to our fraternity.</p>
<p>****: I think we should spring Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: He’s dead, Rorschach–the riot’s already
begun. While everyone’s distracted, we thought we’d bring you a
housewarming gift. Something from the machine shop. The Fat Thug wheels
an ELECTRICAL WELDER to the door. Rorschach sits, idly TEARING his
PRISON SHIRT into STRIPS.</p>
<p><strong>fat thug</strong>: Hey Boss, y’notice? None of that “small
world, tall order” crap, cuz he knows once we slice open this lock, he’s
next on the block.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Fat chance. The Fat Thug reddens. He
DIVES forward, HANDS SWIPING for Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>fat thug</strong>: You’re dead, Rorschach! We got a prison
full of killers out here! What’ve you got? Rorschach SPINS, WRAPPING A
SHIRT-STRIP AROUND HIS WRISTS, trapping the Fat Thug’s hands inside the
cell.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Your hands. My pleasure. Rorschach SNAPS
Fat Thug’s pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS. Rorschach roughly binds the
fingers around the bars. Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat
Thug’s body.</p>
<p><strong>dumb thug</strong>: I can’t reach the lock. Should I cut the
bars?</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: This riot won’t last. And I’ve been
waiting twenty years for this Big Figure nods to the Dumb Thug, who then
grabs Fat Thug’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>dumb thug</strong>: Nothing personal, big guy.</p>
<p><strong>fat thug</strong>: Boss, you can’t be serious! Wait– Dumb
Thug SNAPS Fat Thug’s neck. He then CUTS OFF Fat Thug’s hands with the
welder, pushes the corpse out of the way to reach the lock. Big Figure
grins at Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: Now you find out what the score is.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: One-nothing. Come and get me.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Look, Dan, I’m glad you were able to
rediscover your calling in life, but I think you’re getting carried
away. You’re talking about springing a homicidal psychopath from
prison.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach may be sick, but I think he’s on to
something–four heroes attacked in a week is not a coincidence. I mean,
that whole cancer thing with ion, does that make sense to you? You
didn’t contract cancer from him. He says as Laurie’s about to light a
cigarette. She changes her mind.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Why would someone want to drive ion away?
Look what’s happening now. With Jon gone it looks like we’re headed for
another World War. Who would want that?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: The Owl-Ship
approaches a ROOFTOP with a HELIPAD. On the helipad is a HELICOPTER with
the Veidt Enterprises LOGO.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t know. But I know someone who might be
able to help. Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re leaving town? So you do believe
Rorschach’s theory.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Please. Right now, I’m not concerned with
this so-called mask-killer, I’m concerned with the mass killer called
war, or have you not heard. On ! A WALL SIZED MIRROR turns into a
TV:</p>
<p><strong>cnn newscaster</strong>: –US Aircraft Carriers have already
moved into the Persian Gulf and US Battleships have left Japan en route
to the Far East</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It’s happening Dan breaks away from the
terrible news, follows Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: All the more reason we need to get to the
bottom of this. Maybe we can get Jon to come back in the process and
stop all this madness.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Nothing we do will bring Jon back! But I
think you know that already. And breaking Rorschach out of prison
certainly isn’t the answer.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach’s been the only one investigating
this from the start. Without him, we’re starting at the beginning and we
don’t have that kind of time. We need your help, Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I’m leaving, Dan. And I suggest you both do
the same. Adrian pulls on a thick WINTER COAT and heads upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Where are you going to go?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Antarctica. It takes Dan a moment to realize
Adrian is serious. By then, Adrian’s halfway into the helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Good luck, Dan. He says it sincerely. Dan
watches the helicopter fly off.</p>
<p><strong>big figure</strong>: Hurry Lloyd! I wanna smell this
sonofabitch cooking! The lock MELTS AWAY. Rorschach climbs onto his bunk
as Dumb Thug enters, JABBING the electric welder at him menacingly.
Rorschach drives his HEEL into the porcelain TOILET BOWL, SHATTERING IT.
WATER SPILLS across the floor. Rorschach KICKS Dumb Thug in the stomach;
Dumb Thug buckles, then SLIPS in the water–Dumb Thug falls, welder still
in hand as he hits the water Dumb Thug’s hand FUSES to the welder as
ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH HIM. He collapses, smoking. Dead.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a
toilet before. Obvious, really. Big Figure looks very small and alone
now</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Two-nothing. Your move. Panic stricken,
Big Figure moves, or rather, runs. Rorschach calmly follows him out of
the cell.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You don’t have to do this. I know the whole
crimefighting thing wasn’t necessarily your choice in life.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No. But this is. She moves next to him.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: But I’m not doing it for Rorschach or even
for Jon. And I’m sure as hell not doing if for the Comedian. They look
at each other–Dan knows who she’s doing it for. The Owl-Ship is upon the
prison now</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Look! They see a RIOT below–Inmates spilling
out into the yard, overwhelming the Correctional Officers on the ground;
TOWER GUARDS take shots at some of the Inmates; Broken glass, broken
furniture parts scattered through the yard; SMOKE emits from inside the
prison.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and
suddenly there’s a riot. I wonder if that’s a coincidence. They descend
toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE. The Tower Guards,
stunned at the sight of the Owl-Ship, begin SHOOTING at it. The bullets
bounce right off.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Put your ear-plugs in.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: How are we going to find Rorschach in all of
this?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: When he and I were partners, we each had
tracking implants put under our skin so old Archie here could find us if
either one of us were ever in trouble. Let’s see if Rorschach kept his
in. Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There’s a BLIP on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: He’s in that wing. Dan steers the ship toward
the Maximum Security Wing. 9</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: How do we know he’s still alive? They come
upon Rorschach’s cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE of Dumb Thug. Sees
the CUT OFF HANDS of Fat Thug, HANGING from the bars.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: He’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Is that–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach? Rorschach!</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Hello, Daniel, Ms. Jupiter. Excuse me, I
just have to visit the men’s room. He disappears into the dark bathroom.
Laurie watches after him in stunned disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh, for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big arrest
like that once. Had to redesign the costume after that– Rorschach exits
the bathroom, wiping his hands.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: We can leave now. He walks off.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Are you sure you’re ready? We don’t want to
go diving head-first into things.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Good Advice. I’m sure there are many
who’d agree with you. Behind them: BLOODY WATER FLOODS from the bathroom
door as they go.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Good to see you in uniform, Daniel. What
happened? Finally taking the mask-killer seriously?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Of course you haven’t been attacked yet.
Funny, most everyone else has.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean? We came here
to rescue you, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to turn
the screechers off, so we’ll be drawing fire. The owl-Ship rises to the
roof. They all jump in.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach, you remember how to handle
Archie?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I believe so. Rorschach sits in the
pilot’s seat. Dan turns to Laurie, high on adrenaline and love. Dan
moves in to kiss her–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Give us a second–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I don’t think this can wait.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What? What is it Dan looks up, through the
windshield, and sees– –Dr. Manhattan WALKING ACROSS THE CLOUDS–STRAIGHT
FOR THE</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It `s him. The ship COLLIDES with
Dr. Manhattan, who PASSES THROUGH into the CABIN with a SHOWER of BLUE
PARTICLES–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Hello Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: They said you were on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I am on Mars. You and I are about to
have a conversation there.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Where? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: You are going to try to convince me
to save the world.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Wait, what? You’re taking her to Mars? No, she
can’t–Laurie, I don’t know about</p>
<p><strong>this</strong>: Laurie looks at Dan then at Dr. Manhattan.
Comprehending</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I have to go, Dan. Jon and I, we’re going to
talk. Maybe we’ll find some way out of this mess the world’s gotten
itself in. I’ll be okay. Really.</p>
<p><strong>laurie–</strong>: Laurie and Dr. Manhattan BURST INTO
PARTICLES–they’re gone. Dan stares at the space where Laurie just
was.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No time for heartbreak, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dan notes TWO BLIPS on the RADAR.</p>
<p><strong>inside the owl ship</strong>: Dan takes the controls.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Let’s try and lose them in the city. He hits
the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: So. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: J–huc? Hhhhhhh– Laurie GRIPS her throat and
TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls into Jon, waiting for her at the
bottom. She CLAWS at him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Oh. Forgive me. These things
sometimes slip my mind. He TOUCHES her mouth, forming a small ATMOSPHERE
around her. She HEAVES in air, retching and choking at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Jon, you stupid bastard! Listen, you better
not forget this air supply or whatever it is Oh shit. Laurie stands up
before Jon’s huge GLASS PALACE.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: –and heads straight for a SUBWAY
TUNNEL</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: oh no.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Tactical error, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I know– They head straight for the subway–
–when the tunnel opens up– –Dan SWERVES to the adjacent track just in
time.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Shit. Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around
the skyscrapers, the Empire State Building . but the copter’s still
there. Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter follows
the Owl-Ship around to the East River . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to
be found The copter hovers there. Baffled.</p>
<p><strong>gang member 1</strong>: Yo, y’all hear? Some super owl dude
broke Rorschach outta prison.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Rorschach? That fool put my cousin in
a</p>
<p><strong>gang member 2</strong>: You say Nite Owl broke him out?
Didn’t he write a book or something? He lives over a garage near
here.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Does he now</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: It’s just like old times, Sal. Nite Owl and
Silk Spectre back at it again.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Sally Jupiter on the other end in
California, watching the same footage.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I always knew Laurie had it in her. Sorry for
waking you, Hollis.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: I may be retired from the costume, but my
sleeping habits have never changed. There’s a KNOCK at Hollis’s
door.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Who–there’s someone at the door. It might be
Dan and Laurie–they may need help. I better go. Hollis hangs up, heads
to the door, excited. He opens the</p>
<p><strong>door–</strong>: –and the Gang Members PILE INTO HIM. The
picture SLOWS DOWN. Hollis turns, mouth bleeding. HOLLIS’ POV IS SEPIA
TONED. The gang appears as a COLLECTION of VILLAINS in COSTUMES.</p>
<p><strong>slow, sepia</strong>: A young Hollis is in his old COSTUME.
The VOICES come from the present, while Hollis is lost in the past.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: In his SLO-MO world, Hollis PASTES at
Villain in the mouth– in reality, he gets nailed. This intercutting
continues until the Gang Leader picks up the GOLD STATUE of Hollis in
costume whose base reads: IN GRATITUDE</p>
<p><strong>gang member 1</strong>: Hold on, Derf, are you sure this is
the right guy–he, he’s just an old man.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Then I’m probably doing him a favor.
Hollis, old again, looks up. The SHADOW of the statue</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I hate this. How long are we going to
stay down here? Daniel! Dan says nothing. Rorschach puts on his
costume.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You’re letting fear paralyze you. And
that woman–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hey! We took enough unnecessary risks bringing
Archie up so you could get your spare costume. We stay put until it
cools down out there–they’re looking for us.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Unnecessary? Cowering in the sludge, from
the authorities, that’s unnecessary. Rorschach pulls his mask on,
turns.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: While we waste time, the mask-killer gets
closer. We need to get to Pyramid Industries. Dan sits at the
COMPUTER.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I know, you told me already. I’m tapping into
all the databases, finding out about the company–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Sitting at a computer? No. We need to
trace the killer–hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people. You’ve
forgotten how we do things. You’ve been lazing around too long.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Listen, I HAVE HAD IT! Who the hell do you
think you are? You live off people while insulting them, and no one
complains because they think you’re a goddamn lunatic! Dan turns away,
shaking. He leans against the console.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. Maybe
you’re right, maybe–</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Dan turns. Rorschach holds out an open
hand.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You are a good friend. I’m sorry that it
is sometimes difficult with me. Touched, Dan shakes his hand. An
awkward, lovely moment.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hey forget it It’s okay, man. Releasing his
hand with some effort, Dan sits, invigorated.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re right. It’s time to head up.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Let’s really start plumbing the depths.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Our conversation commences when you
surprise me with the information that you and Dreiberg have been
sleeping together.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You . know about me and Dan?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Not yet. But in a few moments, you’re
going to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Jon, I’m having enough problems right now
without getting into your predestination crap.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Why does my perception of time
distress you so?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Because. If you already know the future, why
were you surprised when I left you, or when that reporter ambushed you?
Why even debate if you already know the outcome?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Because everything is pre-ordained.
Even my responses.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you know
what a relief it is to be with somebody human, like Dan?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: You mean you’re sleeping with Dan
Dreiberg? Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony’s edge.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: But you already know . You said–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I said, often, that you were my only
remaining link with the world. Now that link is shattered. Don’t you see
the futility of asking me to save a world that I no longer have any
stake in?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: That’s ridiculous. The Earth is too
important to hinge on one relationship.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Not to me. My red world here means
more to me than your blue one. I’ll show you around if you like. The
giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Are you doing this? I’m not in the mood for
jokes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand
the gravity of the situation. The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO
THE AIR</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You sure this is the correct location,
Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes in
industrial plastics. At least they did.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I tapped into all the databases–tax records,
business registries, real estate records–trying to get a bead on who’s
behind Pyramid but it’s a never ending paper trail. Rorschach
investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT– –he turns his
FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE squatting in the warehouse.
Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the Homeless People run away.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: They’re harmless, Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Daniel. Rorschach is looking down at
something. Dan heads over and sees a DEAD BODY in the early stages of
decomposition. He turns the body over–bullet between the eyes just like
Moloch . but we recognize the corpse–it’s journalist Doug Roth.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hey, I know this man.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled
Dr. Manhattan on national television.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No I didn’t watch that interview. This was the
guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was
probably working to set up Veidt also. Dan stands there thinking. As if
hit with an epiphany. He opens his mouth like he can’t believe what he’s
going to say.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach. What, what if it’s Adrian?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no
sense.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: On the surface it doesn’t, but hear me
out–Adrian’s the only one who could’ve taken on the Comedian in hand to
hand combat. He’s the only one with the finances to create an entire
company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was
directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this
journalist with the whole cancer list.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: That doesn’t explain the attempt on
Veidt’s life.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he
could’ve had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk,
but–</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t know. Let’s go ask him.</p>
<p><strong>head scientist</strong>: Mr. Veidt, may I?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: By all means, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>head scientist</strong>: I just would like to say that when I
was first offered this position, I was hesitant. A multi-year commitment
to work in Antarctica?</p>
<p><strong>head scientist</strong>: But the opportunity to experiment
with Dr. Manhattan’s atomic fusion energy was too great for me to pass
up, too great for any of us to pass up. And now that our work is
finished, and we finally get to go home, I can say that it was all worth
it. Mr. Veidt, you are a genius. The world will be a better place
because of you.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I certainly hope so. The group applauds.
Then they sip their champagne. All except for Adrian The group goes
around congratulating each other, when suddenly the Head Scientist
COLLAPSES, choking. The others surround him, trying to help– –when one
by one they each start collapsing themselves– POISONED by the champagne.
Adrian regards them all, writhing on the floor, and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Something I can help you with, boys? They all
spin around, frightened at the costume.</p>
<p><strong>gang member 1</strong>: I told you we had the wrong guy. The
Gang Leader shits his pants as Dan steps closer.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: L-listen, I didn’t mean to kill that
old guy. Things just got outta hand</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What old guy?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: –and sees Dan gripping the bloody Gang
Leader by the THROAT, CHOKING him as the other Gang Members flee.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re dead! You and the rest of your gang,
you’re all DEAD! You know how much fire-power I’ve got floating out
there!? Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn god damn Dan begins to
break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Not now, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Rorschach’s Journal. Final entry?
Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is behind everything. Apparently, the
Owl- Ship is capable of the trip to Antarctica, but are we? I cannot
imagine a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is faster than Dreiberg and
myself. He used to joke that he was fast enough to catch a bullet. I
believe he could. He could kill us both, alone in’ the snow. No one
would know. Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the
building. He places his JOURNAL in an ENVELOPE.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I have done my best to make this legible.
Whether I am alive or dead upon this reading, know that whatever the
nature of this conspiracy–Adrian Veldt is responsible. He drops the
envelope into the MAIL SLOT, climbs back up the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: I appreciate your recent support and hope
the world survives long enough for this to reach you. For my own part, I
regret nothing. I have lived my life free of compromise, and step now
into the shadow without complaint. Rorschach. October 21st.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rorschach disappears into the dark
hatch. The Owl-Ship blasts off . disappearing, just as Seymour arrives.
Seymour picks up the mail and walks inside.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: SEYMOUR! Is that Dulmage’s editorial
cartoon?</p>
<p><strong>seymour</strong>: It’s the mail. Hey cool, someone sent us
their journal.</p>
<p>****: “Earlier today I came across what appeared to be a suicide. It
was later learned to be a homicide. Someone’s time was up.”</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: War’s coming, Seymour–I don’t wanna hear
some knob’s life story! Chuck it in the crank file! Seymour tosses
Rorschach’s journal into a PILE OF LETTERS.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Can’t you just tell me how this all ends and
save us the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: It ends with you in tears.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Tears. You mean I lose? You don’t come back
to Earth?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I return to Earth at some point. The
streets are filled with death.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You mean there’s going to be a war? An
actual, nuclear war?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I can’t be sure. I’m still
experiencing some static interference preventing any clear vision of
what lies ahead.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Static?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a
rare occurrence. The detonation of nuclear warheads could conceivably be
the cause.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Jon, you’ve got to stop it! Everyone will
die!</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: And the universe will not even
notice. See the dual moons. Aren’t they breathtaking? Above, TWO MOONS
cross overhead. One is HUGE, CRIMSON RED, the smaller is a delicate
SHELL PINK. Spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’re right, Jon–what does human life
matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I’m not going to debate you when you
clearly don’t see anything terribly miraculous about life. I guess
quantum physics doesn’t allow for miracles.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: No, thermodynamic miracles are–</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: On the Argyre Planitia? As you wish.
The structure descends. Laurie stomps down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: That’s it then. You can send me back to
Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all the other worthless humans. And
look, you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears and see? Not
a damp eye in the house. Maybe you’re wrong about everything.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jon is waiting for her at the bottom of
the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Laurie. You complain that I refuse to
see life on life’s terms. And yet you continuously refuse to see things
from my perspective. If only you’d try to see the whole continuum,
life’s pattern, you’d understand. But you deliberately shut it out as if
afraid to see.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m not afraid, okay? You want me to see
things your way? Go ahead, do that thing you do. She stands there, arms
folded, waiting. Then, just like earlier in the lab, Jon touches her
head–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You wanted to hear it, so I’m telling you,
okay?. Magic! Dreams! That’s what I had before. I was a hero
goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>laurie’s father</strong>: It’s not my fault you got old! What
do you have to complain about?! I’m putting food on the table for you
and your child. Why don’t you give your friend Eddie a call? Maybe he
can give you a better life!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It was a mistake–one time! Am I never– And
then they notice Laurie looking at them.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh. Oh, Laurie</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Tears run down little Laurie’s face. Her
parents are</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No. No, no, no, no not him</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: The comedian was your father.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: But he–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Attacked your mother. Yes. Two years
later he came back to her, to make amends. And you were conceived on
that day.</p>
<p><strong>no!!i</strong>: Laurie WHIPS a BOTTLE at the palace– –and the
huge glass construction CRUMBLES. Jon protects them with a FORCE FIELD
as debris collapses around them. Laurie sobs in the echoing SILENCE.
Jon’s eyes SHUT. He seems to feel . empathy. A TEAR slips down his
cheek. Laurie’s realization is a revelation for ion.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: The comedian is my father. I guess my life
is just one big joke.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I don’t think your life is a
joke.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Well, of course you’re going to say
that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: But I’ve changed my mind. There are
miracles in your world that are worth preserving.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What? But you were saying–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I tried to explain. Thermodynamic
miracles–events with odds against so astronomical, like oxygen turning
into gold. I have longed to witness such a thing and yet I neglect that
in human coupling, millions upon millions of cells compete to create
life over generation after generation: Until finally, your mother loves
a man–Edward Blake, the Comedian–a man she has every reason to hate. And
out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds, it was you, only
you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from all of that chaos;
Your creation is like . turning air into gold. A miracle.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: But if my birth is a miracle you, you could
say that about anyone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Yes, anyone in the world. But the
world is so crowded with miracles that they become commonplace and we
forget. I forget. They stand there in silence. Connected for the first
time in years.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Now. Dry your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>from above</strong>: We see the full CRATER–the ARGYRE
PLANITIA. Round, with two, eye-like BOULDERS set side by side, a RIDGE
of land curling below . like a smiley-face.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: And let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’ve got a large reading ahead. Anything that’s
emitting that much heat out here, must be a pretty big facility.
Adrian.</p>
<p>****: We’re not going to make it, are we? Rorschach says nothing .
when a halting WHINE sputters from the engines. A HUGE CLIFF APPEARS
before them.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: The engines–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: They’re icing up, hold on! Dan pulls the stick
back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We just lost the engines–find something to grab
on to! The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS across
the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The engines are de-icing. You sure I can’t fit
you with something warmer?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Fine like this.</p>
<p><strong>of war in the world.</strong>: Adrian sighs and hits the
remote–the screens become ONE IMAGE–ALEXANDER THE GREAT slicing the
Gordian Knot. By Adrian’s feet is an exotic LYNX. Its unnatural beauty
almost hides a feral danger in its eyes. Adrian pets the beast.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: See this painting? Alexander the Great.
Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he struck North for Gordium, where the
world’s greatest puzzle waited. A great knot, impossible to untie. For a
young man determined to rule the world, it was a challenge he couldn’t
resist. So he sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral thinking, you
see. Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: What is it, girl? He hits the remote–the TV
screens switch to MULTIPLE VIEWS OF Dan and Rorschach, heading toward
Karnak.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Ah. It’s all right, girl. Everything’s all
right.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Really, getting even this far is an
admirable effort, given their limitations. Of course the ice they’re
skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks. Let’s hope they don’t
overstep themselves. On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the
door.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Let’s hope they know when to stop.</p>
<p>****: I don’t understand any of this. Adrian’s a pacifist. He’s never
killed anyone in his life. He’s a vegetarian for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Hitler was a vegetarian. If you’re
squeamish, leave him to me. We won’t get a second chance.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Mind your manners.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dan draws his PEN-LASER.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Adrian, don’t make me– Adrian picks up a GOLDEN
SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with
the tray– –then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan’s NOSE. Blood SPRAYS,
Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Now. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You know! You killed the Comedian! You set up
Rorschach! You created Pyramid Industries, hired all those people, gave
them cancer and blamed it on Jon!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: What we always intended–to improve the
world. As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a FORK. He
tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian effortlessly dodges the
blow, GRABS Rorschach’s mask, TWISTS it, then KNEES him in the gut.
Rorschach drops to the floor. Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan
helps Rorschach up and they follow.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I never intended to kill the Comedian– that
was an accident. Part of his duties as a government operative was to
keep track of all former masked heroes, make sure there was no rocking
of the boat. He must have liked Rorschach because he allowed him to
continue to exist. I had thought that the Comedian might be incompetent,
but he disproved that hypothesis when he discovered what was really
going on. here in Karnak–no easy task. Even my staff was unaware–I made
sure to keep each department separate.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but
still, he understood the scope of what I was trying to accomplish.
Frankly, I never thought he’d actually talk. But by the time he visited
poor Moloch, he was cracking badly. So I had to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: After Blake, I neutralized Jon–a plan nearly
a decade in the works after analyzing confidential psychological
profiles which predicted his withdrawal from human existence. By then,
Rorschach’s mask theory, ’though erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I
faked my own assassination–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Why take that risk? What if the hitman shot you
first instead of your assistant?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I suppose I’d have to be fast enough to
catch the bullet then, wouldn’t I? Adrian smiles enigmatically.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: After apprehending my own assassin, I shoved
a cyanide capsule in his mouth, disposing of him, and soon after that,
the journalist Doug Roth, tying up all the loose ends if you will. Then
I knew nothing stood in the way of my triumph.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I’m firing a beam of concentrated energy,
synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself, into the hearts of nine key
regions around the globe, crossing all traditional politics and
ideologies;</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Paris, Tehran, Kashmir, Beijing, Taiwan,
Pyongyang, London, Jerusalem, New York– destroying approximately three
million people.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Three million people? You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: He’s not. Listen to his voice.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach, he’s making it up!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I understand your disbelief, Dan. When I
began the plan ten years ago, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the
necessary sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct. What we were doing
with the Watchmen was pointless–the savage nature of humankind would
inevitably lead to the end of the world. So in order to save the world,
I had to trick it–to frighten the world towards salvation with history’s
greatest practical joke.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: By killing millions of people? And when were
you planning on doing this?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: When? Dan, my dear friend, I am the smartest
man in the world–do you seriously think I’d explain my master stroke if
there remained even the slightest chance of you affecting it’s
outcome?</p>
<p>****: I did it thirty minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>from this minute on–i will be watching.</strong>: Suddenly
the SOUND of a rising, HOWLING WIND and the LIGHTNING STRIKES begin,
CRASHING TO EARTH with savage, blistering force. Their expended blue
energy SPREADS like</p>
<p><strong>liquid fire, flooding through the streets.</strong>: People
SCREAM and RUN. As the LIGHT OVERTAKES the unlucky ones, they are
instantly BLOWN TO ASH–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: : –as is the News Vendor; the Pakistani
and Indian Soldiers; the Chinese Battleships; the Israeli Missile
Control Room; Paris; the Great Wall of China. Destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: God Jon, what was that? Jon looks around the
street. Even he is awe-struck.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Interference. Cataclysmic
interference. Laurie looks up and screams. THOUSANDS OF BLACK
SILHOUETTES are IMPRINTED on the STREET and the WALLS. Everywhere. There
is no rubble–some buildings have simply disintegrated.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Was it a war? It doesn’t seem like–</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Not a war. I .don’t know what it was.
Dr. Manhattan looks up into the sky, studying it.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Take me out of here, Jon. Please.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I’m sorry. This must be very
upsetting for you. I have traced the source of the Tachyon particles to
Antarctica. Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Anywhere. Anywhere’s better than here.</p>
<p><strong>pull out from</strong>: The televisions–NEWS REPORTS from all
over the world, documenting the tragic destruction caused by
Dr. Manhattan. Dan turns away shaken. Rorschach boils. Adrian beams.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: God. God, he</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Impersonated Dr. Manhattan. Murdered
millions of people. Call off your cat. Call off your cat and face
me!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Don’t you understand? I’ve ended the war–
I’ve ended all wars. Because of their fear of ion, I’ve forced the world
into everlasting peace.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: By committing the biggest mass murder in
history. You have no right to play God!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I wasn’t playing God. Just Dr. Manhattan.
Suddenly there’s a LOUD BEEPING in the hall. The Lynx growls. Adrian
switches the monitors to the security cameras which show ion and Laurie
materialize in the snow.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Speak of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Adrian, of course. Who else would
have the resources</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Wait, this is Adrian’s compound? Are you
saying he’s responsible for this– Jon walks toward the building,
entranced. Distracted.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and
millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I’m talking to Laurie ninety
seconds ago</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What, Daniel? Millions of others? Jon don’t
start that crap now, not here!</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s these tachyons.
They’re, muddling things up. I’d better follow him</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: In a burst, he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: No, don’t let him escape!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Jon, stop him, he killed millions of people,
who knows what else he’ll do. Jon walks calmly after Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Jon, are you okay? You seem drugged.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and
millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I’m talking to Laurie ninety
seconds ago</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What? Where’s Laurie?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s these tachyons.
They’re, muddling things up. I’d better follow him</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Jon follows Adrian into the next room.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Adrian, don’t be foolish. Even if I
can’t predict where I’m going to find you, I can turn the walls to
glass. The tachyons were clever but it’s time to give up Jon spots the
Lynx in a METAL CORRIDOR.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Very well. If I must, let us follow
this through to the bitter end. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS is
Adrian, waiting by a CONTROL PANEL. He takes one last look at his
Lynx.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Forgive me, girl. Jon enters the corridor
with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a SWITCH. The Lynx’ FUR STANDS ON END as
ENERGY CRACKLES BETWEEN THE METAL WALLS. The Lynx HOWLS.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Adrian? Adrian, don’t– LIGHT BLASTS
through Jon and the Lynx–both are OBLITERATED. Adrian peers around the
corner, winded by his success.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: You know, I really wasn’t sure that would
work.</p>
<p><strong>adrian–</strong>: Adrian turns. Laurie aims the prison
guard’s pistol at him.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’re such an asshole. Adrian cries out,
LEAPS at her as she FIRES– –and hits Adrian. He COLLAPSES. Dan and
Rorschach find them as Laurie approaches Adrian’s body</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Laurie, shoot him again! Adrian’s hand falls
from his chest to the floor, blood trickling, as his PALM OPENS–
–holding a BULLET inside.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh shit. Adrian opens his eyes and KICKS her
in the stomach, sending her flying back.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: LAURIE! If you’ve hurt her, I’ll–</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Oh Dan. Grow up. Adrian exits as Dan helps
the winded Laurie to her feet. Together, Rorschach, Dan and Laurie
follow him back to:</p>
<p><strong>disappointed.</strong>: Jon, now 100 FEET TALL, SMASHES
THROUGH THE WALL. Adrian crawls desperately away, grasping for his
remote on the floor. As Jon approaches him, Jon SHRINKS to six feet.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Restructuring myself was the first
trick I learned! It didn’t kill me before, did you seriously think it
would kill me now? You are nothing but a man. And the world’s smartest
man means no more to me than its smartest termite! Out of tricks, out of
traps, Adrian lifts the remote.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: What is that, Adrian? Some new,
ultimate weapon?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Yes. Yes, you could say that. Adrian goes
back to his wall of screens, watching the news reports. We hear SOUND
BITES and IMAGES: “India and Pakistan immediately call for truce,”
“China stands down,” “US withdraws forces,” “Israel agrees on cease
fire.” TEARS stand in Adrian’s eyes. He raises his fists in triumph.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I did it. I DID IT! I’ve saved Earth from
Hell. Next, I will elevate her to the vaulting stature of Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Next? You can’t get away with this!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: No? Will you expose me, undoing the peace so
many have just died for? Morally, you’re in checkmate, just like the
Comedian was. Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I’m afraid he’s correct. Exposing
Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: He’s right. All we did was fail to stop him
from saving Earth.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: We we can’t say anything about this</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: You’re joking, of course. Rorschach walks
toward the exit.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach, wait a second! Let’s talk this
out!</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Never. Not even in the face of
Armageddon. Never compromise. Adrian and Jon’s eyes meet–an unspoken
communication. Seeing this, Dan runs after Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Rorschach! Across the hall, ion materializes
between Rorschach and the exit.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Where are you going, Rorschach?</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America.
People must be told. Evil must be punished.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Rorschach, you know I can’t let you
do that. Rorschach pauses. Dan is halfway there . Rorschach removes his
mask, tears stand in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>rorschach</strong>: Suddenly you’ve rediscovered humanity? If
you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary. None of
this would have happened. So what are you waiting for? Do it.</p>
<p><strong>do it!!!!</strong>: Jon WAVES HIS HAND and BLOWS RORSCHACH
APART. Dan collapses to his knees, sobbing. Jon contemplates the
BURN-MARK where Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears–
–reappearing across the hall where Laurie is. She is also in tears,
watching all the horrible footage on the TV screens.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Laurie. I’m leaving this galaxy. For
one a little less complicated.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Leaving? I, I thought you regained an
interest in human life.</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: I have. I think maybe I’ll create
some. Goodbye, Laurie. He kisses her on the cheek–</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Jon, I’d hoped to talk to you. I’ve made
myself feel every death, see every innocent face I’ve murdered to save
humanity–you understand, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. manhattan</strong>: Without condoning or condemning,
I</p>
<p><strong>understand</strong>: And with that, he disappears.
Forever.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Across the hall, Dan recovers from
mourning Rorschach. He stands, gritting his teeth. Walks toward
Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: What’s on your mind, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Your death.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Really. You want to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah. You might have created peace, but not at
the expense of justice. You need to pay for what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: That doesn’t sound like you, Dan. That
sounds more like Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Exactly. Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks
away from the TV screens.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Only you’re not Rorschach, are you now? How
do you expect to succeed where he failed?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don’t. Dan FLIES
at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life. His fighting style has
changed. Dan’s newfound brutality is informed by everything he’s learned
from Rorschach. About justice. About life. But Adrian is the best. He
takes Dan’s attacks apart with ease, delivering blows which would kill a
man not quite so focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan’s final
strike and TWISTS. Dan’s arm SNAPS easily.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Dan! Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand,
Adrian blocks her attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor,
knocking her out.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dan falls to his knees, bloody and
beaten. Out of tricks, out of time, he searches his belt for something,
anything, and finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate,
he</p>
<p><strong>flicks it at adrian–</strong>: Who merely SNATCHES the
owl-Wing out of the air. He laughs. Prepares to finish Dan off.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I have to say, I’ve always thought your
choice of an owl was quite juvenile.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Really? I’ve always liked owls Adrian sees that
Dan has pulled one last item from his belt. Adrian STEPS on Dan’s WRIST,
bones crunching. Dan’s HAND falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP
REMOTE.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: because you can never hear them coming.</p>
<p><strong>behind adrian</strong>: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian
as the OWL- SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan.
Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor. Dan tries
to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered. Most of Adrian has been
CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a fine blood spray. Adrian looks over
to Dan, dying.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I . don’t regret my actions. I know in my
heart . I did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: So do I. Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and
dies.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s it. Careful. Now, pull the stick to the
left The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out more
glass.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Now, the thrusters . There. She HITS THE
THRUSTERS. The ship FLIES from the control room. It’s afterburners
IGNITING the room, and Adrian’s body.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You sure you don’t want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m okay. Thanks. We finally see Laurie
now–her hair dyed, appearance changed.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Mom–I just want to get this out of the way .
. I know Eddie Blake, the Comedian–I know he was my father. Sally
freezes.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I remember. Sally downs her drink,
immediately starts making another.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It, it was years later, he stopped by out of
the blue, and, and apologized. I don’t know, I just couldn’t stay mad.
It just happened– Laurie kisses her mother’s teary cheek.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Mom. People’s lives take them strange
places. You never did anything wrong by me. Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR
SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh that’s Dan. Home from “work.” The
bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the secret ELEVATOR.
He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed with color. Buttoning up his
shirt, he spots Sally.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh hi.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Hello, Dan. Excuse me, I should clean up.
Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom. Dan and Laurie
embrace, kiss.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Any bad guys last night?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: There are always bad guys. Even in today’s
world. Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York
skyline being rebuilt.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Will it be alright? The world, I mean. He
puts his arm around her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: As long as no-one ever finds out that Adrian
was behind it all, the public will think ion is still up there,
watching.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The threat remains, and everything should be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yeah. Just fine</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A YELLOW HAPPY FACE–suddenly SPLOTCHED
with RED– printed on A T-SHIRT now stained with ketchup.</p>
<p><strong>we pull back</strong>: And find Seymour wears the shirt,
eating a burger when the Editor bursts in.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: SEYMOUR! What the hell do you got for
me?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: We got nothing to write about. Everyone in
the country, every country in the world is holding hands now, singing
songs about peace and love–it’s like we’re living in a goddamn global
hippie commune !</p>
<p><strong>seymour</strong>: Um, I guess I can look for stuff in the
crank file.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Crank file? Whatever! Take some initiative!
Run whatever you like– Seymour turns to the PILE of submissions known as
the crank file, where RORSCHACH’S JOURNAL sits on top. Seymour
reaches–</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: –I leave it entirely in your hands. –and
picks up Rorschach’s Journal . Just as he’s about to open it, we CUT TO
BLACK.</p>
