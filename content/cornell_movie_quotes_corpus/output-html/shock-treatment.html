community anthem brought to you by our new sponsor Farley Flavors whose
new program ‘Faith Factory’ premieres on this channel tomorrow night. I,
for one, can’t wait! Now let’s turn to our regular in-depth discussion
with Judge Oliver Wright, Denton’s leading social scientist.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: In a way…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I detect a note of reticence. Are you,
perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of
presentation is overly manipulative?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Well, Betty, there are many ways that the
spider may catch the fly…</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Monetary inducements.</p>
<p><strong>neely</strong>: Hi Brad! Hi Janet! Come for the Marriage
Maze?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Seduction.</p>
<p><strong>neely</strong>: I’m exhausted working on this documentary
about Farley’s new show.</p>
<p><strong>neely</strong>: Farley Flavors! Our new sponsor. Wheeew!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Prejudice.</p>
<p><strong>neely</strong>: I tell you, Janet, that guy’s as close as
we’ll come to a successful man in this town.</p>

<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another
wonderful interview.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Judge Wright? Now, Betty? First name terms,
surely!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, Oliver, you’re so tolerant. Time for a
coffee before you rush off?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Delighted, Betty – That is if you don’t mind
being seen with an older man.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated
maturity is something I look for in a man.</p>
<p><strong>neely</strong>: Hi, Betty!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hello, Neely.</p>
<p><strong>neely</strong>: You keep up that high standard of interview
and I’ll have to include you in Farley’s documentary. You were so…
probing!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: A free thinker.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Everything’s free there.</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Stand by – Quiet please – Cue intro –
Cue Bert – three seconds –</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: And here, to bring you your just
desserts and a recipe for a perfect marriage, is that gorgeous gourmet,

<p><strong>bert</strong>: You got a good show for us tomorrow,
Ralph?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: You bet, Bert.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Good! I’m gonna be there.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Macy Struthers – God I must have been blind –
still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Isn’t that Brad and Janet Majors sitting
down front? What an ideal couple.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: More than anyone else in Denton they
represent the old values.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Eisenhower would have been proud of
them.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: So would the first couple who seem to have
made a hash of their marriage and cooked their goose step this way
please.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: That’s us.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I don’t want to get up there.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: We’ve got to, Brad, everyone’s watching.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: What’s cooking down there? Come up here and
let’s feel you!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: That’s it – Look at the camera –</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Introduce yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m Janet Majors and this is my husband
Brad.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: We’ve been hearing some bad things about you,
Brad.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: He needs help.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Face it, Janet! Brad’s an emotional
cripple.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I know, I know, it’s just…</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Looks like ‘Rest Home’ for this marriage.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Do you watch ‘Dentonvale,’ Janet?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’ve caught it once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Of course! D.T.V.’s most popular Hospital
series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley.
Neuro-specialists par excellence …if you’ll pardon my French. I
recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I know he’s boring but… Neuro-specialists!
That sounds pretty drastic.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: It’s no use pussyfooting around, Janet – we
have to cut quick and deep.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: McKinley?…McKinley?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bert brought them over from Europe. They had
a very popular series together. It’s still rerun in a lot of countries.
You must have seen them in ‘Dentonvale?’</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Never watch it.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: There’s no use delaying another moment.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I’m afraid there’s only one solution. Tell
them, Folks. One, two, three…</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: DENTONVALE!!!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Don’t go away. We’ll be right back to see if
Brad and Janet want to play or pass…</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Congratulations! I think your’re making a wise
decision.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m not going, Janet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What are you trying to do? Make Bert look
like a fool? He’s made all the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: But I don’t need treadment.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You need glasses, Brad!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m sick of being humiliated by you! Bert’s
right! You’re going!</p>

<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ve come for Mr. Majors, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Nothing serious I hope?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: No. Just a routine checkup.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Just a routine checkup, Folks!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: TELL ME, SPECTATOR WHY ARE WE ALWAYS SOONER
OR LATER BITCHIN’ IN THE KITCHEN OR CRYING IN THE BEDROOM ALL NIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: The subject is committed. As are we all.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: This week’s special guests are Brad and
Janet Majors in tonight’s episode. ‘The Arrival.’</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ah. Mr. And Mrs. Majors. How wonderful to see
you. I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague,
Nation McKinley.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: We understand you’ve been going through a
rather trying time.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Well yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Listen! There’s nothing wrong with me… It’s
just that Janet and I haven’t…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Does he do that often?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: No! He’s never done that before.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Good! Well there’s still hope. Lots of
hope.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: If anyone can help Brad. We can.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Well, he needs help.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ah. Nurse Ansalong - you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>ansalong</strong>: Well it was pretty short notice but I…</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: ATTEND to Mr. Majors, Nurse.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: There are just one or two formalities that have
to be dealt with, Mrs. Majors. There are contracts to be signed…</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Could I do that later?</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ansalong</strong>: Sign the contract tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Just one or two details. Does he have any
living relatives? Blood relatives?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: No…couldn’t I do this later?</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Why did you tell me not to sign now?</p>
<p><strong>ansalong</strong>: Well this way, you get the first day
free.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: About Brad’s family?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: As Janet’s parents this should be really easy.
Your last clue… Mental Instability. You have thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Mental instability?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He was adopted you know.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’d forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well I hadn’t. I was worried about inherited
craziness when they married. I said to Janet ‘What do we know of his
parents?’</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Which leads us to…?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Infantile regression?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You got it!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I got it! I got it!!!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Congratulations! It’s ‘Happy Homes’ for Harry
and Emily Weiss of Denton.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: IF ONLY YOU KNEW HOW TO WIN SOME PRIZES IF
ONLY YOU KNEW – HOW TO PLAY IF YOU COULD SLEEP NIGHTS AND STOP YOUR
CRYING YOU MIGHT FIND OUT I STILL LOVE YOU IN MY OWN WAY</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: IF THAT’S NOT ENOUGH THEN I’M SO SORRY I MET
YOU IT WAS ALMOST LIKE LEADING YOU ON BUT THERE’S MORE TO IT ALL THEN
JUST WRINGING YOUR HEART OUT OVER SOMEETHING THAT KEEPS ON GOING WRONG
SO DON’T TELL ME YOU LOVE ME HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: NO DON’T SELL EMOTION YOU CAN’T BUY DEVOTION
WHEN YOU’RE FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I HOPE THAT YOU’LL SMILE WHEN YOU REACH YOUR
CONCLUSION I HOPE THAT YOU’LL KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY BUT IF IT SHOULD
MEAN THAT THE PARTY IS OVER YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I STILL LVOE YOU YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT I STLL LOVE YOU IN MY OWN WAY</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh my poor baby.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh. Mom. It’s Brad.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I know baby. He’s going to get all the help he
needs but in the meantime – Look!!! For you.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: They call it a new look at an old favourite I
copied it from the ‘Window on the World’ show. The Far East meets the
Mid-West!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: It’s…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Just what the Doctor ordered. I know. Come on
in, my favourite show’s just started.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What show?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: ‘Dentonvale.’</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Infantile regression.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You got it!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I got it! I got it!!!</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Our speciality.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I can’t wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I
don’t know what we’d do without you!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well I confess the decision to have Brad
committed was not strictly my own.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Of course, Mrs. Majors – Janet – But I’m
puzzled. If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn’t she
sign the contract?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No it wasn’t Janet – exactly – It was, in
fact, your new sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: SPONSOR!!!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Dentonvale has been sold.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: SOLD??!!</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Dear old Bert’s settled everything.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Jah – you endorse his product – He endorses
your research.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: HE!!?? How dare this person take advantage of
my weakness.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: I don’t think he intends to go that far.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Poor Brad.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have
killed his parents.</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: ‘THANK GOODNESS’</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: And thank goodness he hasn’t ended up like the
Slepstrini boy.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is
a chip off the old block. I played 18 holes of golf with his father just
last week. And Hank says Danny’s moved to New York. To better
himself.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He moved all right! When they found him with
fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson’s Bakery.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Mexicans.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m going to catch up on a few jobs that need
doing outside.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You shouldn’t have said that.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Your father doesn’t like Mexicans.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: A MAN SHOULD CALL THE TOSS…WEAR THE PANTS AND
BE THE BOSS A MAN SHOULD BE THE DRAKE FOR HIS OWN DAMNED SAKE… AND MEN
SHOULD BE THE MISTERS AND MASTERS OF THEIR SISTERS AND MEN SHOULD BE THE
REASON FOR A HEART TO BREAK</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: A MAN SHOULD CUT THE LAWN…CHANGE A TYRE… MEND
THE WORN A MAN SHOULD NEVER WAIT TO OIL A RUSTING GATE MEN SHOULD HOLD
THE KEY POSITIONS IN OUR COUNTRY’S GREAT TRADITIONS A MAN SHOULD PUT THE
FOOD UPON THE FAMILY PLATE.</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: SO BE MORAL DON’T QUARREL FAIR AND SQUARE
IS BEST</p>
<p><strong>wives</strong>: LET ME ALERT YOU THAT VIRTUE WON’T HURT YOU
OR DESERT YOU</p>
<p><strong>rednecks</strong>: IF YOU WEAR HAIR ON YOUR CHEST.</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: SO ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FOLLOW THE RULES</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: BOX CLEVER</p>
<p><strong>rednecks</strong>: AND JOCKS NEVER</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Hock another jock’s tools…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: A MAN SHOULD WAX A CAR…FIX A FUSE AND TEND A

<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself
committed?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m sorry, Officer.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Vance! Vance Parker.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Janet. Janet Majors. It’s just that Brad…my
husband…is not… very well and… I don’t want to miss the next episode of
Dentonvale.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Dentonvale…say, that’s for… I’m sorry to
hear that, Janet. Look I’m going to let you through, but keep it to
yourself, otherwise…</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Thanks Officer Park…Vance.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Don’t worry, Janet. Brad’ll probably get
just what he needs.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Conspiracy? That sounds a little
farfetched.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It’s happened before. Remember Lieutenant
Orpheus? He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came
back.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sounds like my husband. He never came back
either. At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Ah yes. Farley Flavors. You know, I find
it…</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: …remarkable that his ‘Faith Factory’ is
being financed by an entire nation’s indigestion.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Oh. Ah, I’m not calling at an inconvenient
moment am I?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not at all. You have your life. And I have
mine.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Yeah, well. Here, Betty. I just came to give
you this.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I better get going. Tomorrow’s the big one,
and, well, Farley expects!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I’ll leave you young things to it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Shove it, Ralph!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: You too, Betty!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Alimony is just another word for rape!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier
is…</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: …closed?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: What a meal! I insist on the recipe.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Coming from a gourmet that’s praise indeed.
But. No secrets!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: With Fast Food Farley at the helm it’ll be TV
dinners from now on.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.
Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental
hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Our field.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What does he know about it?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Who do you think gave you the next
episode?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: So that Janet would be free to front line his
‘Faith Factory.’</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We’re the experts.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Who trusts experts?</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: How did you come by this scenario?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I am in Farley’s employ – and… …we’re
discussing a network deal.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Why Janet?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Everyone loves the girl next door,
particularly Farley.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: So it seems.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Tonight’s episode. ’Janet’s Dilemma”</p>
<p><strong>mac and nation</strong>: Janet!!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’ve come to see Brad.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: That’s out of the question, he’s sleeping
like a baby.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s you we’re concerned about, Janet.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Yes how are you, Janet? Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m…happy.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: There are countless people in this world who
believe they’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: But they only think they’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: That doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: This might, Janet.</p>

<p><strong>nation</strong>: I love home movies, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>farley</strong>: TIME IS TIGHT JANET DO IT RIGHT JANET UNTIL
TOMORROW NIGHT, JANET.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I won’t be a party to this. I want to see
Brad.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: The question is, does Brad want to see you?
Quite frankly, he hates you.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards
you.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s classical. Almost a textbook case…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That’s an extremely negative response.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Is it because I’m becoming too popular?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings
soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: So you see, Janet, you can help us to help
him.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.
We’ll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Now Betty, don’t overreact.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Overreact! You’re the one with theories about
conspirac… Oliver?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Yes, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Are you spoken for this evening?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Right! An early start with Janet’s debut on
‘Good Morning Denton.’ By the time we unveil Farley’s ‘Faith Factory’ we
will have earned our beauty sleep.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Can I just ‘peep in’ on Brad before I go
home?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Home?</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: This is the nerve center of operations,
Janet. You must stay here tonight. That way we can all be here when
Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And you can ‘peep in’ on Brad in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Are all the beds made up?</p>
<p><strong>ansalong</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Then have Ricky lock up for the night.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It pays to know your way around, Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: A ‘stately pleasure home’ indeed.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor. As a matter of
fact…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: ‘IT IS AN ANCIENT MARINER AND HE STOPPETH ONE
OF THREE BY THE LONG GREY BEARD AND GLITTEREING EYE NOW WHEREFORE
STOPP’ST THOU ME’</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE

<p><strong>betty</strong>: ‘…HE WENT LIKE ONE THAT HATH BEEN STUNNED AND
IS OF SENSE FORLORN. A SADDER AND A WISER MAN HE ROSE THE ’MORROW
MORN.’</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Does this belong to you?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: When do I get to see Brad?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: After breakfast. You’re sounding tense, Janet.
Maybe I could give you a little massage?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: In my time they used to call me the Merlin of
Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: They probably meant Irving and wanted you to
swing.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: Mac’s waiting in wardrobe, Janet. Nice to
see you up and about, Bert. Care to join me in an on-set snack?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I want to see Brad.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I understand your concern, but I feel it’s time
you started thinking of yourself. Look at yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: More beautiful than any film star. And I should
know. In the old series they came and went in every episode.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Is it true they’re all midgets with big
heads?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you
are perfection, flawless beauty.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You are the most desirable creature that ever
walked.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: If only Brad could have found it within his
heart to say these things to me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: He will. But it’s up to you to reawaken his
feelings. You’ve got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.
And Farley’s given you that chance. You can use the Breakfast Show to
knock Denton dead.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Do you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’ve got a really tight team around you. And
everybody needs you!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: But what’ll I do? What’ll I say? What’ll I
wear?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS
ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT’S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE’S

Betty Hapschatt is… indisposed. So Macy will have to do the links.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I don’t need linking.</p>

spoil the line.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: HGMMMPHH!!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: My God, Janet! How can you say such things?
Look at Brad, look what they’ve done to him?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ahhh!</p>

<p><strong>janet</strong>: . . .For his own good.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Of course. He was in great danger of harming
himself.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: We only want what’s best for him, as parents
you must understand.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: No. No, I don’t. He doesn’t have to be trussed
up like a turkey. There are drugs that can keep him quiet.</p>
<p><strong>nation</strong>: We used them. All of them.</p>

kill to do it. I’ll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don’t

be introducing a new look that will show off one or two old faces in an
entirely new light.</p>
<p><strong>neely</strong>: Really! Sounds promising.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Yes, Betty. But the false promise of a new
dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, Oliver. What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: No! I don’t know what Janet’s next move will
be…but you can be sure of one thing…it all starts here!</p>
