<p><strong>guard</strong>: It’s coming up… Slow down… There, right
there…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Benny, God, take it easy…</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I don’t want to scare them away.</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: Smells smoke…</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: There!! Up on the hill!!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Right in line with that burning tree.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: It’s there. The fog’s thicker now, but it’s
there. What do you think started those fires?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Benny, there’s nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: There is. They came out of the belly of the
ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the
houses.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Flew?! Oh, come on Benny…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: You hear that, Mike? Now he’s telling
us…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Probably kids.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Probably…</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Don’t you think you should call a backup?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No, we can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: This is the police. Identify
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: There’s one over here…</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Stop!! Police!!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I think I shot one.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: You see anything, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: This is the police. Identify
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You wanna give me some help over here.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Benny, this is me. I’m going to take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Don’t leave me. I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>subtitle</strong>: Lander four to Mapmaker Wind. Fix position
for rescue. Repeat. Fix position for rescue.</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: What the hell was it anyway?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Damned if I know.</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: Come on. I’m getting wet.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: It musta been a bird.</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: How about if I drive now?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Major Aaron Bell…</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Marc Shermin, National Security Agency.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: This has always been my favorite time of
day.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Very beautiful country up here…</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Any signs of biological contamination,
excessive radiation, anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Not on the landscape. We’re trying to
get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly
lifeforms but it’s hard going.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Can you see under the faceplate?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: There’s a good chance you could be wrong
about this thing then…</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Wait’ll you see it.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: We had a flight of F16’s play tag with
the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and
disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Was there visual contact?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: No, sir. Radar.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: It could have been anything.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: After I called in, I had a chance to sit
down with the three locals. They swear there’s another one that didn’t
make the ship… It might be alive.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: People have made mistakes in these
situations before.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: I’ve been investigating sightings for
seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one’s real. We have a dead extra-
terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be
alive. We’ve been visited. It’s finally happened and the sooner
Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we’re going to deal
with these beings, the better off we’re going to be.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Look at the hands.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: We better get it into the box. Come
on…</p>
<p><strong>subtitle</strong>: Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: The other one is alive!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Is it for real?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Get Fox.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: It’s real, George.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: There’s no mistake? You’re absolutely sure?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I saw it with my own eyes. We’ve killed an
extraterrestrial and…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Is there any possibility that it’s a hoax?
Could you be mistaken?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: None. And there’s another one in the area
that’s alive. I don’t know if it’s the only one. I don’t know if it was
left here by accident or it’s part of an inva…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air
Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They’ll take it from
there… We didn’t expect this, Shermin.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Neither did I.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’re going… Damn! We’ll tell the press that
there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be
violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell
these people that we’re friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake.
Is anyone trying to contact the ship?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking
for the one on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: We’ll need a lot of help, George. You could
hide an army up here.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m going to the White House right now. I’ll
try and get you everything you need.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Wait, wait… What are my orders if we find
this thing?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Contain it and get back to me.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: What do you mean by ‘contain?’</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Just what I said.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: It was great to have you back… The kids
loved it. We loved it. You’re doing the right thing…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I hope so… We’ll see… See you tomorrow… Bye.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Remember you’re required to have a lesson
planned tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Iron channel message. Suit and rockets
destroyed. Radical mixture of this atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed
chemo-ion response time to adapt my body to this air. Am going to
attempt extreme transformation in order to cross land mass to site of
our practice landings. If transformation is not fatal, second message
ball by next darkness.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Aghh… I’m supposed to umpire a little
league game tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about it… There might not be
any little league tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: I’m telling you they’re probably
friendly.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Then why did they try and sneak in the back
door? Tell me that. Why didn’t they contact us first and say…</p>
<p><strong>radar technician</strong>: UFO coming out of the grass.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Lock in.</p>
<p><strong>radar technician</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: This is crazy. What were we going to do if
that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three
M16’s and some handguns.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Give it a rest, Lyman.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: I’ve never once heard of anybody being
hurt by an extraterrestrial…</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: That’s because the ones that were hurt, died.
They couldn’t talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Any reports about monsters, people in
Halloween masks, anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: No, but there sure were a lot of people
who saw lights in the sky last night. Reports are still coming in.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: I’ve heard of blood being drawn,
sometimes they were taken for a ride in the ship, a lot of times they
said they had sex… But nobody was ever hurt…</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: But you decided those weren’t real. This one
is.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Fox.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ve got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Recognize this?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: It’s a copy of the plaque NASA sent into
space on the Pioneer probes.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Houston found it in the extraterrestrial’s
suit.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: They must have picked it up in
space.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Then it’s not an accident that they found
us.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We don’t think that’s necessarily bad. At least
it’s a point of contact.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were
here why didn’t they let us know they were coming?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’ll get those answers when you find the one
you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: That’s not going to happen, George, unless
you get us the help you promised us.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’ve been back and forth on this all day and
keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general
public, it’s been decided not to expand the search at this time.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Don’t let them do it this way, George. It’s
too important. We can’t find this thing alone.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You have to. We’re trying to contact the ship.
If we do, I’ll let you know immediately. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>radar technician</strong>: You get the feeling we’re
expendable?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: We always were.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Wehave… Wehave… Wehave…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Wehave…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Wehave…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Please don’t hurt me… please… please.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s got to be here… it’s got to be here…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No… please don’t…</p>
<p><strong>dr. bergen</strong>: The creature was hit three times…</p>
<p><strong>dr. bergen</strong>: …the arm, the abdomen and the upper
chest, the one in the chest being the cause of death. It shattered, for
want of a better term, the creature’s backbone. It’s not really, because
it’s not jointed. It’s simply a hollow shaft of very pliable silicate
material, as is its entire endoskeleton. The creature seems to have
tremendous regenerative powers. Although it must have died within
minutes of receiving the fatal wound, the arm and abdomen wounds are
almost totally healed and the bullet here… has begun to dissolve…</p>
<p><strong>dr. bergen</strong>: It has veins but no blood. We think, and
this is just speculation, that some form of energy flows from the brain,
which is much more sophisticated than ours, throughout the rest of the
body… We don’t think there is any danger of bacterial contamination. Our
biochemistries are too different…</p>
<p><strong>dr. bergen</strong>: The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is
very porous and very moist. This is another guess, but it probably comes
from a planet that receives only reflected light, perhaps from a ring of
moons. Its atmospheric pressure is slightly less than ours and it
contains a great deal more water…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in Washington. Can
you give us an idea of why they’re here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bergen</strong>: They’re so advanced… I… eh… can’t
imagine what they would want from us. I know they could be dangerous.
But they could also be the greatest thing that ever happened to
mankind…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t… don’t do this… please…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re hurting me. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, God, no! I’m not leaving this house with
you. You’re going to hurt me, I know…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can’t. I’d like to help. You look like
Scott, but I know you’re not. I don’t know what you are. You gotta
understand, I’m afraid of you…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Why are you doing this to me? I’ll give you
whatever…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Which way do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You can go that way… That way… That way…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: God, what are you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That green dot, that’s us, isn’t it… and the
red’s where you want to go?… You don’t understand me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I gotta get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: wheel is called</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Ah… no…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Ah no.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Steering wheel…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Gear shift.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Gear shift.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Eh… police.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Police…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What?…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Steering wheel… What?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: correctly at each</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Coupons.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You stupid son of a bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Help me!!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You could have killed us both!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: her grip on the door</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Jesus Christ!! You crazy people…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Call the police!!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey buddy… let her go…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Help me!!!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, she doesn’t want to go with you. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh God, man… don’t shoot me… My mistake… I’m
sorry…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He doesn’t understand… just walk away…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I promise I’m not going to tell anybody about
this… None of my business… I’m going to move now, okay… You guys want to
fight, that’s up to you… I’m leaving now… I won’t say a word…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Could you put the gun down?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Gun… Down… Down.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: There’s nothing… No reports of sightings or
landings or anything… in the other parts of the country or overseas…
Seems like a totally isolated incident.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: It was only an accident that we
discovered them.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I know, but…</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You married, Major?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Twenty-eight years.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: To the same woman?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I tried it once… Fourteen years ago… ’I was
a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I’m good at is this…
At least until yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: How would you describe the sounds we heard
coming out of that thing’s helmet?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: It was kind of like clicking, maybe a
language wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in
Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper
threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange ‘clicking
gibberish’…</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: It was a man though… right?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: The police think he was high on drugs…</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Nothing up there… The grass is matted
down in a few places, but that could have been anything.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: It was the husband. The police finally got
a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: It’s the right area, that’s for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Why the clicking language though?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there’s been
some trouble next door. I’d like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: There’s a possibility that Mrs. Haydn’s
been kidnapped. We’re hoping you might have seen something.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I told you…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Judy, that’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, maybe these men won’t think so. We were
asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into
the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and
there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling
Jenny down the walk to the car.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You know that’s impossible!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know what I saw. I’ve seen him enough
times.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: wife and addressing</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: R-r-S-s…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: T-t-U…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: u-V-v…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Cow… Dog… Pig…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: W-w…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s so funny about X?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: George, we’ve just confirmed the existence
of the live extraterrestrial.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: When can we expect containment?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Well, we’re in pursuit of a green
Mustang…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It’s in a green Mustang?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Yes. It’s kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and
from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>military man</strong>: This one has a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: No, no… A .45, it probably got it in the
woman’s house. They were last seen in downtown Eau Claire…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Why did you let it get into a populated
area?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: It’s taken on a disguise.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Clarify that.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: It’s made itself look like the woman’s dead
husband.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Repeat the last item.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: The extraterrestrial now looks like
this.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Oh shit!!!</p>

<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Minneapolis.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: leg pouch he took from his
life-support</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: …What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Minneapolis… good.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re full of tricks, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We need gas.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No gas.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No gas.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This car runs on gas.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Gas…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No gas.</p>
<p>****: Gas.</p>
<p>****: No gas.</p>
<p>****: Gas.</p>
<p>****: No gas.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No gas… car dead. We need gas. I don’t want
to get shot for running out of gas.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Gas good?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Gas…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s closed… closed. We need one that’s
open.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Closed?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Not what. Who. What is for things. What?
What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he? Who is she? Who are

<p>****: Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am
I? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I am Jenny Haydn.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhaydn.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I am…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s a big help. Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: From?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: points through the windshield at the</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Space?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Up there… I… eh… can’t explain… But that’s
the only place you could be from.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Gas.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Closed.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No gas.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My… husband.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I am husband?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No. I don’t know what you are, but you’re not
Scott.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Shit?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, no… don’t say that. Bad word.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Shit… shit… what shit?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You’re worse than a
parrot!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Mouth closed… closed.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I see it.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Attendant. He’ll give us gas. Put the gun
down. Under the seat. Under the seat…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh God! You’re going to get us both killed.
Okay… in your pocket…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: In your pocket… pocket…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: In your pocket, please…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You. Mouth closed.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Morning, folks. Fill her up?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: …Gas…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m going to the ladies’ room. You stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Go back to the car.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: See. It’s a bathroom. I’m not trying to
escape. I just have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Satisfied? Now get out. Out.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Women… me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Men. You go in here.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Do I need a key for the head?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Fill it up.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Howdy… can’t get her out.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Gas.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: I know how she feels.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s still a toilet. Hasn’t become a
ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Kid-nap-ped… go-ing W o-n…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Candy.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Money… candy.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: That’ll be fifteen fifty, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What is… …Coke?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: A drink.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You want to try it?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I want to try it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This stuff could kill… Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Eh… you keep it. I’ve had enough.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What is kidnapped?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Kidnapped!!!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Kidnapped!!! What is kidnapped?!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Kidnapped is what you’re doing to me now!!!
Kidnapped is pointing a gun at me and taking me from my house! Kidnapped
is changing yourself into my husband. I don’t know what you are and I
don’t care. I just want to get away from you!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhaydn.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I am good.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Horses.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Horses.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Music.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Iron channel message. Transmute was
successful. Have captured one of them. It is taking me to the pick-up
point in a land vehicle. I think I can control it by mastering its
language, which is primitive and easy to learn. Will arrive on time.
Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I just came from a meeting with the Security
Council and in view of the extraterrestrial’s radical change and the
fact that all our efforts to contact its ship remain unanswered, it was
decided to issue a ten state ‘all points bulletin’ for Scott Haydn,
Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang. The officers have been instructed not
to approach the people or the vehicle but to contact you. You will then
move in and contain the subjects.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You sure you want this, because… that’s
putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m afraid the situation demands that kind of
risk.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I don’t like it, George…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for
help. What’s changed?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: It’s messy… the thing’s got a gun… We’re
just asking for somebody to get killed…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We don’t know what else to do. We need
results.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You’ll get results one way or the other,
that’s for sure… Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m gonna be here if you need anything.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: They’re gonna let some local cop blow
him away.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Save us all a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: Jesus Lyman, you’re an ignorant
fool.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: You have no conception of this, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and
light and goodness you think’ll come out of this. You know what’s gonna
come out of this… The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end
of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these
things. Don’t you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Are you ladies through?…</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Good… It looks like we might be the
welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we’re
gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Bell wants us to get down on our knees and
bow.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Did your people have any contingencies
rehearsed?</p>
<p><strong>major bell</strong>: No… I guess we never thought it would
happen.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Red light!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stop!!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That was a red light!! I told you you have to
stop at a red light!!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: It was yellow.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You didn’t even see it.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I will see it next time.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You better.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: dot on the satel</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: My… …car will take me… …up there…
home.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: When do you have to be here?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I do not understand.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How will I do this one?…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Sun…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Sun… day. No sun… night. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Yes. Day… night.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How many days and nights do you have to go…
…here?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Three nights… two days.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s not much time. I’ll just slow you
down. I have to sleep. I’m very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You
don’t…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I need you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I won’t tell anybody if that’s what you’re
worried about. I promise. You’ll keep…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’ll keep the car. I’ll take a bus… Am I
going up there with you… in your ship… up there?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Then let me go. You don’t need me.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I feel like I’m going crazy here. You’re
Scott. But he’s dead. I don’t know what’s real anymore. I can’t be here
with you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Do you understand what I’m saying to you? You
can keep the car. That should be enough for gas from here to there.
Please let me go.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: When we get here.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You bastard.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhaydn!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Hey!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My baby!!! He’s stealing my baby! Burt!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was stealing
my baby!!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Where you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He was trying to steal Gloria.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Is that right? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Is that right? Come on. Answer me.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Were you trying to steal my baby? Huh? Answer
me!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhaydn!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhaydn!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stop it!!! Stop it!!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Get away from him!! Leave him alone!! You
stupid jerks!! He’s retarded!! Can’t you see that?!! Get away from
him!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He was stealing my baby…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re wrong!! He would never do anything
like that!! Let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He had Gloria in his hands!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He’s retarded! I shouldn’t have left him
alone!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Gate three. It’s boarding now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Have a nice trip.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop
Wells…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Is that a baby?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: A baby is a new person?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Eh… yes…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Do you have a baby?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No… The closest…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’d love to have a baby. But I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can’t… Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I
was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You’ll have to hitchhike the rest
of the way.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: But I must go here.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know that. But the buses don’t go
there.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What is hitchhike?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s easy. I’ll explain that in a minute.
This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take
this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the
driver. ‘Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.’</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Say it.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: ‘Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak
English.’</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The driver will…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: But I speak English.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Will you please do it my way? You’ll get into
trouble if you don’t. If anybody talks to you, tell them… I do not speak
English.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I do not speak English.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on
the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take… …this part.
When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, ‘Las Vegas, please’…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: ‘Las Vegas, please. I do not speak
English.’ What is hitchhike?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You want this ticket?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Then don’t be smart.</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion,
Sioux City and Omaha… loading at Gate 3.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s your bus. When you get to Las Vegas,
ask the driver. ‘Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.’</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: ‘Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak
English.’</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike… You
stand on the side of the road, the highway… you understand? And you face
the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a
truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Your thumb tells the driver that you want a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: The car will stop?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Not every car, but… a car will stop… Maybe
not the first car… maybe number eight, number fifteen…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: When do I get to Lathrop Wells?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right
away and…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: …you’ll have plenty of time to get to where
you want to go.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t worry. They’re not going to hurt you.
Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don’t lose
it.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Can I have the gun?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You might need this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t be afraid. Do what I told you and
you’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well… I’m going to go now.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Go?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me…
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhaydn.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Please stay.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ll stay till you get on the bus.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Ticket?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: See? You’re going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s a kiss… Goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I was afraid.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, you win. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: This kind of thing’s real bad for
business…</p>
<p><strong>tough</strong>: He couldn’t even speak English.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Those kind of people should be shot.</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I think he was just lost…</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Who’s side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>tough</strong>: No way he was going to get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Where’s that?… And it was one person, one
way…</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get
two of them together. You got three stories. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Is there a reward in this?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Huh?… Eh… no, there isn’t</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Because I’m the one who called the
police, you know.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Hey, it’s none of my business why
you’re chasing a retard… You want my opinion, it’s the girl. She had to
hold the guy’s hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You saw that?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Hey… he didn’t look like no big time
criminal to me.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Eh… the store tells you to call when
there’s trouble, so they won’t get sued… But that shouldn’t matter if
there’s a reward, right?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I wouldn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: That’s what I thought. So remember
it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: We will. Something’s wrong here. She’s
helping him now.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop
Wells and put him on the bus. He didn’t stay on though and they drove
off together.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: Maybe he’s turned her into one of them. They
enter the crowd around the helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Why did your ship land on this planet… on
Earth?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: It was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You thought we were a different planet?!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No. My ship was doing a map of all the
suns and…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stars… When a sun is far away, we call it a
‘star.’</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: We were doing a map of the stars and all
the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My… eh… we kidnapped
it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very
important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the
stars.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You did? That’s funny. So did we.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: We told our home, and the people who tell
us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to
land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and… the driver
of my ship…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The captain…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: The captain wanted to land to see close
and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot
at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, that’s terrible. I’m sorry. Was he a good
friend?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I don’t understand ‘friend.’</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: A friend is a person that is good to you…
someone you like to be with… someone you like to laugh with…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: He was a good friend… The captain took the
ship away fast and I was not in the ship.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The police shouldn’t have started shooting.
But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn’t know you
were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt
us.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Sounds like your captain’s going to get hell
when he gets back home.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What is hell?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: He will.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Are you my friend?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I am your friend.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: God is your creator. God is your master.
God is you savior. God is the only reason that you exist. If God…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Who is God?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Nobody knows.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I like this music.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ve noticed… Do you understand what they’re
saying?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Not all… but it feels like a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Do you have music up there?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’d like to hear it. Can you sing
something?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I do not want to.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t be afraid… I’d really like to hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I am not a good singer.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You liked my singing?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes. Sing some more.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What can I do for you folks?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How much are your rooms?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine
fifty for two.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You have one with two beds?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit
card?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Credit card.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’ll have to run your card off now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’re only going to be here a few hours…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: It’s still the full price.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jenny, look…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Put that back.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: But I have never seen this before. I am
not complete.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Put it back.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You can park your car in front of the
room.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What did these two do?</p>
<p><strong>second driver</strong>: All anybody knows is that they’re
armed and dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: Be a piece of cake for us to take
’em.</p>
<p><strong>third driver</strong>: National Security folks should be here
any minute. Let them take care of it. That’s what they get the big bucks
for.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I want a drink. May I have two
quarters?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You shouldn’t drink so much of that stuff.
It’s bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: On the radio they say it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: with a drink can in</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You can have one.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m not sleepy anymore. Let’s drive for a
little while longer.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Are you angry at me?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No. I’m just not tired. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>second driver</strong>: onto the frontage</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No!!! No!!!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: He’s got a gun!!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhaydn! Jennyhaydn!!</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: One of them must be pretty badly hurt.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Get this back to the copter.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don’t want
to hurt you or your friend. Please put down your weapon and come
out.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Okay, fan out. These people have a gun but
we want them alive. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>third driver</strong>: Over here! They’re over here!</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Mrs. Haydn, we don’t want to hurt you. Put
down your gun and come out. We just want to talk to your friend.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Iron channel message. Almost caught by
pursuers. This may hinder escape. Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Don’t forget to tell the boys where you had a
good time.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You weren’t that good.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Tell him I’m not here.</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Get me a radio. At least I won’t have to
look at his face.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’re growing very concerned back here. There’s
no use pretending otherwise. We’re rapidly approaching a ‘condition
red.’ People are beginning to ask difficult questions.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I’ll make this as simple as I can, George.
They disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I don’t care where you’re from you just can’t
disappear into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: George, listen to what you’re saying. This
thing’s changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a
deal.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: So far you’ve let it cross the heart of
America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is
detrimental to our security. I don’t see the humor in that.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Maybe… look, this is just something to
think about… from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared
than anything else… I don’t feel it’s as big a threat as you think it
is…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Is that what’s affecting your performance?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I’m not being unpatriotic, and I’m doing my
damndest to catch them. Bell’s up on 80 and I’m down here on 70 past
Grand Junction. They’re heading west. If they’re not flying we have a
damn good chance of getting them. All I’m asking is that you people
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You just do your job, Shermin. We’ll make the
policy.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hello… hello.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hello. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Jennyhay…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: …nd. You are all fixed. I’m sorry you were
shot. I was a big problem for you. Thank you for your help. I can go to
my ship alone now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where did you stop last?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where did you stop last?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Stay right there…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What was your last stop?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Elmo’s…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: About five miles back.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Are there any more in there?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Las Vegas, please. I do not speak
English.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hop in.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I can only take you to Grand Junction, but
you’ll have a better chance to get a ride from there.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Parlez vous Francais?… Habla Ingles?… Sprechen
zie deutsch?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a
living?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m a cook. Do you understand ‘cook?’</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook.
That’s how I make money.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I make maps.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Eh… yes.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Make any money?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: You don’t get rich as a cook, either, believe
me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to
nursing to help pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Smoke?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: She wants to become a doctor. She’s a bright
kid. Hard worker. I think she’ll make it. But the damned inflation’s
driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like
ours.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: I got two other kids. I don’t know what we’ll
do when they get old enough for college.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. That
might be where it starts. But I think a lot of people are just using
that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off. I see it every day in the
kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon cans. The price has gone up three
times in the last year. And now the cans are only half full.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Do you have children?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: They’re damned expensive and a pain in the ass
sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade having them for anything.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: What do you think of America?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: It is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m looking for a guy about this tall, with
brown hair and really gray eyes…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt and a
baseball cap… probably hitchhiking.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: I don’t pay much attention to those
guys.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: In the last hour or so…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This is him.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: I don’t know… I’m not sure. I
might have seen him up the road a piece on my way in. He’s long gone by
now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You know if anybody here’s going to
Wisconsin?</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: Ask inside.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Anybody going to…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Anybody going to Wisconsin?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I need a ride.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: I’m going to Des Moines. If you can wait
till I finish here, you’re welcome to ride along.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can wait.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where’s the phone?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Operator… may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Could you give me the highway patrol,
please?</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Sergeant Packert, Highway Patrol.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My name’s Jenny Haydn. I think you’re looking
for me. I was kidnapped in Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of days ago.
But I’m free now.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What was your name again?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Jenny Haydn. I’m on my way home and I don’t
want anybody I’m with shot at when you…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You trace it yet?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: All we know right now is that it’s east
of here.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: This is Marc Shermin. Where are you,
Mrs. Haydn?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t know. Someplace called Elmo’s. Look,
I just wanted to tell you that I’m all right and I’m on my way home.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You’ve been through quite an ordeal,
Mrs. Haydn. Why don’t you stay where you are and let us pick you up?
We’ll fly you home.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No. You’ll want to ask a lot of questions I
don’t want to answer right now. I already have a ride.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I only called to tell you I was free and not
to shoot anybody I was with if you see me.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Is the man who kidnapped you there now?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I told you. He let me go. I’m on my way
home.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Get a highway patrol unit over there.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Mrs. Haydn, I’m going to have to ask you to
stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Mr… I’m sorry, what was your name again?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Marc Shermin.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Mr. Shermin, I’m hanging up now. If you want
to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I’m in the
book.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Do you know what you were kidnapped by?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Mrs. Haydn…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He doesn’t want to hurt anybody. Please leave
him alone.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: What’s he planning to do in Lathrop Wells?
Is he meeting someone there?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I changed my mind. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s me again…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I need a fast ride west.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You sure this is your car?</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: My grandmother’s rich.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Slow down, slow down.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I told you I’m looking for someone.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: In the cars, too?!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: This is going to be a real drag. I thought
you wanted to go fast.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: They after you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What? No, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Would be kinda neat if they were. I think
I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Well, here we are… You go down that ramp
there, you’re sure to get a ride.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: And don’t be shy about your English. You speak
better than a lot of people I know. Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Flash for all you good buddies heading west
on 70. Smoky’s got a roadblock just beyond Grand Junction… Better dump
your dope, they’re going through everything… He’s right. I was just
there and I’m still sore…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Ah loves to be frisked! What are they
looking for? I’m holding. Any way around it? Where are you? Oh no!!
There it is!!</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: I bet you we find your friend at the
roadblock.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We better find him before that.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: The girl’s not here, Mr. Shermin. Seems
right after she talked to you, she got a ride west with a kid.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You get that, Lyman?</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: We’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>long hair</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Las Vegas, please.</p>
<p><strong>long hair</strong>: We’re going to L.A.</p>
<p><strong>long hair</strong>: Sure. Get in. We can drop you in Vegas or
get you darn close.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: I’m telling you, you’re going to find him
at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: If he didn’t want to go through the
roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Fly.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: The five-fifty. We already passed it. But
it’ll take him way out of his way.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Pull over. I’ve got to get back there.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Why wouldn’t he want to go through the
roadblock?… What did you guys do?… I won’t tell anybody.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s easier not to tell if you don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Wait. Could I have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: I have nothing to do. I’d like to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I told you goodbye. Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The police are waiting for you up ahead.
There’s a roadblock. You have to go back.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: This car will take me to Las Vegas. I
cannot go back.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have
to go another way. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: If I don’t meet the ship, my people will
go home without me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Please understand. If you go this way, you’ll
never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to
go another way. I’ll get you to your ship. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I will go. But not you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You shit! I’ll decide if I go or not. Not
you. I don’t know what you do on your planet, but I didn’t think that
was very nice walking out on me like you did.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I don’t want you to be hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I didn’t ask to come along on this trip, but
I sure as hell am going to be the one to say when I get off.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Any sign of either of them yet?</p>
<p><strong>lyman</strong>: I don’t think they’re going to show.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Okay. Tell the highway patrol to block all
major arteries off 70 from here to Elmo’s.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: The Cook said I speak good English.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I must meet my ship.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Why can’t we wait here for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I feel better if I move.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’re hundreds of miles from where you have
to be.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Even if we walk five miles, it’s not going to
make any difference.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Asshole!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where did you learn that?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: The cook.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’re not going to get a ride tonight.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I can’t stay on this planet.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No one’s traveling in this weather.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You promised you would get me to my
ship.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I will. I will. We still have another
day.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You promised.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What do you want from me? There are no cars
on this road. I didn’t ask for this stupid storm.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You can stop. I will go on alone.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’re too far away to walk. Don’t you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I can’t stay here. I want to go home. I
don’t want this skin. I don’t want to look like this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Why don’t you send one of your radio balloons
and tell your captain that you might be late?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I used the last one to jump off the
cliff…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Let’s find a place out of the rain. I’m sure
we’ll get a ride in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I can’t be late. I don’t know if the radio
balloons work above your planet. I don’t know if my words went to the
ship. If I’m not there, the captain will think I’m dead and go.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’ll get a ride in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Can you close the door?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You are cold.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re damn right I am.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I do not get cold.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Open your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, you’re warm… put your arms around me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Take your shirt off.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Horses.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You don’t forget anything, do you?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hello… hello. How are you this morning?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Do they talk?!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, they don’t talk… We talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, you’re pretty…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I gave you a baby last night.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: They are beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes, they are.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.
You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: It will be human and it will look like
this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything
you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to
have.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I told you it’s impossible for me to have a
baby.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You will have this baby. If you want it.
If you don’t, I can stop it now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I want it.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Hello George.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Shermin…</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: What’s all this for?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We have a new directive. I’m taking over.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: We don’t have to do it that way. We can
catch him this time.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Washington thinks it’s too late for that.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I’ve never been taken off an assignment in
my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I’ll have him for you.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re not hearing me.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You can change a directive, George. You’ve
done it before. Listen to me. He’s going somewhere in Death Valley.
Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear
site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike.
I’m telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got
him.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’ll do that. But how are we going to hold
him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: That’s the chance we have to take.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: No, we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Then you’re going to have to do it without
me.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re a career intelligence officer, Shermin.
You’ll be in the air with us.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: You’re talking about taking a life. The
most unique life form on this planet. I think we’re better than
that.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Is this gambling?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: The cowboys were right. You can make money
fast gambling.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You don’t make money gambling. You lose
it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Do you have a good map of Death Valley?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: We should have. Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: May I have twenty-five cents, please?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I want to gamble.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Here are two quarters. When you lose these,
you’re not going to get anymore.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I understand. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This is crazy. We don’t have time for
this.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I know how to gamble now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don’t
get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I want to get money for you and the
baby.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t need any money for the baby. I’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Inflation, tuition, college. Children are
damned expensive. I know.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The cook again?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: If I ever run into that guy, I’m going to
kick his ass.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’ll tell you pretty much everything about
us…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: This is very interesting. We are born
knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Any words you don’t know you can find in the
dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’ll give you the different countries, how
they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the
governments, the languages… everything.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Many of my people will not believe those
things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one
people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What will you say about us?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I will say that we can be friends.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We can.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This is yours…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: If you want to keep it, you can.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’d like to…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Would you put some of your singing in this
for the baby?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: You want the baby to laugh at me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How long will it take you to get home?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Many, many days and nights…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Would you like to listen to some music?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m sure we could find a country and western
station.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Which star is yours?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: The yellow one.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, wow… I’ll tell you what. When the baby is
born, we’ll go out in my back yard and wave to you.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I will wave to you.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: They’re trying to get him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What are you doing?!!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Mrs. Haydn…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: This is George Fox…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I want to speak to Marc Shermin.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I’m in charge
of this operation now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: If I don’t speak to Mr. Shermin, I’m hanging
up.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Mr. Shermin wants to speak to you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Here he is.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: We can’t let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I don’t want to hurt anybody. I just want
to go home.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: All the roads into Death Valley are
blocked. We’d like to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Hold on a minute… Let’s take the chance,
George.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: No deal.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I’m afraid we can’t let you go.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I
must go alone now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I said I would get you to your ship and
that’s where we’re going to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I hope that works.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It works.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I do not know how many times I can do
this.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: If my ship is not here, we are in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: distinctive cone</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: In front!!! In front!!!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I can’t shoot anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I won’t let anyone hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Watch it. They’re coming out.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: End it, Shermin.</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: George… Do you hear me, George?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: I just retired.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Shermin!! Shermin!!!</p>
<p><strong>shermin</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Shermin!!!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Lock in.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>star man</strong>: I must go.</p>
