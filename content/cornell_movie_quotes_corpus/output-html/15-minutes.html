<p><strong>emil</strong>: Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say.
Don’t open your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Don’t fool around.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I want to document my trip to America.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Next. Could I see your
documents, please?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: What is your intended purpose
of your visit to the United States?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Two weeks holiday.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: How much money are you carrying
with you?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I have five-hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Can you show me? Sir, no
cameras in the FIS area!</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Is he with you? Are you
travelling together?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Please join us. Come on
forward.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: No, you’re travelling together.
I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at
your documents? Are you related?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Yes…he’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Okay. You’re a Czech national
and you’re a Russian national. How do you know one another?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: We are both from Prague.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: How long are you planning to
stay?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: I’d like to speak for himself,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: He doesn’t speak English.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I speak English.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Then answer my questions. Where
were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you’re here?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: New York.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Yes, we’re in New York now. But
where are you planning to stay in New York?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: A cheap hotel.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: What are you coming here to
do?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I’m here for movies.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Movies…to be in the movies or
to see movies?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie
at school called “It’s a Wonderful Life” directed by Frank Capra. Ever
since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A
land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: He made joke, bad joke. First time on
airplane…</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Well, they’ve got valid visas,
but they don’t have much money. Uh… and I’m not…uh, I think there’s a
possibility they may be coming to live and reside.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Look how long the line is. We gotta move
’em out. I’ll take them down to secondary.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So we’re waitin’ to hit this warrant - we got
Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin’ by - ready to go. I
say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM!
All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right
where I was standin’. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown
off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and
it’s over. If I hadn’t gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I
would’ve had my head blown off.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>paulie</strong>: Speakin’ of bad habits, everybody okay?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Another martini.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Vodka tonic.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Maybe you could just put in a shot of
Martell?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It was freaky, I’ll tell you. Stupid kid.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile
I’m not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this
guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan.
Six hours ago this guy was walkin’ his dog or buyin’ a quart of milk.
Who knows? But some kid’s robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him
and now you can’t tell if he’s a piece of beef or a human being and I’m
thinkin’ that’s me. Sooner or later. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Sooner or later that’s everybody.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I
mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here
and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I think you’re getting a little moody
there, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m not moody.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Isn’t he a little moody?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Of course he’s moody. He thinks he’s in
love.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: In love? With who?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How old are your kids?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: My kids? Let’s see…Susan’s 15. Aundrea’s 9.
Don’t tell me you’re thinking about having a kid! How old are you? Never
mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids
- they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you
whole… It’s all true! Before I had kids when friends talked about their
kids, I wanted to vomit. Now – I get it. Am I right, Leon?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Absomotherfuckin’lutely. You can have all
three of my ex-wives. But somebody so much as looks sideways at my four
girls – I’d kill ’em. You haven’t seen my youngest have you?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Paulie, you’ve got kids, right?</p>
<p><strong>paulie</strong>: My kids don’t talk to me anymore but they
were great when they were young.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Sure it’s him? Great! Unique’s home.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Paulie, I need the cure.</p>
<p><strong>paulie</strong>: Step into my office.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: So you got your kids listening to Opera?
You still singing in the church on the weekends?</p>
<p><strong>secondary officer</strong>: Okay. You work in a vodka
factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I am butcher.</p>
<p><strong>secondary officer</strong>: You’re a butcher? What do you use
pig intestines for?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: You stuff sausage in it.</p>
<p><strong>secondary officer</strong>: And what do you do with the
bones?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Dog food.</p>
<p><strong>secondary officer</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: No. Are you proposing?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Will you marry me? Wanna get married? What
are you doin’ Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m gonna propose.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Tomorrow. At lunch.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: The thrill of the hunt. I love it.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Look. Times Square. Just like in the
movies!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Don’t speak Russian!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in
Czech?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Because I don’t like your ugly language. I
heard enough of it in school! Now speak Czech or English. And don’t fool
around anymore. You almost got us thrown out!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder.
Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: We have no money. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Where you wanna go, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: So what’s unique?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Not what. Who.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’s from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking
too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her
with a beer bottle.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: That’s unique.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. And he still went to the party.</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: Top floor. Back room.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. I make big cases, they make the news
and I look good. But the problem with becoming a star is downtown. They
shoot at stars. Now be quiet. Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I hope this prick doesn’t run. My knees are
killing me. Stay behind me.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: You’re worried for my safety. I’m
touched.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Keep them out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Okay. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: COME ON! COME ON! YOU FUCKING GUYS, LET’S
MOVE IT!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s your rush? Going to a party?</p>
<p><strong>unique</strong>: Why you chasin’ me, man?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know. You always come outta your
house that way?</p>
<p><strong>unique</strong>: It’s not my house, man. I don’t live
here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, sounds like burglary to me.</p>
<p><strong>unique</strong>: I know you man.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Any chance we can do that again?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Again? I didn’t wanna do it the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Turn that off! Get the bags.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Why should I carry your bag? I am not a
dog.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: For five years I paid for your stupidness -
you’ll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. Unless you
refuse, Oleg.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: There. 5RW.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Smell like chemicals…for smoking drugs.</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Emil???!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Surprise! Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Your sister said she didn’t know where you
were so you shouldn’t write to her with return address if you’re
hiding.</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Did you hurt her?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: You know me…I never hurt anybody. Where’s the
money?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Hello, Tamina.</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Take your eyes off her, Oleg! Look. It wasn’t
my fault you two were caught. It’s his fault. Trying to get the bank
clerk’s phone number?! I wasn’t going to wait!!!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Milos. Get my money!</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: We spent it!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Ha. Ha.</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Look at the way we live. I’m a plumber. You
think I’d be working if I had money?!</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Emil. Put down the knife.</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Emil. I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: I can get you a job.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: A job?</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Yes, the money is good.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: As a plumber?!</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: It’s easy to learn.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to
America to work!</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: We started over, you can too.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: You spent all the money while I was in prison?
Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: She saw!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Daphne Hanlova.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Six month visa. Still here two years later.
They’ll deport her if she goes to Police.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I’m going to make a bohemian barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Got any spare change? How ’bout a spare
twenty?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Look, I don’t have time for you, get out of
my way!!</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Alright, how ‘bout all your fuckin’
money?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Okay, you’re under arrest! Now you happy?</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Fire Department? Firemen don’t carry
guns.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Oh yeah? Guess again.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Nice - how many people you ripped off
tonight?! Get up!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You couldn’t listen to me, could you?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’ll send a cop back for you.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Hey. C’mon, you can’t leave me like this.
Some freak’ll come by and stab me!</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Wait! Come back!!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Lieutenant - take up your line and relieve
Ladder Company 60 on the top floor.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Hey, Louie, were you first due?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Yeah, I radioed you guys right away ’cause
you got two roasts on the top floor but you don’t hafta investigate
cause homicide is up there.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Homicide? Who let them up? I didn’t make it a
crime scene yet.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Hey, it’s Eddie Flemming.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Yo, Jordy!</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I heard. Who the hell let them up there?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: I don’t know, you think Eddie will give me
his autograph?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You see anything in the crowd? Anybody
suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Naw - I’m sure the suspect’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Oh yeah, why?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: ’Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
now!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
position - that they were doin’ each other but were so whacked out of
their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got
fried. What do you think, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know. We got the experts here. Show
them what you found - I hope you don’t mind, we came over to see if we
could help.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby
Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a
rookie.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job
is picking up scents.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, I found - check it out - crack pipe.
Looks like they got careless.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mind not shining that light in my eyes?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Sorry, bro.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Hey, that’s great you guys got it all wrapped
up, but you don’t mind if we go through the routine? It gives us
somethin’ to do.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, we don’t mind. You mind Leon?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Thanks. Appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
good patterns - about thirty minutes old.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Mouth’s clean, too.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Clean?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Don’t blow your nose!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: The smoke’ll permeate your nostrils - burn
’em out. Let it run.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: But you knew that, right?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: So the way you see it, two crack heads burned
themselves up?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s what it looks like to me.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: And while they’re burning up, they’re still
goin’ down on each other? You got to hand it to them.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah, well, some people got their priorities
straight.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Evidence. Of a homicide.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You know what that is, right?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Why don’t you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello!
You mind punching a hole in the floor?</p>
<p><strong>camello</strong>: No problem. Excuse me, gentlemen. You might
wanna back up a little more. Don’t wanna get your pants wet.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: They have not soot in their mouths, which
means they weren’t breathin’ before the fire and that usually means they
were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they
were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid
and positioned like this on the bed. To the untrained eye, it looks like
an accident.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s he looking for?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: A timer.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Here you go. A big double homicide.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: You see Eddie’s face when I gave him the
timer? Wish I had a picture of it.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: He knew all along.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: That’s why he was so quiet. He was testing
us.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Detective, does it look like a
murder?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We don’t know that yet. It’s much too early.
There’s a lot to be done.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: How many victims are up there?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There are two bodies found at this point.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Can we go up to the crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know you can’t do that. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Is it drug related?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We don’t know. When I have more I’ll let you
know.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Detective…what’s that you’re holding in
your hand? Evidence?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: There was a woman - I think she wanted to
talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: You motherfuckin’ bastard! She stripped me!
It was a bag lady! She touched me all over, it was disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: A dog pissed on me!! I’m gonna sue you for
this! You violated my civil rights!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I
could arrest you right now! You’re lucky you’re walking away from this.
Now get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>roseanne</strong>: So you slept with your son’s wife! What’s
that all about?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I take full responsibility for sleepin’ with
my daughter in law. I had low self esteem, I thought I had to compete
with him.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Self-esteem? Self-esteem??</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Losin’ my job and everything, caused my
behavioral disorder. Forgive me, Kirk. Let me hug you?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Turn that fucking thing off!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I’m not filming. I’m watching Milos die. It’s
just like a move but realer.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Speak English!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: You said speak Czech!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: How you erase this?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I’ll do it. Don’t hurt my camera!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Stupid, Milos. I didn’t want to kill him.
What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Worldly escorts?</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: Hi?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: Are you looking for companionship?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Whore?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I’m homesick. You have Eastern European girl?
A Czech girl?</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
girl.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I take her. Send her!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Now that you know him, maybe you can get
extra work in the next movie they make about him.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Maybe you can be his stand-in.</p>
<p><strong>chief duffy</strong>: What the hell is that?? You gave Eddie
Flemming the evidence?!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Who did cause and origin?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Who do you think, Chief?!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Then why didn’t you talk to the reporter?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: ’Cause we got more important things to do,
like finding out who did it.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Don’t you guys understand? It’s all about
image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys
overtime.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What was that, Korfin?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: I said, yeah, you’re right, Chief. As soon
as we get somethin’ we’ll let you alert the media.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: You do that, wiseguy. Now let’s solve this
thing before Eddie Flemming does.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: Hey guys, I got your torch. He just gave a
full confession.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s my fire! Screw homicide. I’ll tell you
guys everything!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: What’s that on your forehead, Max? That’s a
nice attention getter.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I’m religious. I’m not an Atheist like
you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: How did you start the fire this time?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I used an accelerant.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Yeah? What kind?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, by the way, I’m really sorry about your
wife leavin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …Yeah, and with your old man dying last year
you - what’s it? Just you and the dog now?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Max!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy your
ex-wife’s seeing - I hear he’s a big shot downtown.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: That’s it! You’re outta here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s it. I’m suing.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Get in line.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: What’s so funny. How does he know so much
about me? Who tells him my life story?</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: He hangs around downstairs. The guys talk to
him. He’s a joke…</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: He’s no joke! One day he’s gonna graduate
from trash can fires and do something big.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: Okay. Okay. We’ll ban him from the
station.</p>
<p><strong>robert hawkins</strong>: Good evening, I’m Robert Hawkins and
this is Top Story. Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with
Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went
berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store. But now,
Mr. Geller’s claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the
victim. According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not
his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist. Hard to
believe…watch.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Louder.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Louder.</p>
<p><strong>stephen geller</strong>: This had nothing to do with shoes
that didn’t fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made
a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died
because of the criminal actions of my doctor.</p>
<p><strong>robert hawkins</strong>: Your doctor?</p>
<p><strong>stephen geller</strong>: Yes. My psychiatrist didn’t insist
that I stay on my medication.</p>
<p><strong>robert hawkins</strong>: …so you feel absolutely no
responsibility for killing these people?</p>
<p><strong>stephen geller</strong>: It was my finger that pulled the
trigger, but I’m not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I
was capable of. How could I know. I’m not a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>robert hawkins</strong>: You seem very savvy for a man who’s
been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.</p>
<p><strong>stephen geller</strong>: Look, I’m a victim here, too. I was
a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I’ll never graduate. My
life has been permanently disrupted.</p>
<p><strong>robert hawkins</strong>: Permanently disrupted? Aren’t you
selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn’t this ‘incident’
as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?</p>
<p><strong>stephen geller</strong>: Look, I’m in here. You call this a
career move?</p>
<p><strong>robert hawkins</strong>: And isn’t there a movie in the works
about you?</p>
<p><strong>stephen geller</strong>: We’re in negotiations, that’s
correct.</p>
<p><strong>robert hawkins</strong>: But doesn’t the Son of Sam Law
prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?</p>
<p><strong>stephen geller</strong>: That doesn’t apply to me because I’m
not a criminal. I’m not a criminal! I wasn’t convicted.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I love America. No one is responsible for what
they do.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Get in the bathroom!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut
up!</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Hi, I’m Honey.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Where’s Czech girl?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Baby, I’m anybody you want me to be. I’m a
little schoolgirl, I’m mommy, I’m a Czech girl.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Now I like to get business out of the way
before we get down to pleasure. Why don’tchya put my money on the
dresser.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you know
her?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: It’s an outcall service run out of an
apartment. I don’t meet the other girls. Aren’t you gonna get
undressed?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Where is escort service?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: That’s confidential. Could you put the money
on the dresser?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I like to talk to the person who runs the
service. Can you give me address?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Look. Do we have a problem here? There’s no
reason to have a problem. I’m gonna make you feel real good. You wanna
Czech girl? After I’m done with you, you won’t miss her. Now why don’t
you pay me?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Listen to me. I don’t want sex. Just give me
the address and then you go.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Look, man, I don’t give a shit if you want
sex or not, but you’re payin’ for my time.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Give me the address!!</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Alright, alright - don’t hurt me! Please,
it’s in my book, in my purse!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Her lips are fuller than that. You can see
’em a mile away.</p>
<p><strong>composite artist</strong>: What about her cheek bones?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes
were huge. Big, blue eyes and when I saw her, she looked scared. Like
she was looking to get away. But she was absolutely beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I gotta good look at her.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: – From Czechoslovakia? And how long have
they been livin’ in your building? Alright, I’ll be in touch when we
know somethin’. Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to
themselves. Landlord don’t know who your girl is.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: How long they been livin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: You hear that question, Garcia?</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
they’ve been here illegally.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Well, they’re definitely permanent residents
now.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: I got the owner of the plumbing company
Milos worked for.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Why don’t we get some sleep and we’ll go see
him in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You go home. I’m takin’ your car and goin’
back to the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Aren’t you tired?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: If I go home I won’t be able to fall asleep
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: She keepin’ you up? Like to meet her, huh?
She’d make you forget your ex wife. Cure your insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay to smoke?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: It’s your crime scene now. You can do what
you want.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Watch the news?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Nah, I musta missed it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the
credit.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Well, just so you know, I don’t care about
that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Nah, why should you?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I don’t even watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Good. Good. Commendable.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Did you get a report from the M.E.?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sure. But I would like to ask you something.
You got a problem with me?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: If you found me steppin’ on your crime scene
- it might piss you off, too. What about the report?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You were right, they were both dead before
the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of
the knife in his spine. That’s usually an indicator of something
personal.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: The Super said he’d seen her before but she
didn’t live here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pretty.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Hmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe you don’t care about that either.
Prettiest suspect I’ve had in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Who says she’s a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What would you call her?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Look, I’m not even sure she has anything to
do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead.
Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who
knows?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Obviously they weren’t having sex. As you
pointed out. So why go through all the trouble of putting ’em like
that?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Maybe it’s a ritual thing or someone trying
to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern
Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper
funeral, it’s like condemning them to hell.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania?
Hungary?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been
fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are
very intense people and they take things personally.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah? Where? You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh.
Really? Okay. We’ve got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue. A
stabbing. Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian…</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There wasn’t a fire. There’ll be nothing for
you to do.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I’ll learn
something.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This isn’t homicide school.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: My parents are from Poland. I can help with
the Eastern European angle.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re Polish?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: My folks are.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: This is second day in America. First day was
very exciting. Full of thrills and chills. Over there, is co-star of my
new movie, Emil!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: New York’s finest. This is his case.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: This all you want?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Do you know how much killer gets for movie
rights?</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: In here, says he wants a million.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Million?! The killer gets one million dollars
for a television interview?</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial
killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica
got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be
a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yes. Both.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: And these.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Get a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Let me help.</p>
<p><strong>blind woman</strong>: Thank you, son.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Takin’ a bath.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Any I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Still unknown but we’re running prints. Kid
over there caught the case.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Sorry…PD only.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tommy Cullen. Heard a lot about you. Nice to
meet you. Here’s what we got. A girl in there, figure her to be a
prostitute, looks like she was fighting for her life. She’s got defense
wounds on her hands. Right this way - in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: After you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Room was registered to a Francis Capra.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Capra? That’s not Czech or Russian. Who said
he sounded Russian?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The clerk?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Check the switchboard, see what phone calls
were made from this room.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Clothes were off in the other room. Tub is
dry except for the blood.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Any of you guys take a piss lately?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Do the seat for me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Only one guys checked in?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: C’mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here
- make yourself useful.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Our killer…our killer’s standing here
slashing at her. She’s fightin’ him. The blood is splattering this way.
It’s on this wall… And there’s some specks over here. There’s nothing
here because someone was standing right here. Someone big. And he’s got
blood on him. Lots of blood. He wouldn’t walk out of here like that.
Murphy, what kind of knife you think we’re talking about here?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If you look here where he missed and hit the
wall you see that the marks aren’t deep but they’re kinda wide… not your
everyday kitchen or pocket knife.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What if the tip was broken off?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Could be. Then we should find it here
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I think we’ve already found it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There was only one call from this room last
night. I dialed it. It’s an escort service.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Did you identify yourself?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, I’m new but I’m not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Call communications and get an address on
that number.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Good work.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You goin’ to the escort service?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You got any better ideas?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Mind if I ride along with you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This has nothing to do with your fire.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: But what if it does? You might need my
help.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for my
son?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll let you know what happens.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: This is ridiculous. I’m not gonna be in your
way - we can talk the case over.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Tell you what - I’ll flip you a coin. If you
win you can come with me. If you don’t win, you don’t come.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’ll call it… tails.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay. I’ll call it. Heads.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Heads. See, you lost twice. Okay. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh here. A souvenir.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Two heads.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Better than one.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Police. We’d like to ask you a few
questions.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I have nothin’ to say. If you wanna contact my
attorney…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Homicide, Miss Hearn. It’s Detective Eddie
Flemming. Open up.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You! I’ve seen you on TV!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: C’mon in. C’mon in!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Just a minute. Shit. And I don’t have a
camera. Hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We don’t have her I.D. yet, but one of your
girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Do you remember the man who called?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia,
but I sent him Honey ’cause once they get there, you know, it doesn’t
really matter - Honey was killed…? Poor girl…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Do you have any Czech girls working for
you?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Did you tell him you did?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Boy, she’s so popular all the sudden.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about
her, too.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: This her?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah. Sort of. I tried to recruit her, gave
her my card. She said she’d think about it but I never heard from
her.</p>
<p><strong>butch girl</strong>: Beautiful eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Who came by looking for her?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: He said he was her cousin. I told him where
she works. They were just here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Describe him.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy
with him was…shorter, with a wrestler’s build. And he wouldn’t turn his
videocamera off me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He had a videocamera? Where is she?
Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: She washes hair up at Ludwig’s - a salon on
63rd and Madison.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair
salon. Ludwig’s.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m on my way with Eddie. Ludwig’s. 63rd and
Madison. The suspects might be there already.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m on duty.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So am I. Alright, I’ll go inside and you
cover the back.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a
kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun
and yelling ‘Freeze!’ at the bad guy! What’d you dream about?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I wanted to run up to a building on fire,
kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Then I guess we’re doin’ this the right way,
aren’t we? If we pull up to a burning building I’ll gladly let you go
first.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Daphne Handlova?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Daphne? In the back. Probably
shampooing a customer’s hair.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Why are you messing with your hair color
again? You’re going to kill your hair. You won’t look good with black
hair.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I want to do it, alright?</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Well, then do it after work. A customer’s
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I…I have a temper.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: When I lose it, I lose control. I didn’t
intend to kill Milos but he stole from me. Cheated me! When I went to
prison, they beat me. I still didn’t tell he was my partner. I loved
Milos like a brother…</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I’m not a killer.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Daphne, will you be coming back to work?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: In a minute, Ludwig.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Smart girl. I’m glad you’re not a whore. But
washing hair? This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you. They
should be washing your hair.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I don’t want to kill you. But if you talk, I
will. I thought you’d want these.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: …Daphne?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m a fire marshal. You remember me from the
other night? You are Daphne, right?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You don’t have to be afraid. We’re here to
protect you. Come with me. We want to talk to you. You speak English
alright?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Did he give you these? Was he just here?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: The other side of the street. The guy with
the videocamera. Don’t look - put her in the car. Stay this side.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Stay with her.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Put the fuckin’ camera down! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Split up!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Emil, look!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Perfect! Cut. Print!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Are you hit?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Bobby, Bobby! Where’re you hit?!</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: It hurts. Aw, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the
whole time!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don’t worry,
we’ll get those fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Detective - can you tell us what happened
here?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I can’t talk right now. We have some things
to take care of.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: I understand, but I noticed that the Fire
Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire
department?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I really can’t give out any information right
now at this point.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Okay. But I do understand that your
partner, Leon Jackson’s been injured. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He was hurt, but not seriously. He’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Do you have the suspect in custody?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Um…now is not a good time, okay. Detective
Jackson’s hurt. He’s fine. I’ve got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
Jackson is hurt but not seriously.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Alright, cut, cut, cut.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Eddie, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. Now’s not a good time.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Alright?</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I told your partner, I can’t help. I didn’t
see anything.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: C’mon, start at the beginning. You know these
people?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was
broken, she let me use theirs.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Whether you tell us or not, we’ll find out.
Better if it comes from you.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: If I tell you, will you arrest me?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest
you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are you hiding? Why are you afraid</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: She just saw two of her friends killed! They
probably threatened her.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Is that all there is?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Are you here illegally? Don’t worry about
that. We’ll talk to Immigration. They won’t deport you.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: No, no, don’t talk to Immigration!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Something back home?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: …my little sister and I shared a flat - I
came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair…
He came at me and I shot him.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Alright. That’s a justifiable homicide.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Yes, but he was a cop.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: A cop?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I’m from a small town in Slovakia. Like the
South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Look, we can help you but right now we have
to deal with what’s happening here. Tell us the truth…is that the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: You’re a cop - you’ll never believe me.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: She’s fucked. Even if that story is true.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Raw deal.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get,
they’re all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You wanna talk to her alone?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What would your girlfriend think of that?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I don’t have a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: My point exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m serious here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: C’mon. You intimidate her ’cause you’re a
celebrity. She sees me differently.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re her Savior? Is she the kid you’re
gonna save from the burning building?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You know what I’m saying here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay, tell you what, I’ll give you a head
start. You take her to the station house. Don’t let her out of your
sight. She’s the only warm body we got left.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Hey. I’m a professional.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Women like that have a way of turning
professionals into amateurs.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Gotta light the scene better. Now it’s more
moody… like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: This is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Don’t want to film this?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Now I become custody of police
department?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they’ll
help you with your situation.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I will if they don’t send me back.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: They won’t until this is over.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Divorced.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Do you live alone? I’ve been in these
clothes since…the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a
shower…before I go into custody?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I can’t take you to my place.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I want to talk to you about something
serious.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I want to live the rest of my life with you…I
don’t know you’ve been married before and I’ve never been married, but I
do love you, and…</p>
<p><strong>paulie</strong>: She’s here.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Hey, honey.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: What is your problem? Why’d you snap at
me? I just wanted a statement.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I can’t…I can’t answer you just because you
want me to answer you!</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: You didn’t have to embarrass me in front
of my colleagues. You could give me something.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. Did I embarrass you,
sweetheart? Oh…</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe I should just, ya know…turn to the
cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Alright, alright, Eddie. Don’t patronize
me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Yes you are. I’m not just some reporter.
I don’t just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me
something.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, well you took the camera and put it
right down on the evidence. That was…</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: That was good. You were holding the
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You were merciless. You didn’t give a shit if
you got me or not.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Well, who was it that taught me how to do
that? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re ruthless.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: You’re not so bad yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Look at this. You have blood on your
shirt. Whose is it?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Could be Leon’s.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Jesus. And last week you came over with
blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know, I been thinkin’…these shoes might
look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know, Nicky, I’ve been married twice
before. My first wife was a professional woman, didn’t have time for
children. My second wife…I never wanted to go home to her.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: What are you doing? What are you
saying?</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Don’t worry about the damn phone. I won’t
answer it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Answer the phone.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: No. Tell me what you want to say.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Answer it.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a
second. They only call me when it’s an emergency. Just hold that
thought. Can you call back?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: We need you here in twenty minutes. Get
in a cab.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Katie. We don’t know where she is. We
can’t find her. You gotta anchor the 5:00. This is your shot. Come
now.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: What? Oh. Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They
want me to anchor tonight!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Okay. That is great. But I can’t go now,
we’re in the middle of something here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No. Go ahead. You’re gonna be great.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: No. No, listen to me here. I want to know
what you’re talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages
and…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll tell you tonight. Let’s do it tonight.
As soon as you get back we’ll talk. We’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I promise. We’ll talk. You’ll be great.
You’ll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh… Just look into the lens
and imagine you’re talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Yeah. I’ll do that. As long as you’re not
patronizing me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Patronizing you… Nay, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Okay, til tonight.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: You promise?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Okay. And you know what, I’ll swing by my
place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to
yours…How’s that… Would that be a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Good thing.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: See you later. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Don’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: The men are out of quarters - practicing
putting out fires.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: So…the station is empty?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Yeah. This way.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You considered becoming a prostitute?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Yes, I considered it.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Did you ever turn tricks before?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: What about back home?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I came here. I had no money. I knew no one.
I couldn’t get a job because you have to have a green card to get work.
They approached me - I could’ve made a lot of money. I considered it,
but… it’s not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig’s.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: So you were never a prostitute?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: What are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m just trying to find out who you are.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Can you let me go?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Showers are this way.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: You could shower with me.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’ll uh, I’ll get you a towel.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I’m not a whore. I’m not a whore.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: You don’t know. I’m sorry. I was desperate.
That’s not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they’ll do to me when
I got to prison?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: They’re not gonna send you right back.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to…I’m glad.
Actually I’m glad it’s over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to
look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I
was. Never trusting anyone…</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to
erase it.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: And the whore’s murder? You didn’t erase that
either, did you? Don’t lie, I won’t be angry.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Put the camera down, Oleg.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: What does it look like? It’s an address
book!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Let me get a shot of it.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: This way. Hold it this way. Good.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Why won’t you be angry at me for keeping my
movie?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Hey. Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: I came to see how the investigation was
going. I called and you’re not here. I wait up at the station and you
don’t even show up!!! I beep you - you don’t return my call. Where the
hell have you been?!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We
stopped there… so she could get cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What do you mean, ‘cleaned up?’</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I let her take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: A shower!? Did you take one, too?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: No! Nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Oh really. That’s nice. You took a homicide
witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of
your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin’ dates?!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I told him to take her there.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Tommy, get her outta here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This way, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There was too much press hangin’ around
there. I didn’t want her face on the news. So I told him to take her to
a quiet area until things settled down.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It was my decision, not his.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Well, I’m the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and
every now and then I’d like to be included in decisions.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the
press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Oh yeah…? Alright.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m ready to be briefed. Excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Yeah, sure. Beep me when you’re ready for the
press conference.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Will do, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Eddie, I…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Guys…give me a few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Look, Eddie, I’m tellin’ you - I didn’t touch
her.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, you shoulda because nobody’s gonna
believe you didn’t…including me.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I took her there for a shower and that’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Just a shower?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing
happened. Look, I’m sure you probably think I’m a fool and I fucked up,
but…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, I don’t think you were a fool, I just
think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know
better. You don’t know her well enough. She’s got the potential to
fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it’s
fuckin’ over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one
fucking bit of difference. You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I told you, you know, I thought I was doing
the right thing, you know, I think she’s innocent.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, it’s not up to you to decide whether
she’s innocent or not. Don’t you understand, that’s why you’re a
professional.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: But, I mean, didn’t you ever go out on a limb
for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin’ her whole
story…I believed her.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How you go out on a limb for somebody is by
giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here’s a number of
an Immigration lawyer. That’s how you help her. But you can’t get
involved in her like that. You’re gonna jeopardize your career, your
life and you’re gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another
piece of advice. Maybe you don’t watch TV but I’ll let you in on a
little secret - the whole fuckin’ world watches television. And when you
get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little
fuckin’ itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier
for my job. And I get more done because of it.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Why’d you help me back there with the Chief?
Why’d you stand up for me like that?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know, I don’t know. I like you. You
remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time,
but I still kept him.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s Flemming…anything turn up? Did they
check the hospitals? Airports? Yeah, I hit him! I fuckin’ hit him! We
should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything! These
guys are from fuckin’ Czechoslovakia…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll call you later.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Nicky!?!?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Nicky?!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: So…who’s Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Your opinion. You see, they going to make a
movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s your accomplishment.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I kill someone famous.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Then do it, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays
you will want to die like hero.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: So tabloids don’t have to do re enactments.
They going to have real movie this time.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: If you kill me and film it you’re putting a
noose around your neck.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men
would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are
caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?
Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be
acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and
because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it. Because of your
Double Jeopardy law, we can’t be tried for same crime twice. We come out
free, rich and famous!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Good idea!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You really think you’ll be able to fool a
jury with this bullshit? How fuckin’ stupid are you?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Smarter than Americans. You’re fed cry baby
talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they’ll cry
for me. So…Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to
your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the
camera!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Cut!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: This is my project. I say ‘action.’ I am the
director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say ‘action!’</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: And…action!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Bad last moment - I cut that out.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Die. Die.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: ..Detective Flemming was one of the most
decorated NYPD detectives in the history of New York. He made several
thousand arrests during his career, including the famed Stephen Geller
case. Beloved by the community in which he served. His partner eulogized
him…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Eddie was my mentor, my best friend and my
partner…he taught me the meaning of the word ‘cop.’ He was a man in
every sense of the word. I’ll miss him… Sleep well, brother.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Awful…what an awful day. He was New York
City.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I never got to tell him how much I admired
him.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I know, son, I know. We all loved him.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: You know…you know he was gonna propose to
me. The crime guys found a card he’d written out to me. And a ring
box…these fuckers that killed him - have my ring. They have my diamond
engagement ring…</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: What do you mean you know? He told you he
was gonna propose to me?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Well, he…</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: I want to hear everything he said.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I’m trying to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Alright. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: That morning. He was talking to me and Leon
about marriage.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He
started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his
closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked
out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: I’d never had a great relationship
before. I’d never made great choices with men. And he wasn’t easy to get
to know. He was older, my parents told me I was nuts to get involved
with him. But he was so great to me. Always encouraging, telling me I
could do anything… He was the one. You know, I’d give up everything -
everything - for just a little more time. I would’ve spent fifteen
minutes with him if that’s all I knew I had.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Robert…?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’ve got a call.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I can’t talk to anybody right now, can’t
you see I’m busy! I can’t talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. Get her
a whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Trust me, you’ll want to take this call.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Hello? Who is this? How do I know this is
you?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Come to 45 Broadway. Don’t bring the Police.
Come alone or you’ll be in my next film.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Look asshole. I’ve been threatened by
better than you.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: No. I’m the best that’s ever threatened
you.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I’ll meet you on one condition - I get
exclusivity and you surrender to me.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: We’ll talk about that. Four o’clock gives you
time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: What? It doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: If you don’t want my film - I’ll call another
show. And they will show it.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Come alone. Bring cash. And we’ll talk about
surrendering.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Yeah. He finished awhile ago.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick
up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Chief - mind if I take her?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Okay. But not water sports.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Consider yourself served.</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the department
and the city of New York for 10 million? Who is Zwangendaba?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: The mugger.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I still can’t believe Eddie’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Hello. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Is he your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Ludwig? He’s gay - are you jealous?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: If I was your boyfriend, I might be.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: If you were my boyfriend, I’d suggest you
find another girlfriend that isn’t going to jail ten-thousand miles
away.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: A good Immigration lawyer could stall the
process. Eddie recommended one.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: No matter what happens…I’m glad I met
you.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m glad I met you.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Let’s get your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You better get packed.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Do you have coffee?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: In the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’ll make some for us.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I’ll get my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>setting the ceiling on fire and releasing a rain of fire
into</strong>: THE ROOM. Jordy JUMPS BACK.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Jordy!!!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: No! Get back! GET BACK!!!</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: That’s not mine!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Don’t! It’ll suck the flames toward us!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: This is Jordan Warsaw! We got a 1075, make it
quick, we’re trapped! 8th Avenue and 44th Street.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Oh my G-d! Oh my G-d!</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: They were here!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Calm down. Get a hold of yourself! Get
down!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Oh Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Pouring it out!</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: This is great film! You can see fire right now
- Daphne is in fire - Fire Marshal is here. Everything is so messy.
Everything is so crazy right here! Look at this fire! We made it! 90% of
people who die in fire die from eating smoke. So most likely they all
die from eating smoke.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: And this is the man who started the fire. Say
something to your fans, Emil!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Get back! Get out of the bathroom! Run!</p>
<p><strong>7-year old kid</strong>: The hallway is on fire!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: It’s okay. I’m a fireman. I’m going to help
you. Get back! Now!</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: Jordy! What the hell happened?!</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: Are you alright, man? Lemme see the
hand!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Where’s Daphne? Daphne?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Isn’t she a beauty? She’s my fire, look at
that loom-up on her!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I did this! I did this! Take my picture! I’m
Max! Max Gornick!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>korfin</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: They were inside. They booby trapped her
apartment!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What the hell are you talking about???
They’re gonna do what?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Where is he?! Where is Hawkins?!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He’s not on the premises!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I want the tape. Go get it and bring it here
this minute.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Any request for the video must be directed
to “Top Story’s” attorney - Bruce Cutler. I’ll be happy to give you his
number.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Lady, if you put Eddie’s murder on TV, I’ll
get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it’ll come
outta your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I want your shield number!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Viewer discretion advised!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You want the tape? There it is!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: What we are about to broadcast is very
graphic footage…</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: America! Who says you can’t be success in
America? I arrived with nothing, knowing nobody - now look - I am a
success story!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: You are success story? I am success story! Why
do you say I and not we?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Oleg, don’t be paranoid. You got a
hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn’t you? I gave you half of what they
gave me. Look - here we are!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Good evening. Welcome to “Top Story”.
Tonight, I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never
before seen on television. And I do so with a heavy heart. You will be
first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide
Detective, Eddie Flemming. It would be only normal to ask, why? Why are
we showing something so journalist, I must show it. A democracy survives
through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening
then we don’t deserve our democracy, or our freedom. Eddie Flemming was
my friend. I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this
violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward.
Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this
material is absolutely not appropriate for children.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: In movie they make of us, who do you think
would act me?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: The one who got caught in the bathroom. George
Michael.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Shut up. Look!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: This is my project. I say ‘action.’ I am the
director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say ‘action.’ And
‘action!’</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Bad last moment - I cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I told you to cut that out before we handed in
the tape!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Be quiet. Watch.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Die. Die.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Why did you leave that stuff in about you
being the director?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Because I am the director. Don’t you realize,
if it wasn’t for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way
would we be sitting here right now.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Your idea? I thought it was my idea.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Aren’t you just the cameraman?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: I’m serious…this - this is a great American
film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Credit?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put
titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg
Razgul.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yes. But there’s only one problem - you want
credit but the problem is - I don’t share credit.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: You got that?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: No, I don’t get that!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: You think you are a director? You are a
fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking
hate you.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Oh, hello.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Are you my attorney? I’m Emil. I’m insane.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I’m not your lawyer until I see the
money.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Here. I have your money.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Oh no! No! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down.
What do you need? What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: He has the camera! He took the movie!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Don’t move! Don’t move! Get your hands up!
Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I give up!</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: This man is unarmed, officer. He’s
surrendered.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: What are you hitting him for?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Turn that camera off!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: No. Keep filming…</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Don’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yes. Yes, come with me!</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I’m invoking rights - this man is
represented by counsel. I’m coming with him.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Turn that camera off!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ll take him.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: No way! He’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: We’re takin’ him. Don’t argue!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: He’s my collar!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, he killed my partner!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: He’s yours but I take him in! I’ll drive him
to the precinct, you can have him but I’m walkin’ him in.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes. I’ll follow
you. Tommy, you ride with him!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’re goin’ down, motherfucker, you are goin’
down. I’ll be there with a smile when they put you down!</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Don’t say a word. Don’t respond to his
taunting! He’s represented by counsel. You want to speak to someone -
you speak to me!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Out of the way, counselor.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Don’t you put your hands on me,
Detective.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And you, you’ll pay for what you did!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: This footage will work in your favor. When
the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they’ll convict
him.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: If I didn’t put it on somebody else would!
I was his friend!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Don’t give me that fucking shit.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Don’t get into it on TV.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Alright, let’s get going!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What are you doin’? You’re gonna lose
everybody!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Where are you goin’?? This ain’t the way to
the station!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jordy…??? Listen to me. You can’t do this.
This isn’t the way to do things.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to
rig the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: My father was. He gave me many lessons about
fire. Now it’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Tommy, take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Don’t you get it? He knew he was gonna get
caught! That’s why he videotaped Eddie’s murder - he thinks he’s gonna
get off.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t stoop to his level!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look, you can’t shoot him in cold blood.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: GET OUTTA HERE NOW!! GET IN THAT CAR AND
DRIVE AWAY!!! DO WHAT I SAY OR I’LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Get your hands up! Get your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You wanna be a real American? Go for your
gun.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Pull the gun! You want to be famous? Shoot
me, you’ll get more headlines and make more money.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: You can’t kill me. You’re not a cop. Just
fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You’ll be my first.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: C’mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look,
you’re sweating. You don’t have the balls.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Get down on your knees.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Where’s your partner?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get
Oleg. He’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Gimme your gun, Jordy. We all want him dead
but you can’t do it this way.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Do you really need me?</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Keep your mouth shut. Don’t mess this up.</p>
<p><strong>hooker’s voice</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: R-room service.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Look at that. See that shot! Seamless. No
cuts. And look. Look at that transition. That’s filmmaking!! Isn’t it
great?!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Drop the girl! Drop her!!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: STOP! STOP THAT MAN!</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Hey, come back here!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Where is he? Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Middle door.</p>
<p><strong>drunk’s voice</strong>: Kill him! Kill the bastard!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Shoot him! SHOOT!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: Look! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Everybody down! Stay DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …and the wild chase through Times Square
ended with the suspect, Oleg Razgul, escaping. The fire department has
identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as Jordy
Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>peter arnett</strong>: In a related matter, Mr. Slovak’s
attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for handling sensational cases - claims
his client is unfit to stand trial.</p>
<p><strong>peter arnett</strong>: In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was
not the alleged mastermind behind the murders. According to Cutler,
Mr. Slovak was being directed by his partner, who threatened to kill him
if he didn’t follow Mr. Razgul’s orders. Cutler told reporters today
that Mr. Razgul did in fact stab his client.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. What’s
happened is not his fault. Emil was under the influence of his partner.
At the trial, you’ll see that my client will be vindicated…</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I brought you some letters. It’s really fan
mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check.
Another wants a check.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: You bring the cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: How’re they treating you, alright I want to
get the cuffs off… but there’s a little bit of a problem. Things out
there are very negative right now for us. We gotta change that around.
Perception is very, very important. Perception is reality. I know you’re
not fuckin’ crazy. But it’s important that I get that message out. Cause
that’s our only defense in this case.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I want you to focus on three things:
fear…</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: …delusions and paranoia.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I was all of these.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Well, you didn’t appreciate the severity of
it until recently. No question about that.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: What about Oleg?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Disappeared. They’re looking everywhere.
Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: No, he is here. Shit…</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Don’t worry about him. Think about
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: What about my movie rights? Book rights?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Look, I haven’t really focused on that kind
of thing.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: What’s your cut? How much?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I would say…half. Half is fair.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: No. No way.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: But it’s…</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another
lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don’t try to negotiate.
Thirty percent. Say yes or no.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: This is not about money, Emil. I need your
trust in me.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: What else do you need?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I need to know about your background. I need
to know about your upbringing. Why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Give me another one, please.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Tell me about yourself. What you did as a
young boy… what your parents were like.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: My father always degraded me. Killed my
self-esteem. And my mother was blind.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Your mother was blind?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She
went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Back in the Czech Republic?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yeah, yeah…bad doctor gave her bad drugs which
made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness…</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Your father blamed you for your mother’s
blindness?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.
Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: That’s what he did to me. He put cigarettes
out on me.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Your father put cigarettes out on you?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Out on my back when I was a small boy.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Can I see your back?</p>
<p><strong>entire back is covered with disgusting purplish welts
from</strong>: CIGARETTE BURNS. Cutler recoils - horrified.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I’m abused. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: I don’t think it’s abuse, I think it’s
torture.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: The public doesn’t have any idea what we do
and now you’re going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney
King!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to
mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a
tree?!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy
was no innocent civilian.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Well this is gonna end your career and
probably mine.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: End my career?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: How are you going to fight this? Maybe if
Oleg hadn’t gotten away and you’d been on the front page, as a hero,
this thing would be easier to fight. You’d have the good to weight
against the bad! It’s unfortunate that I have to make decisions based
upon your press coverage but there’s nothing I can do! Gimme your
shield.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: But Chief? Over this??</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: There’s nothing to talk about. Get a good
lawyer. You’re suspended until your trial.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: I know you got backup at home. Drop it
off.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Look, what don’t you understand? We’ve got a
good relationship with the Czech’s and the State Department doesn’t want
to cause an incident.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: They’ve got her testimony on videotape. And
even if they do take her to court immediately after she’ll be
extradited. The Czechs want her back. She shot a cop! I mean, Christ,
man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic? How
would you feel if the Czechs wouldn’t give them back to us?!</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: And just between us…I was married to a
redhead. They’re a jinx. Redheads are like cross-eyed priests. Stay away
from both.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: You want to see her - go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: We’re gonna fight the extradition.</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Forget about me. You have enough problems of
your own.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: …Do you really want me to forget about
you?</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: I don’t want to drag you down with me.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Daphne, I…</p>
<p><strong>daphne</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: …and today with his partner who he blamed
for the crimes still at large, Emil Slovak will appear in court. His
lawyer will argue that he is mentally unfit to stand trial. Eyewitness
News has also learned that later this month, Jordy Warsaw will himself
be appearing in court. He will be arraigned on charges of violating the
civil rights of…Zwangen…Zwagen…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Zwangendaba.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Goddamn assholes everywhere.
Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba. I got it. I’ll do it. Shit. Let’s start
again. 5-4-3-2-1…</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
descendent of the African King from whom he takes his name…</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Hello? No comment.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Hello? No!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: He robbed you?</p>
<p><strong>zwangendaba</strong>: That’s right, I encountered him right
here. I was just askin’ for change an’ he whips out his big gun an’
pushes me up against that tree, whereupon he takes my money and
handcuffs me to it, leavin’ me there all exposed…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
won’t have to worry about how he is going to pay for his defense. He has
received movie offers and been in conversations with numerous publishers
concerning the rights to his life story.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: I can’t believe this guy got off.
Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Whatever’s leftover, keep.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: He said he’d be here. Pick him up as he
comes through the crowd. Do you hear me? For Chrissakes don’t miss
this.</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: …my client was suffering from a major
illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress,
as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment
of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness… This is a victory for the
mentally ill!</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: …before Emil boards the police boat and
heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I
want to say one last word to you all… As you know, Emil was coerced by
Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the
street, a free man, filming gruesome murders… My client and I hope he is
brought to justice in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: You think this is funny?? What the hell are
you laughing at?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Officer, keep this man back, he’s assaulted
my client on previous occasions.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: This is it? This bastard kills the best cop
this city ever had and we do nothing?</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: You may not like it marshal, but that’s the
law.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: And what about the other victims?? What about
their families? He’ll end up in some country club nuthouse while his
lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do
nothing? We let this scumbag walk?</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Be careful. I can kill you. I’m insane.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I thought you wouldn’t show up. Where is
it? Where is the tape?</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: It’s all in here. All in here.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Wait a minute, Bruce! We’ve got some
interesting evidence, something you should look at!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane!
Hard to believe…watch!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: He knew exactly what he was doing - all of
this was planned! It’s all here in my movie. Emil is not insane. Look.
Look!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: …so we kill someone famous and if we are
caught, we are sent to mental hospital…</p>
<p><strong>cutler</strong>: Officers, there’s your killer, do your duty,
arrest him!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Traitor!!</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I
am director. Action!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Drop the gun! DON’T SHOOT!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I’ll kill her! Back off! Everyone back away
from me!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Let her go. Let her fucking go!!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: No one shoot! Lower your weapons! Do not
fire! No officer will fire his weapon unless I say so! Let the woman
go!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Holster your weapons! Back away. That is an
order! No officers will fire!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Tell him to put his gun down!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Let her go! Let her go!!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: If he doesn’t lower his gun I’ll fucking kill
her.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Shoot! Shoot him!!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: No on shoot! No one shoot!! No officer will
follow. No officer will shoot!</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot him!!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I’ll surrender!! I’ll surrender if he lowers
his gun.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Don’t. Don’t let him surrender. Shoot
him!</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: Let her go. Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Lower your weapon. I told you - lower your
weapon!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I told you not to shoot! No officers should
shoot.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: I’m not a cop. I’m a fire marshal.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: He’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: A film…by Oleg Razgul.</p>
<p><strong>oleg</strong>: How was that?</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Wait a minute. Where are you going? Learn
from Eddie. Talk to the court of public opinion. Take the credit, you
need it.</p>
<p><strong>jordy</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Cut.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Get a shot of him leaving. Then pan to
me.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: Well, he wouldn’t talk to us, but you saw
it.</p>
<p><strong>nicolette</strong>: New York City has a new hero, Fire
Marshal Jordan Warsaw. I hope that Fire Marshal Warsaw’s heroic actions
this afternoon will help with his other legal problems. WB11 has also
learned that the fire Marshal has retained an immigration lawyer to help
Daphne Handlova with her case. We wish her well. This is Nicolette
Karas, live at Battery Park, WB11 New York. Good night.</p>
