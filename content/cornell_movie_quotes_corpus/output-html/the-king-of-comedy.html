<p><strong>mae</strong>: Are you somebody?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No, honey, I’m just a working stiff.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Hi, Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>celeste</strong>: Hello, Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Who did you get?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.</p>
<p><strong>celeste</strong>: He’d never tell you anyway, Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Then I got him again at the Pierre at four
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Be a dear, Mae. I don’t happen to have
Mr. Vallone.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: You know what I want for him.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: But I have only six Barbra’s left. You know
how difficult she is to work with.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: I don’t have her even once.</p>
<p><strong>celeste</strong>: Maybe Rupert would help you.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Would you do that, Rupert? You don’t feel
about Barbra the way I do.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: I’ll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.</p>
<p><strong>celeste</strong>: Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn’t do that sort
of thing.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: How about it, Rupert? I’ll give you whoever
you want.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Rodney Dangerfield … Richard Harris … Liza
Minelli … and she’s not so easy to work with either … Louise Lasser!</p>
<p><strong>celeste</strong>: You’re wasting your time.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Look, Sidney. I’m just not interested. This
isn’t my whole life, you know.</p>
<p><strong>celeste</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean – that it’s my
whole life, or Sidney’s or Mae’s?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: It is so my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>celeste</strong>: Shut up, Mae. What about your mother? Isn’t
she part of your life?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: It’s her whole life too.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: If you want Jerry’s autograph, give me
your piece of paper and I’ll send it backstage.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What are you going to do with Jerry’s
autograph?</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe I’ll sell it.</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: I’ll tell you what she’s going to do with
it. She’s going to pin</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: No, Mae.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: I don’t mean now.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: No, Mae.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: I’ll get right out.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: But I’ve never been in one.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How the hell did that girl get in there?
Jesus, they certainly don’t give you very good protection, do they?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Look at you here. Who the hell is watching
you? Any one of these freaks could just walk right up to you and do
whatever he wants.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Oh, Jerry. How can we get to talk to
you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just a minute. This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Okay! Stand back!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Didn’t you hear me?!? Come on, people, have
a heart.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Stand back! Go ahead, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Thanks. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I hate to bother you like this, Jerry, but
could I speak to you for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’d like to but …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I know you’re a busy man. I promise not to
take very long, really. But I need your advice.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You don’t have a handkerchief, do you?
Jesus, these people will kill you for a cufflink.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I don’t
mind talking as we drive. You can drop me off anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Sorry, but I’ve got a strict rule never to
…</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks, Jerry. I’m grateful for this chance
to talk to you … I hope I’m not boring you.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Really? Fine. I’m Rupert Pupkin, Jerry. I
know that the name itself doesn’t mean very much to you but it means an
awful lot to me, believe me. Maybe you’ve seen me</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Well …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, up to now, I’ve been biding my time,
developing my act slowly and carefully so that when my big break finally
comes, I’m ready – like you were that night Paar got sick and you sat in
for him. I was there that night, in the theater. That was the most
important night of my life, until tonight, of course.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: No thanks. I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Me neither. I just carry them as a courtesy.
How about a cough drop?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: No thanks. I don’t cough.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I try not to but sometimes, you know … Am I
making any sense?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, that night you did Paar, I walked out
of the theater like I was in a dream. All of a sudden, I knew what I
wanted. I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping
them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular
thing. I studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like
you were chatting, and how you delivered</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Look … er … what was the name?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m Rupert, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Look, Rupert. I know what you’re saying.
But things don’t work that way. You can’t just walk onto a network show
without any experience. You’ve got to start at the bottom …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But that’s where I am!</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You’ve got to work your way up, learn your
trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But that can take years, Jerry! Look at me.
I’m already 31 years old! People my age are way ahead of me. I’ve got
some catching up to do and I need your help. What do you say, Jerry? All
I’m asking you to do is listen to my act. That’s all. Is that asking too
much?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I get calls from agents every day. All
they want …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I tried getting an agent. I did, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Look, why don’t you call my office.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Could I?!? Oh, I knew you’d say that, Jerry.
You don’t know how many times I’ve had this conversation in my head. And
this is the way it always turns out. That’s why I had to sort of invite
myself into the car tonight. I know it’s kind of presumptuous and I
really appreciate the time you’ve given me. But breaks like this don’t
just happen. You have to make your own breaks.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Nice meeting you, Rupert. I hope it all
works out for you.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks, Jerry. I don’t know how to repay
you. I’m a little short on cash this evening, but, if you don’t mind
some good, hearty food, I’d be honored to take you to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Thanks, but some people are waiting for
me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could
repay you with a joke.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Wait a minute. How’s this? The first night
you do your show from the coast, you open this way. “Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen, it’s great to be back here in</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Not bad. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry! How about
lunch? My treat!</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Call my office.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Langford. How did you get
in?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: That’s alright, Vincent. Mr. Pupkin’s a
friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s alright. Now if you’d be good enough
to find us a nice table.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Certainly. This way, please.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Here you are. Enjoy your lunch,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Is Eddie here today, Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll send him over.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua
a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sounds like a new opera.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Fine. What comes with it?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Fine. For two.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You look tired, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: It shows, does it? It’s all these problems
with the show. That and the custody suit.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I was sorry to read about that, Jerry.
Charlene never should have gotten the kids. If there’s anything I can
do.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about
it a little with you helps.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Hasn’t Eddie already done you?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Never mind. You were saying …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to
your situation, Jerry, ever since I saw you starting to lose ground in
the ratings. And I think I know what the problem is. Too many of the
same faces.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure, people are getting tired of these
people who live off game shows and talk shows and can’t really do
anything. They’ve seen ’em and heard ’em till they can’t stand it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You know, maybe you’re right, Rube.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m sure I am. When a show runs out of
surprises, it loses its audience.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’s your name, dear?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Dolores.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: To Dolores, who sensed greatness. Rupert
Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You see what I mean? What you need on the
show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant talent making his
television debut. Imagine the suspense. Who is this young guy? How will
he do with the eyes of all America on him? Something like that has got
to help.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: And that’s where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why not? Believe me, Jerry, I’d give you the
credit you deserve and I’ll stick with you. Anytime you need me, I’ll be
there, doing a few minutes at Guild scale.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’d be grateful, Rube. I really would.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All finished, Mr. Langford.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, Jerry, you sneaky …</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Looks good, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Compliments of Mr. Sardi.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin’s voice</strong>: How does your afternoon look?</p>
<p><strong>langford’s voice</strong>: What have you got in mind?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin’s voice</strong>: Well, we’ve still got time to catch
the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.</p>
<p><strong>langford’s voice</strong>: Why not? But first, a toast. To
you, Rube and your success.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin’s voice</strong>: Thanks, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Say hello to Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Say hello to Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: It’s Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my
note? I left it on the back seat. Did you get it? I dropped it there
before they pulled me out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Who gave you this number?</p>
<p><strong>marsha’s voice</strong>: Don’t be angry with me, Jerry. I
didn’t know what else to do; I’ve been trying you every five minutes, I
miss you, baby … Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Miss!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: A beer please, Miss. Something imported.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Heineken’s alright?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How have you been, Rita?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re not Rupert Pupkin!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How the hell did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee.
Aren’t you glad to see me?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Sure, sure. How is old Sally?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: The same, I guess. You know, two kids, a
nice husband, living in Clifton.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It figures.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: A lot of the kids in our class have moved
back.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I just thought I’d say hello. Here, I
brought you a little something.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Don’t forget to put in an aspirin. It lasts
longer.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Nothing’s gonna keep it alive in this
place.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How have you been, dear, sweet Rita?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t have an aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Maybe a Rolaids would work.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, what are you up to these days,
Rupert?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Didn’t you know you’d see me again?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You still going to the movies?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You’re looking as beautiful as ever.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, yeah. I was a real knockout.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, here I am. Local cheerleader makes
good.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I voted for you for Most Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I didn’t have the nerve to tell you then,
but I guess it’s alright now.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, nothing terrible’s gonna happen, if
that’s what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, how are things with you, Rupert?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Great! Everything’s starting to break.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yeah. As a matter of fact, that’s why I’m
here. I’ve known about this place for a long time. I just didn’t want to
make my move until I had something to offer you. Everything’s a question
of timing.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: The two of us are often confused. He’s the
one with the famous father.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You like this place?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Why, you got something better?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You call me up all junior and senior year.
Night after night after night, right? And every time I’m wondering ‘when
is this guy going to stop talking and ask me out?’ Well, now I know the
answer. August twelfth, nineteen seventy-six. It only took you ten,
eleven years to work up to it.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: If I had asked you out? Would you have
gone?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Because I thought you were a jerk!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You see! I was right! But that guy isn’t me
anymore. I look at my picture in the yearbook and I don’t even recognize
myself. I’m not the same guy, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Excuse me a minute, honey.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m not honey! I’m Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Miss! Miss!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m in the mood to celebrate tonight. Why
don’t we go to this nice restaurant I know, talk over and times, get to
know each other all over again.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, tomorrow night I thought we’d go out
again, talk some more, get to know each other even better.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How much what?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How much do we have to get to know each
other?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How much do we have to get to know each other
before we start talking about that job?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m not talking about any job.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Then what’s this big offer you were talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You’ll see. Right now I’m asking you for a
date. How about it?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m sorry, Rupert. But I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Busy?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah. Busy.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But this is the biggest night of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ve already got a date.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Miss! Miss!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Is that your date?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What do you want to go out with him for?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: He’s a good friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Tell him you’re busy.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s so important about tonight?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Everything! You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No. I don’t. It’s been really nice seeing you,
Rupert. Thanks for dropping in. But I’ve got some work to do.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Miss!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Listen to me for a second.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I have work to do, Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just listen. I’m at the start of something
really big. I don’t want to talk about it here but it’s going to happen
soon and it’s going to be great – for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: So see that guy some other night.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But I haven’t finished!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Miss! Miss!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ll get you another one.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Miss! Miss!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: C’mon, schmuck, wake up so I can kick your ass
outta here.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: He was making trouble one minute and the next
he was on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Okay, buddy, here we go.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Another one, Chan.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Chopsticks, please.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: So all this time you’ve been thinking about
me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s right, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What kinds of things were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, ho! Those kinds of things! Shame on you,
Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, Rita. People will hear.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh, come
on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: This is a very important evening to me,
Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Did you know your nose wiggled when you
talked?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: It does?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit. Hey, are we
gonna eat or what? I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It always looks like they put worms in this
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just taste.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, I guess it won’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese
cuisine in the city.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah? Then what happened to the
tablecloths?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, don’t worry about it. This is</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I used to see you at the Garden every
year.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for
’em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens.
What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was
gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny
Penny.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You just didn’t get the breaks.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn’t have the
money for the right coach. But what difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I remember once we were down in Atlanta and
the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was
falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow
like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I liked the show.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been
carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I
got married?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I knew it wouldn’t last.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You think I should have married you, instead,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Peter Drysdale! Really, Rita!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Are you seeing anyone?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I want to know about the competition, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, tomorrow night, I’ve got a date with Joe
Namath – you know Joe. And Thursday — let’s see –</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m serious, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m serious, Rita. Sure I see people. I’m not
a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Anyone special?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You mean am I “going steady”? Rupert, I’m
thirty-one years old!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What about that guy tonight?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why him?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home
watching TV? He’s just some guy. He’s got his own aluminum siding
business. He comes into the city sometimes, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You don’t go out with him for his
money?!?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think
they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don’t get the
world’s greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of
me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s what I want to talk to you about,
Rita.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Who’s your favorite movie star?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You are, Rupert. Especially your nose.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just tell me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is this some kind of game? Are you going to
tell me something about my character?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You’ll see. Give me his name.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I can’t think of anybody.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You’ve got to have one, Rita. Everybody
does.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay. Okay. Let’s see. Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, Rupert! Are we going to exchange</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s her name.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Her name! She signed this herself,
especially for me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: She wasn’t a great actress but she had a
real gift for comedy. She died tragically, you know, alone, like so many
of the world’s most beautiful women. I’m going to see that doesn’t
happen to you, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Who’s this one?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes. Who’s
this?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Mel Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Carol Burnett.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No kidding. How about this?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Glenda Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Never heard of her.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: And that’s Woody Allen and there’s</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You don’t really know any of these people?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I can’t make it out.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Try.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is really weird handwriting!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Rooooper ….</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Redford!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s Robert Redford.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: No! It’s … it’s Rupert Pupkin</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Don’t lose it. It’s going to be worth
something in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.
Things are really breaking for me. I’m ticketed for stardom.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Only a couple of hours ago, I was talking to
Jerry Langford, the Jerry Langford. Stop it, Rita!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: We were talking about my doing my act on his
show.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Your act?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Get that guy you knew from Clifton out of
your head right now. You’re looking at Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert
Pupkin, the new King of Comedy.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why not me, Rita? A guy can always get what
he wants if he’s willing to pay the price. All it takes is a little
talent and sacrifice and the right break. If you’ve got a friend in the
right place, that’s all it takes. And that’s exactly what I have going
for me right now. After all, crazier things have happened.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You just don’t realize what a shot on the
Langford Show can mean. That’s coast to coast, national TV, a bigger
audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a lifetime. A
shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit – Flip Wilson
one week, Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or Carol Burnett. And
you’ve always got those other talk shows to fall back on – Carson,
Griffin. And all that leads straight in one direction, Rita – Hollywood!
That’s when we really start</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I really hope
you get what you want. But it’s getting late and I’m a working girl. You
know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You going to spend the rest of your life in
that place? Is that what you really want, talking about nothing with
nothings? I thought you wanted something a little better than that and
that’s what I’m offering. Every King needs a Queen, Rita. I want you to
be mine. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You really want to help me out? You see this.
A hundred seventy-five bucks. If you could spare fifty, say, until next
Monday, that would keep three people really happy – me, my landlord and
my dentist.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Telephone for you, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Me? Nobody knows I’m here. You didn’t tell
anybody, did you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Who do you think it is? I’ve been
staring at you all evening.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You know who that was – the bar. I have to go
back to work.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How did they know you were here?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I guess I must have told them. They need
someone right away.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You don’t even care, do you?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, no. I do. Really!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: It’s not the bar, Rita. Don’t tell me it’s
the bar.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on. Let’s see a smile.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why don’t we finish the evening up at the
bar together? End the evening where it began?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: After what happened there?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, I could at least drop you off!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s okay. Really. I can manage. Why don’t
you just go to a movie or something? Don’t let me spoil your
evening.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But that wouldn’t be right.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Look, Rupert. It’s been a lot of fun, really.
I’ll see you sometime, huh?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But Rita!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on, Rupert. I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Welcome to the pleasure dome.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You don’t kid around, do you?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I do alright. What’s your libation?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Your potion. Your drink.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Bourbon and soda. Make it light.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You from the South?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: That’s what Southern people drink. Lots
of bourbon.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What do people from Jersey drink?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I make it a point to study things like
that. It’s important to know people’s backgrounds, their tastes, their
culture. It gives you a little head start.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m Chet. Whom do I have the pleasure of
serving?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m Mary.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Pleased to meat you, Mary. To our
evening.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Rita Keane. I want to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Rita Keane?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s right. Oh, never mind. I must have
the wrong apartment.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: There’s no Rita here.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I know. I know. I’m sorry to bother you.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You must have the wrong
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Leisure is America’s fastest growing
industry. Did you know that? Think about it. Short work weeks, more
vacation. People need something to do with all that time and that’s
where I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc. We buy land an hour or so
outside your metropolitan centers. We set up the bungalows, dig some
lakes, lay out a golf course, you know, fix the whole place up so it’s
usable. Then young, personable guys like me show the people around. It
the guy seems tight, we point out the investment factor. If he’s a
swinger, well, the bungalows are very private. If he’s a sports nut, we
talk up skiing and fishing and tennis.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What’s your work, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Me. I fly for National.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Sandalwood incense. It seemed very
you.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I said I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Did you know that you have remarkable
hair?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah? You know what? I feel like going to a
movie.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Sure. Why not? It’s only twenty of ten. We can
make a ten o’clock show.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Why don’t we make our own movie?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Don’t be so uptight. Give it a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I want to go to the movies, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: We can go to the movies later.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Let’s stop playing games, okay. I’m not a
kid.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You have something against pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Shall I freshen up your drink?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What exactly did you think we were going
to do up here?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Look, if you’ve got sexual problems let’s
talk about them. It helps clear the air.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with me.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Then it’s me?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t even know you.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Then find out. Sex is a great way of
breaking down barriers.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m sure this could lead to something
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Passive resistance, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Let’s just write this thing off as a big
mistake. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Nothing. I just want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I can see I’m not turning you on.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You noticed that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Come on. What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You really want to know?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How can I put it? Well, it’s like you’ve got
your fly open and your tongue hanging out.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m really a very sensitive person.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on. Get offa me.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Sometimes I write poetry.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: So you wanna play hard to get, huh?</p>
<p><strong>old lady’s voice</strong>: � Que es, por favor?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on. Let’s talk this over.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I admire you very much. I respect you,
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re hurting me.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m only doing what you want.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Afterwards, you’ll thank me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Don’t be angry with me. I was worried about
you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Just go home and leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Here. You’ll need this. It’s getting
chilly.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m so bad. I’m such a dummy.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Don’t say that, Rita. Everyone does crazy
things.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Not all the time.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’ll get us a cab.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext</strong>: WEST 56th STREET BETWEEN EIGHTH AND NINTH
AVENUES -</p>
<p><strong>cab driver’s voice</strong>: Stuff it, big spender!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, I guess you’re entitled to come up for
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s okay, Rita. You’re tired and I know
I’m not always the easiest guy to be with.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What do you want, Rupert?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You don’t understand anything, do you? I
love you, Rita. I want to change your life … if you’ll only give me a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Look, what if I arranged it so you could
meet Jerry? You’d have to believe me if you heard it from him.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: There’s no …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’ll arrange that, Rita. We’ll all go out to
dinner some night or maybe out to his place, on a weekend. You’ll see.
The trouble with you is you’ve got no faith. Now go to bed and get a
good rest and I’ll see you in a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Now run along in.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>33 ext</strong>: MADISON AVENUE AND 48th STREET - DAY</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I need somebody to sign. You can sign
anything you want – Cary Grant, Art Carney, I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Would you mind very much if I used your
phone? It’s local.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Don’t be, long. Dial nine.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: May I speak to Jerry Langford, please?
Thanks … Jerry Langford, please. Rupert Pupkin … Jerry knows. I’m
calling at his request … I see. That’s alright. I’ll call him again.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: That’s not Jerry Langford, the …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Jerry Langford, please … May I speak to
Jerry Langford, please … Rupert Pupkin, I called earlier … I see. How
long do you expect that’ll last? Oh, fine. I’m at CH 4-1482 … I’ll be
here for another half hour, forty- five minutes. Please be sure he gets
my message. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Yes sir?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Mr. Langford, please.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You know the secret of dieting, Jerry?
Grapefruit. It’s good for you. It’s filling. And it’s low in
calories.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Take note of that, you ladies.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: As a matter of fact, yesterday I went to the
outdoor market near where I live and I bought twenty grapefruit. The
grocer looked at me and said, “What are you gonna do with all those?” So
I bent over and told him “I’m gonna take ’em back to Florida and set ’em
free!”</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Pupkin, but
Mr. Langford’s secretary has no record of any appointment.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mr. Langford’s secretary has no record
of any appointment.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, technically speaking, I don’t actually
have an appointment. Jerry asked me to call him today and when I
couldn’t get through, I thought …</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I see. He says Mr. Langford asked him
to call. Mr. Langford’s secretary wants to know what this is in
reference to.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Would you mind talking to her
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Hello? … Jerry and I discussed my being on
the show last night and he told me to call … No. I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m supposed to wait.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Who was that gentleman?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mr. Gangemi.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, I see. Mr. Gangemi.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: He takes care of our air
conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Uh … Mr. Pupkin?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: I’m Cathy Long.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m Mr. Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m sorry, but you are?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: I’m Bert Thomas’ assistant.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Bert Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: He’s our executive producer.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, yes. I’m sure he is. But, you see, I’ve
already talked directly with Jerry about my being on the show and he
told me to get in touch with him. I’m just here to follow up on
that.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: What do you do, Mr. Pupkin?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Fine. Where are you working?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, right now I’m developing new
material.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: I see. Well, as soon as you start
performing again, let us know where you are and I’ll send my assistant
down to check you out.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure. Sure. But that’s not necessary, Miss
Long. Jerry and I already went over all this.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Does Jerry know your work?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yes. I don’t think he does.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: You don’t happen to have a tape or a
demo that we might listen to?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, sure. I’ve got lots of tapes. That’s no
problem.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Good. Why don’t you just send one to us
and I assure you we’ll listen to it promptly.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Great. I’ll do that. I can see that’d be a
lot easier for Jerry. Thanks a lot, Miss Long.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Don’t mention it, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if
you’d excuse me …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure. Sure. Thanks again.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I’ve got to speak to you for a minute. I’m
Marsha.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yeah. I know.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Look. Did Jerry say anything about me last
night?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m really in a hurry, Marsha …</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Was he angry? … In the car last night, I saw
you. Did he talk about me?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I thought that was you. That was some
stunt.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: We didn’t talk about you.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: You know Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Give him this for me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why don’t you …</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Because I can’t! Please. I need your help.
You’ll be my friend forever. Come on. I’ll buy you something. What do
you want?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I don’t want this.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Take it. I can get all I want.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Okay. I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Don’t try. Do it. Remember. We just made a
deal.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: And don’t open it. It’s private.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: How soon can you get it to him?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I don’t know. Couple a days.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: You’d better.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: gave him. There are wads of tens, twenties
and fifties with a sprinkling of fives and ones.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Testing. Testing. Testing.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: First, Miss Long. Thanks very much for your
help at the office and for passing this along to Jerry. I appreciate it
more than you know.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just want to
thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that
you’ve given me. You know, lots of people think that guys like you, you
know, people who have made it, lose their feeling for struggling</p>
<p><strong>bert canter’s voice</strong>: And now, direct from New York,
it’s the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight, with Jerry’s special guest …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: … the comedy find of the year making his
television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the King of Comedy!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Now you come on, Jerry, and do your
monologue. Then, when the time comes, this is how I see you introducing
me. You’ll say something like this. “Ladies and Gentlemen we’re going to
do something a little bit different tonight. It isn’t often that you can
call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the
verdict is always in your hands. But I think after you’ve met my next
guest, that you’ll agree with me that he’s destined for greatness. So,
now, will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest King of
Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!”</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Will somebody tell that lovely lady that the
applause sign is off.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s a possible introduction, Jerry. Now
let’s move on to my act.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I didn’t want to take any chances with this
… uh … Miss Long, so I … uh … thought I’d just bring it here myself.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: We talked about this this morning, did
we, Mr. … ?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Oh, yes. It’s been some day. Well, I
certainly appreciate your bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and we’ll
listen to it as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Fine. Er … you don’t have any idea how soon
that might be?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Well, you can try checking with us
tomorrow. We might know something by then. Otherwise, it’ll have to be
Monday.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What if I just sort of waited around here
today, just in case? I’ll stay out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: You’d just be wasting your time,
Mr. Pupkin. We won’t know anything until tomorrow at the earliest.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t consider it a waste of</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Look, why don’t you try us tomorrow.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Tomorrow? … Right. I’ll do that. Thanks a
lot, Miss Long. And thank Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Dynamite! This is dynamite!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You think so, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Look, I’ve been at this for fifteen years,
Rupert, and I haven’t come up with anything like this – not me, not any
of my writers.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, I’m glad you like it, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Tell me something, Rube. How do you do it?
I’m not asking to use the material myself. I just want to know how you
how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, I don’t know if I can explain it,
really.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Come on. Try, Rube.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Is that what you do? The worst parts, and
then you look at them in a funny light? Is that what you do?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: More or less. It’s hard to describe how its
happens.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: But that’s just it, Rube. It doesn’t
happen for me. Why do you think the show is in so much trouble? By the
time I’ve done my monologue, everyone has switched to Carson. Maybe if
you did a little writing … ?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure, Jerry, I’d do anything I could to help
out.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You would? Great. Why don’t you come out
to my place this weekend and we’ll hash it out. I’m having a few of my
friends but we should be able to get a little work in.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Would you mind if I brought someone?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: A girl, Rube?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: A very special girl, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’d love to meet her.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Cab, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: That’s alright, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing and juggle
at the same time. How about puttin’ him on your show?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: How about it, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Sorry, I’m off duty.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re Jerry!!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You know something. I undress in front of you
every night and Larry here doesn’t mind at all.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can’t get anything started with her until
you’re off the air. Your show is ruining my sex life, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Well then, you’ll just have to put on a
better show than I do.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Jerry! God damnit!</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Yes, sir? Oh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Hi. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’d like to see Jerry, please.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You are … ?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Mr. Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mr. Pupkin is here … That’s right …
She’ll be with you in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Miss Long.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But I wanted to see Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mr. Langford’s not in. Miss Long will
take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Mr. Pupkin?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for your
tape. We listened to it with great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin,
we saw a lot of good things in what you’re doing. We feel you have good
potential. Very good potential.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: That’s why I’ll be honest with you,
Mr. Pupkin …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: We just don’t think you’re ready
yet.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Not ready?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Well, we just don’t feel right now that
you’re right for Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Right for Jerry. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Some of the material … some of the
one-liners, for instance …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: … were not very strong.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You didn’t care for some of the jokes, is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: That”s right.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Good. Good. I can take care of that right
way. Thanks. Just tell me the ones you think should go. That would be a
big help. This is great. Which ones?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Well, it’s not just that, Mr. Pupkin.
You see, Jerry likes to panel his guests, you know, chat with them
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: And frankly, we just don’t feel you’ve
got very much to talk about right now.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But I’ve got my whole life to talk
about!</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Which is interesting to you, I’m sure
and to your wife … and to a few friends. But we feel that you should
keep developing your act. Test it in some live situations. There are a
number of clubs in the city you can</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: May I ask you a question, Miss Long?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Are you speaking for Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Let’s put it this way, Mr. Pupkin.
Mr. Langford has complete faith in our judgment.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m sorry to have to say this, Miss Long,
and I certainly don’t want you to take it personally, but I have to tell
you that I don’t … I don’t have faith in your judgment.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: Well, I’m sorry you feel that way,
Mr. Pupkin. But I’m afraid there’s nothing that can be done about
that.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: No … No … I’m afraid I’ll have to disagree
with you again.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: That’s your privilege, Mr. Pupkin. Now,
if you’ll excuse me, please, I have some things to do. I’m sorry the
news isn’t better.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Miss Long?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: When are you expecting Jerry in?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: He won’t be in until very late this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Is there anyone else you would like to
see?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s alright. I’m happy just waiting.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Well, would you mind waiting outside,
please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception area, not a waiting room.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Mr. Pupkin? I’m Raymond Wirtz, in charge
of security for the Langford organization.</p>
<p><strong>wirtz</strong>: Now I think you understand that we have
certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our
operation.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>wirtz</strong>: And that without these rules, we really
wouldn’t be able to function at our best. You follow my point?</p>
<p><strong>wirtz</strong>: Now one of these rules is that only
authorized personnel and those having official business with our
organization are permitted on our premises. And that’s why I’m asking
you, Mr. Pupkin, to cooperate with us.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You want me to leave the building.</p>
<p><strong>wirtz</strong>: That’s right. It’s nothing personal,
Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>wirtz</strong>: Have a pleasant day.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Well, did you give it to him?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Did you get my letter to him?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: He’s not in there.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Look, if you don’t want to give it him,
okay. I’ll get somebody else. But don’t try to con me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I told you I’d try and I will. I’m going to
wait for him right here.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Give me the envelope, huh?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure, but …</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I saw him go in myself!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But they said he wasn’t in.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Just give me the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: When did he go in?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Ten minutes ago! That’s when.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Look, I saw him my …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: And he hasn’t come out?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I’ve been standing right here. Now how about
it?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I’m staying right here!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Tell Jerry Langford I’m here, please.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. Mr. Langford’s not
in.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I happen to know he is. So would you</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’m sorry. He’s not in.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You’re putting your job on the line,
lady.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Jerry! Jerry! You’re going the have a hell
of a lot of explaining to do! Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>wirtz</strong>: You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Jerry! Help me. Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>wirtz</strong>: If we see your face again, Mr. Pupkin, we’ll
call the police.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Start looking for a new job!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Does he have it?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll get it to him.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Yeah? When?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: This weekend. He asked me to go out there,
to his house.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Look, I told you, I’ve got some work to
discuss with him. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: But what about me?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s fine, but while you two are talking,
what am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You can chat with the other guests.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m sure they’ll be thrilled hearing about the
wonderful world of draft beer. Let’s tell ’em I’m a model, okay?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: If they ask what I do, let’s just say I model.
You don’t mind pretending just a little, do you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: If it make you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is a gas! Too bad nobody’ll believe it.
After you guys are done working, what happens? Are we going out
someplace, or what?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m sure Jerry has something arranged.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What do these people do for fun? Do they party
or do freaky things or just get drunk or … I mean, What do they do?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I guess they just sit around and talk and
enjoy each other’s company, like anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Talk?!? What can you talk about for three or
four hours?!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What do you mean? They’ve got plenty to talk
about. They do things. All kinds of interesting things happen to them
and then they talk about them. What do you think Jerry’s show is all
about?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks. That’s
what all those shows are. At least they help you get to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Boy, this is going to be some great weekend. I
thought we were gonna have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just take it easy, Rita. Everything’s going
to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, you have no idea how bad it’s gotten in
New York. Now the muggers are so efficient that, each time they jump
you, they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list. And
once you’re on the list, you’re in real trouble, like this friend of
mine who was mugged thirty-two times on his way home from work.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: So what my friend does is get himself a dog,
one of those huge German Shepherds. One night, he’s walking the dog in
Central Park when he hears this voice behind him. Okay, Harry, drop your
vallet and keep your hantz over your head or I bite your little fanny
off.</p>
<p><strong>one guest</strong>: Looks like you’ve found yourself a
winner, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: He’s the one who found himself a
winner.</p>
<p><strong>a second guest</strong>: Have you set a date?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>a third guest</strong>: I hope we’re all invited.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Everyone’s invited.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: We are met here in these extraordinary
circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock. But,
before we begin, let me voice a personal word of thanks to you, Rupert
and to you, Rita, for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony.
Because we are on prime time, I am going to discard my customary remarks
in favor of a few personal reflections. When I was principal at Clifton
High and these two were students, I had very little faith that Rupert
here would amount to very much. But like his teachers and his fellow
students, I underestimated this fine young man. Some say that this
misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the
Clifton School System. But let me take this opportunity to set the
record straight. Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: We’ll be back to marry them in a minute,
right after this word.</p>
<p><strong>conductor’s voice</strong>: Greenwich. Greenwich next stop.
Greenwich.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Look at that one. How’d you like to live in
that?!?! Or that one! What do you figure these run?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s gorgeous!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Look, friend, I wouldn’t want to tell you
how many times I made this trip. That’ll be three seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Thanks. If you need a ride back, just ask
the guy for Wayne. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You must be Jonno. I’m Rupert Pupkin and
this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford’s expecting us.</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: Mr. Langford asked you to come?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s right. Would you mind taking those
up? Jerry and I have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight.</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: But Mr. Langford’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Out playing golf, right?</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Maybe he’ll finally break a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: Maybe it’s better if you came back …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s alright. We don’t mind waiting.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: The table’s only set for one.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s from breakfast. Relax, will you?</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: Let me talk to Jerry Langford please … I know
he is … It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I could live here.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: It’s the only way to live.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How come he isn’t here?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You heard the guy. He’s out playing
golf.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Didn’t you tell him when we’d get here?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: We didn’t have time to iron out the details.
Now just relax. We’re the first guests, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That Jonno character hadn’t even heard of
us!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: It probably slipped Jerry’s mind. He has
better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s just not time way I expected it, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: These are Jerry’s parents. His father runs
the Post office in Wolverine – that’s in North Dakota.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: This one was in Newsweek. He started giving
these puppet shows when he was still in grade school.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: And this is from his quiz show in St. Louis.
Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Sure I can.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That was the name of the show.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: And here’s when he wrote for Jack Paar. He
made a hundred and fifty a week and look at him now.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: And this is his morning show.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: And his kids. He’s divorced.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Look at this. I love these kind of things.
Look at the work. I’ve got this thing about boxes.</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: Mr. Langford? … I’m sorry to disturb you
…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How much longer are we gonna have to wait?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I don’t know. Until he gets back.</p>
<p><strong>rita.</strong>: Do we have to just sit here?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: He should be back pretty soon.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Doesn’t he have any music or anything? Let’s
get a little life into this place. It’s like a funeral parlor.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is more like it.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on, yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How about a little spin, handsome?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on, Rupert. I came up here for a good
time.</p>
<p><strong>sinatra’s voice</strong>: The way you wore your hat, The way
we danced till three, The memory of all that – Oh no, they can’t take
that away from me, No … they can’t take that away … from … me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You never could dance, could you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: How would you know?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh I danced with you a couple of times – at
the Sigma U party.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You were there with Tommy Winston.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You didn’t ask me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s the one time I did ask you and you
went with him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, I couldn’t go with you!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Be serious, Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, it’s all ended happily and that’s what
counts.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I wonder what the rest of this place looks
like?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m sure it’s all very nice.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, there’s only one way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You coming or not?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, Rita. This isn’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What are you doing, Rita?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I love it! All those millions of women out
there dying to change places with me right now.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on. We shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Relax, will you. Let me have a little fun, for
Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Look at this. It’s nicer than my whole
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Let’s go, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Boy, I really need some sun.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Rita, this is Jerry’s …</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Lay off, will you, Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But we have no right …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That wasn’t funny, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Now for something that smells nice.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: I was going to call the police but then I
thought to myself ‘what if they are Mr. Langford’s friends?’</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Hi, Jerry. We were just freshening up.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Jerry, I’d like you to meet Rita Keane.
Rita, say hello to Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’s your pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: We’ve already taken the liberty, so to
speak. Rita was a little nervous. It isn’t every day she meets someone
like you.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: We’ve been sitting around, waiting. That’s
all. How was your golf game?</p>
<p><strong>jonno</strong>: I told them you weren’t here.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: He did, Jerry. He was very helpful. We had
to take an early train. There was nothing else until after one. I
brought the material. It’s upstairs, in my bags. Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: The other guests! We’re getting a little
hungry, to tell you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But we don’t mind waiting, do we, Rita?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You know, I could have you arrested, both
of you.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You know you could! And there’d be
absolutely no way we could prove we belonged here. I never thought of
that.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Well, you should have before you …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Maybe we could work up a routine about that,
about a guy who throws all his friends in jail. Let’s talk about
that.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Let’s not.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure, Jerry. Whatever you …</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Look, if you’ve got something for me to
sign, let’s have it and get it over with so I can get back …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That wouldn’t be right, Jerry. Not in your
own house!</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I have a lot of work to get to. How did
they get here?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: We took a taxi, Jerry … But don’t worry
about us. You go ahead and do your work and we’ll just take a stroll
around until lunch is ready.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You’re a little thick, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Well, maybe a …</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s he’s saying, Rupert, is that he wants
us out.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Don’t listen to her, Jerry. She doesn’t
understand anything about us.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Don’t get me into this.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Call the station.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: There’ll be a cab here in a few minutes.
Now if you’ll just wait at the gate …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Look, Jerry, if I’ve said anything out of
line, let’s chalk it up to inexperience, okay? I’ll just go upstairs and
get my tape and we can start working. It shouldn’t take long and then
you’ll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’ve told you just as clearly as I can. I
want you out of here and I want you out now. Scram, beat it, vamoose,
out! Is that plain enough!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But what about my material? When are we
going to go over it?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on, Rupert, the man wants us to go.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Tell her she’s wrong, Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Look, Mr. Langford. I didn’t know anything
about all this. I hardly know this guy. I haven’t seen him in years.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: So if there’s anything I can do, any way I can
make this up to you.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: She’s nothing, Jerry. She’s just some girl
who works in a bar. Don’t let her spoil things.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Come on. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: All I’m asking is fifteen minutes. That’s
all. Just long enough to listen to my act. Is that asking too much –
fifteen minutes of your day against my whole life?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’ll call the police if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I have my own life, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: But what about me, Jerry? What about my
life? I made plans – based on what you said. You can’t just turn your
back on me.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’m not telling you again.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: So this is the way it works when you’re big,
huh? You just play with people. Is that part of the kick, Jerry? I can
see I was all wrong about you. All wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on, Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Shut up! You weren’t my friend at all, were
you? You were just playing some kind of game with me. Well, that’s not
going to stop me, Jerry. I’m just going to work a little bit harder,
that’s all, use a little bit more enterprise. And not count on anybody.
That’s where I made my mistake. I can see that now.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, Rita. We’re wasting our time.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What did you think was going to happen? You
think he’d just … ? What’s the matter with you? You can’t just walk into
a guy’s house! And what about me? What did you …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Shut up, Rita. I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: How much longer?!?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Do you want him or not?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: You sure he’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Certain.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: My parents are going to be furious!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: It looks real.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s the whole point. with his head
towards the entrance of the building which is some 50 yards Pay
attention.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: What if he doesn’t come down?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: He will.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: But what if he doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: We’ll come back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: And wait again?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Look, you’re going to have him all to
yourself. What else do you want?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Sure I’m sure. That looks too much like
him.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: When it’s him it doesn’t look like him.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Keep watching.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Wait a second and follow him.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: What about here?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Too busy. Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Go past him and stop.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just keep walking or I’ll kill you right
here.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I said keep walking. This is a gun in my
pocket and I’ve got nothing to lose.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just keep walking and don’t talk to anybody.
I’ll tell you what to do.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Get in!</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Look, this is …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just shut up and get in.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Hi, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I didn’t like being so rough out there,
Jerry. But I wanted you to know that I meant business. I didn’t want
anything happening to you over some misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Now I know you’re wondering what this is all
about. Actually you’ve got nothing to worry about. You just do what I
tell you and by, say, midnight, you’ll be safe and out of here. Of
course if you try anything clever, I’ll kill you – or Marsha will. She
knows how to use this too.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You realize what you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, Jerry. This isn’t a spur</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Now, you’re going to call your office and
tell them this: that unless a man who identifies himself as the King is
allowed on the show tonight as the first guest, they’ll never see you
alive again.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’ll say it again …</p>
<p><strong>thomas’ secretary</strong>: Bert Thomas! … He’s in a meeting,
Mr. Langford … I see.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He says it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yeah? Well, tell him I’ll call him back.
It’s that Martino kid, the impressionist.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Then try again!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yeah? … Okay, Martino, let’s stop the
bullshit … what? … Okay, I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Give me that again? … Wait a minute. What do
we call our second cameraman?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Helen Keller.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: No tricks, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Don’t do anything, Jerry. Stay right there.
Tell him we’ll do anything he wants. Tell him to cool it. Are you okay?
… Look, tell him to call us about five, okay. We’ll let him know what to
do. And don’t do anything stupid.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Vivien!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Get me the number of the F.B.I. right away.
And get me Crockett’s office. And keep your mouth shut about this.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Looks fine.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I had to guess on the sleeves. He gets to
keep it, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure, if he isn’t dead.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I know he’s in a meeting and I don’t care.
I’ve got to talk to him! … No, he can not call me back. Don’t you
understand? This is an emergency</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: This wasn’t an easy decision for me, Jerry,
believe me. For one thing, I knew it meant we could never be friends
again and that hurt me. It’s hard to lose a friend, even one who has let
you down. You always hope you can patch things up. You know, a guy like
me doesn’t make friends that easily.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Why didn’t you just listen to the tape when
I asked you? Then I wouldn’t have to be doing all this. Was it really
too much to expect – a few minutes of your time to listen to something
I’d worked on my whole life?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Hey, if that’s what’s bothering you, let’s
go over to my office and listen to that tape right now.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know what would
happen to me?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Am I going to have to hold this thing all
day?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just keep it on him. You know, Jerry.
Friendship is a two- way street. All that time I was worrying about you
and your ratings and everything, you couldn’t have cared less about
me.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: You’re right. You know that? I was
thoughtless. It’s just that when you’re doing a big show, it’s hard to
tell who your friends really are. I was wrong. I apologize. Why don’t we
just shake hands and forget the whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s easy to say, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: But I mean it. I’ll tell them that the
whole thing was a joke and then we can go to my office and listen to
that tape. Come on. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I said sit!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’s the matter? You heard what he
said.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: All of a sudden, with a gun on him, he wants
to make up and be friends. And, once he’s out the door, what happens
then?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What happens then, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: You get to his office and they jump you,
that’s what happens, Rupert.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: She’s right, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Not if I tell them not to. This is Jerry,
Rupert, I give you my word.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: He gives me his word.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Yeah? And what else? Come on, Rupert, I’m
sick of waiting.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: And what else, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Come on, Rupert. My word’s good enough,
isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: No, Jerry. It’s not. Keep the gun up!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m sorry to do it this way, Jerry, but I’m
no good at knots. Just put your arms up and out, okay?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Oh, no, Jerry. None of that. Now hold
still.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Look, I tell you, the bureau is doing
everything possible to locate Mr. Langford. Right now our men are out
checking out every radical group in this city.</p>
<p><strong>an executive</strong>: Radical?</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: They’re willing to sacrifice their leader in
order to get their message across, aren’t they? You’ve got to figure
that this is a desperate outfit. I don’t know who they are anymore than
you do. But I do know I’ve got to stop them. Otherwise, what you’re
seeing here is just the first of a whole wave of these kinds of
kidnappings.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Does this mean we’re not supposed to put him
on?!?</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Who am I addressing, please?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: That’s Bert Thomas. He produces the
show.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: I’m only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we can’t
allow this to reach the public. When the kidnappers call in, of course
you’re going to be cooperative. Promise them anything they want. After
all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later.
And once we get our hands on him, he’ll tell us where Mr. Langford
is.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Sure. Let him go on if you have to. It’s
just a taping. You can always erase him afterwards, can’t you? All I’m
saying is this: don’t put him on the air.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: That’s fine, Inspector, but let’s say he
finishes his bit and you’ve worked him over …</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Questioned him, Mr. Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Okay, questioned him and he still won’t
talk. We get to eleven thirty and what do we do? Do we air him or
what?</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: I would say no.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: But they might kill Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Okay, Burt. Thank you, Inspector. We
appreciate your position and we’ll do all we can to cooperate with you.
But I have to tell you right now that, if it comes down to it, we’re not
taking any chances with Mr. Langford’s life.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: I understand but …</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: If your men haven’t been able to locate
Mr. Langford by air time, we’re going to have to put this King guy on,
no matter what he’s said. After all, Inspector, what’s ten or fifteen
minutes of talk show time against a man’s life?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Open. Bite … Good.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Can you breathe? Both ways? In and out?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: You’ve got until around midnight. Have a
good time. So long, Jerry! Wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>thomas’ secretary</strong>: Bert Thomas! Who’s calling
please? Yes, Mr. King.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Keep him talking.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yes? … Yes, Mr, King. We understand.
Everything’s been arranged. Now if you’ll just tell me a little about
the nature of your material, so that we can …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’ll tell you everything you need to know at
the studio this evening, Mr. Thomas. I appreciate your co- operation.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I’ve got so much to tell you I just don’t
know what to begin with. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Good. Tell me if you’re not. I guess you’re
wondering why I do stuff like this. I think it’s because I’m a Leo, but
my shrink says I’m pathologically rebellious and self-destructive. You
don’t think I’m self-destructive, do you?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I knew you wouldn’t. That’s ’cause you’re
the only person in the world who really understands me.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Can Randall sub for Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: His agent’s calling us back but it looks
good. I only told him Jerry’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Well, if worse comes to worse, Canter can
always carry it. Let me see your list.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Any one of these a writer?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: McCabe. The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: He’s out.</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: What if we don’t run this King guy?
Who’ll fill the time?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: We’ll stretch the other guests. But I
think we’re going to wind up running him. For one thing, we’ve got to
think about Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>first executive</strong>: And from a news point of view,
we’ve got a responsibility to air this story.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Exactly, Lou. I mean, who would you rather
watch – some tiger expert or a live kidnapper.</p>
<p><strong>a second executive</strong>: But nobody’s going to know he’s
a kidnapper. They’ll think we’ve gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Then they’ll read about it in the papers
tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night, everyone in America will be
watching</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You’re going to put him on twice?</p>
<p><strong>a third executive</strong>: What if his stuff’s unusable?</p>
<p><strong>second executive</strong>: And remember what Patten said
about …</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Hold on. We can always edit the guy. And,
as for a wave of these things, I just don’t buy the idea that there are
that many people out there crazy enough to spend their lives in prison
for a few minutes on television.</p>
<p><strong>mccabe</strong>: Good evening, officer. This is the backstage
door I take it?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Your name please?</p>
<p><strong>mccabe</strong>: Clarence McCabe, the writer. And this is
Mrs. McCabe and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Solters of
Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. I don’t see you here.</p>
<p><strong>mccabe</strong>: I’m on the show tonight, officer.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Well, you’re not here.</p>
<p><strong>mccabe</strong>: Look, Cathy Long gave me instructions to
present myself at a quarter to six. May I see her please?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m under strictest orders tonight to admit
only authorized personnel.</p>
<p><strong>mccabe</strong>: This is absurd. Wait right here.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>mccabe</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Are you the King?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m the King.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Don’t talk to me about tigers!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m the King.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: What can I do for you, your
highness?</p>
<p><strong>cathy long</strong>: What are you doing here,
Mr. Pupkin?!?!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: “I’m gonna love you, Like no one’s ever
loved you, Come rain or come shine, Happy together, unhappy together,
And won’t it be fine.”</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: I hope you brought me the right guy this
time. Where’s Jerry Langford?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Are you on the show?</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: No, Mr. King. That’s my assistant,
Mr. Giardello.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I want to see someone on the show.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Well, you tell us where Mr. Langford is and
we’ll let you see anyone you want.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just get me someone from the show.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Come on, Mr. King. Let’s not fool around.
Should we know about any of these people?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: That’s Orson Bean.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: I see. Check these out.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Now are you going to talk to us, or not?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure I’ll talk. Just get me someone from the
show.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Get that Thomas guy in here.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: We haven’t much time, Mr. King.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Let’s start with your name.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Rupert Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: That’s your real name?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: You an American?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Then why do you people do these things?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Are you on the show?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yes. I’m Bert Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Here’s the introduction to my act. Please
make sure Mr. Randall follows it exactly as I’ve written it.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Okay. How about helping us, Mr. King?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What about make-up? I need make-up.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Put some color in his cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: It was the second lead! I’d never gotten a
part in my life and here I get the second lead. And what does Daddy
say?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Not “Marsha, that’s wonderful” or “we’re
proud of you” or anything. Oh no. He starts lecturing me on how I should
have tried out for Emily! Now do you understand, Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: My doctor says I shouldn’t get excited.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: This is the best I ever made it. You want
some?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Now open. Marsha’s going to feed her
Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: How about it, King?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: If I’m not on that show, Jerry Langford is
dead, I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Hold on two. Hold. Hold. Come on,
Keller. Get it framed!</p>
<p><strong>canter</strong>: Now! Direct from New York! It’s the Jerry
Langford Show with guest host Tony Randall and his special guests –
Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, pundit Gore Vidal, the one and only Zsa Zsa
Gabor and another of Jerry’s taped exclusives, an interview with Prince
Ranier of Monaco. As always, Rick Ross and the Orchestra and me, Bert
Canter. And now … say hello to Tony!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>randall</strong>: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank
you. Thank you very much. I have some sad news for you. Earlier today,
my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing
squad so there’ll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening.</p>
<p><strong>randall</strong>: No embarrassing displays of emotion,
please. Instead, we’re going to do something a little bit different this
evening – a lot different if you ask me. We’re going to give you a
glimpse into the future. It isn’t often that you can call someone a sure
thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in
your hands. But I think tonight, after you’ve met my first guest, you’ll
agree with me that he’s destined for greatness – in one way or another.
So will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest King of
Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!!</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Just hold. Three. Pick up the
audience.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Let me
introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton, New
Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense. Is there anyone
here from Clifton? Good. We can all relax. Now, I’d like to begin by
saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the
fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall
below eleven thousand you’re exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact,
put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to
return me to the hospital as defective. But, like everyone else I grew
up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I’d
say, “Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You’ve been dead for nine
years?” You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful – blonde,
beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic. We used to drink milk together after
school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded. Once she was picked up
for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty – in our garage. When they
tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took
away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke
together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and
she’d</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: That was a wonderful dinner, Marsha. I
want you to know how much I enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: We can do it again.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: I’d like to show you my gratitude. But
it’s a little difficult, like this.</p>
<p><strong>marsha.</strong>: Let’s say I took all this off. What would
you do to me? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: A lot of you are probably wondering why
Jerry couldn’t make it this evening. Well, he’s tied up – and I’m the
one who tied him. You think I’m joking, but that’s the only way I could
break into show business – by hijacking Jerry Langford. I’m not kidding.
Right now, Jerry Langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the
middle of this city. Go ahead. Laugh. But the fact is … I’m here.
Tomorrow you’ll know I wasn’t kidding and you’ll think I was crazy. But
I figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a
Lifetime!!! Good night ladies and gentlemen. God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Who did you get?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Could I have a ride?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: I’ve never been in one.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Okay, Pupkin. We’ll start all over again.
Where is Langford? You know, we’re going to find him sooner or
later.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m trying to tell you, Inspector. You let
me walk out of here, right? And as soon as I’m seen my act on the show –
as soon as I’m sure they’ve really put it on – I’ll tell you where Jerry
is and you’ll get him back safe and sound.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Fine, Pupkin. Then why don’t you watch the
show here with us? That way we’re all happy. What channel?</p>
<p><strong>giardello</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: We get that one in fine. So what do you say,
Pupkin?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Look, I’ll say it again. You let me go
now.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Watch my hair!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I’m sorry, baby.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>a plainclothesman</strong>: Still nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’ve got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: You’re not going anywhere, Pupkin. Now,
where is he?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’m telling you, Inspector, if I don’t see
that show where I want to see it, Jerry Langford is dead. My people have
instructions to execute him unless they hear from me by midnight.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Just where is it you want to watch this
show?</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Ow! God damnit! Not so fast!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: We haven’t all night, baby.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Oh, I love you, baby. I love you so
much.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Here we, are, Pupkin. I don’t know what this
is all about, but as soon as you’ve seen yourself, you’re going to talk
to us or I promise you, you’ll never see daylight again.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I’ll need a couple of minutes,
Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: After it’s over, I want a couple of minutes.
And I’ll need ten dollars. Does anyone of you gentlemen have my
wallet?</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Don’t push me, Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: A condemned man’s last request,
Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you right away, the answer
is no, Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: It’s not much of a ransom, Inspector …</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Look, I’m drawing the line, that’s all! No
ten dollars and that’s it. No – ten – dollars!!!! You understand?!?</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars …</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: … and no Jerry Langford.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, it’s getting late, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>patten</strong>: Go ahead. Give him his goddamned ten
dollars! Give him twenty! I don’t care. Just get him out of here!</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Turn on Langford. Seven.</p>
<p><strong>mousy man</strong>: Hey! I’m watching this.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Just turn it. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mousy man</strong>: I was here first, mister. You can’t just
walk in like this. It isn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Oh, baby. Baby.</p>
<p><strong>langford</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Don’t be afraid of Marsha, baby.</p>
<p><strong>half-stewed man first friend</strong>: Hey, that’s pretty
good.</p>
<p><strong>second friend</strong>: HALF-STEWED WOMAN It’s a trick,
that’s</p>
<p><strong>half-stewed man mousy man</strong>: What about him? Is it
over now?</p>
<p><strong>half-stewed woman first friend</strong>: He’s another one.
He’s funnier than Larry. I told you to shut up about MOUSY MAN my
brother. Well, if nobody She doesn’t know nuthin’. minds …</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Come on, Rita. Don’t spoil the party. Drinks
all around on me.</p>
<p>****: What about the hundred and fifty? We never saw a penny outta
your brother.</p>
<p><strong>half-stewed woman</strong>: That’s because my brother is a
family man, not like Phil.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: What’ll you have?</p>
<p><strong>first friend</strong>: I’m okay. Thanks, pal.</p>
<p><strong>second friend</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I don’t suppose you’re allowed anything. I
guess nobody’s in a celebrating mood. How about you? You want
something?</p>
<p><strong>first plainclothesman</strong>: It’s getting time,
Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: In a second.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That was true, wasn’t it? … about the
kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: Now you can say you knew me. That’s
something, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>first plainclothesman</strong>: Come on, Pupkin.</p>
<p><strong>pupkin</strong>: I guess I’ve got go. Take care of yourself,
will you. And when you’re bored – you know, when you’re brushing your
