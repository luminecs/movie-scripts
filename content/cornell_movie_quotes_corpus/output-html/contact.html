<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You can call it, Nan. Mark time of birth as…
12:04 A.M. Happy New Year, little lady. Tell Ted he has a girl.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: CQ CQ WR2 GFO… WR2 GFO, come back.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: CQ WR2 GFO, do you copy? I’m not getting
anything.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Small moves, Captain, small moves.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I can’t move any smaller.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Try again between the static and ‘Hey Jude’;
that’s where they’re hiding.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Copy… WRS GFO… W2P KLD talking… what’s
your handle, WR2 GFO?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But what do I say?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Just be yourself, Captain. Find out where he
is.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Where are you calling from, W2P KLD, come
back.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Pensacola, over.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Pensacola – ! Where’s Pensacola?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Give you a hint: orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Could we hear to China?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night.
Come on now, under the covers.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Could we hear to the moon?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Big enough radio, I don’t see why not.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Could we hear God?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mmm, that’s a good one. Maybe his echo… Okay,
no more stalling.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Okay, okay… there.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Pensacola.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s a beauty, Captain. Now get some
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Do you think there’re people on other
planets?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well let’s see… the Universe is a pretty big
place… And the one thing I know about nature is it hates to waste
anything. So I guess I’d say if it is just us, an awful lot of space is
going to waste.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Time to sleep now, Captain. But you can ask
more questions in the morning, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>neighbors</strong>: Ellie… Ellie…?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: I’m so sorry, Ellie. More than I can ever
say.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Those lily pads must look like clouds to that
carp, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Ellie… this life doesn’t last forever.
Some day you and your Dad are going to be together again, in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He isn’t in heaven; he’s in the ground. We
just put him there, remember?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: CQ WR2, this is GFO, do you copy? Dad, this
is Ellie, come back.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This is Eleanor Arroway broadcasting on 9.2
megahertz. Dad, are you there? Come back. Come back. Come back…</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: … radio luminosity?</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: I dunno, maybe a post-spectral starburst
or something.</p>
<p><strong>everybody</strong>: Right, right –</p>
<p><strong>voice #3</strong>: E+A is an elliptical? How can you tell
it’s being lensed? Pass me the Fruity Pebbles.</p>
<p><strong>voice #4</strong>: Well I guess you’d have to check other
elliptical galaxies, Mr. Wizard –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I – uh – I was looking for Koestler Hall?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: This is it. Hey, do you know the average
radio-luminosity of an E+A elliptical galaxy?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Um… I’m not sure. Maybe you could deduce it
from lensing a post-spectral starburst…?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: See, I told you! Want some Fruity Pebbles?
Carcinogenic, but totally worth it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … Drumlin said you’re been down at Arecibo
for the last year.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s beautiful but it does get a little
lonely. Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such
godforsaken places isn’t to avoid excess radio traffic but because we’re
all such pathetic antisocial misfits… Speaking of which: How’re you
getting on with the old man?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He’s an incredible prick but I never learned
so much in my life.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s what they all say.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Ellie. Arroway.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Peter Valerian.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sounds like a Russian general.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yavol.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: You’re out of shape, Valerian. What’s the
matter, eat too many tacos down there in Puerto Rico?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I read your paper on ETI’s. It’s
brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Keep it down, okay? Drumlin thinks I’m enough
of a flake as it is. Look – everyone here has their little fetishes.
Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon’s got his carnivorous plants… mine
just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What a coincidence. It happens to be my
fetish too.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: You two coming along or you just gonna do
it right here in the sand?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … I’m just so sick of feeling defensive about
the things I care about! Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by
people like Drumlin, when if they’d just put aside their preconceptions
for two seconds and look at the facts…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They can’t. I think it’s against human nature
to admit to that level of… insignificance; to not see yourself as
basically the center of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s like the pre-Copernicans who swore the
sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last
century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I
mean… try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us – then
imagine trying to explain… I dunno, a microwave oven – to someone even a
hundred years ago – I mean the basic concepts didn’t exist…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: ‘Any sufficiently advanced technology…’</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: ‘… is indistinguishable from magic.’</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I dunno. I know I should be objective,
ice-cold hard-assed scientific about it, but just on an intuitive level
– what’s the point of a universe so vast if we’re the only ones it it?
It’d just be such a… waste of space.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – but I’ve already submitted my proposal!</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: I’m sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too
Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your
career it’d be tantamount to suicide.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m willing to take that risk.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: I’m not. You’re far too promising a
scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could
potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.
There are over four hundred billion stars out there –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: And only two probabilities: One: there is
intelligent life in the universe but they’re so far away you’ll never
contact it in your lifetime –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Two: There’s nothing out there but noble
gasses and carbon compounds and you’d be wasting your time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What if you’re wrong? No – I’ll grant you
probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence – you can’t
deny the possibility – and I believe even the remotest possibility of
something this profoundly… profound is worth investigation – and worth
taking a few risks.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: I disagree.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Then disagree but don’t stand in my way!</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: What is it that makes you so lonely, Miss
Arroway? What is it that compels you to search the heavens for life when
there’s so much of it being neglected right here at home?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: I will approve a general thesis on the
detection of radio signals from space but that’s all. No E.T.I.s.
Enough?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … I keep telling myself okay, that’s just the
price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you’re allowed to
get to the good stuff… but if I have to catalog one more quasar… God,
I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Any luck on the grant money?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Please. Any chance of that died the day David
Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F. I have been in contact with a
few other SETI people; we’ve been trying to find backing from private
investors. I’ve even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope
time here and there…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’ve examined over forty stars of roughly
solar spectral type but so far nothing. Still, we’ve barely started…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … We’ve been going after some of the big
multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York
dowager… We’ve even been thinking about selling T-shirts.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ellie… even if you do manage to raise the
money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow
through on this? I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we’re talking
about your career. You won’t be publishing. You won’t be taken
seriously… and you could spend your entire life looking and never find
anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If we lived at any previous time in human
history we wouldn’t even have the option of failing – we’d have to
wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it. This time, right
now, is unique in our history, in any civilization’s history – the
moment of the acquisition of technology. The moment when contact becomes
possible. We’ve already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to
be alive now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How close are you to getting this funding put
together?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s almost there. The hardest part is
getting someone to sell us the telescope time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree
to sell you time in New Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The V.L.A.?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thirty-one linked dishes. You could search
more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter – if you can get him to do that for me
he’d obviously do the same for you – we could – !</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Actually –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: We could be together again –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: – I’m moving to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Greenbank?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for
Drumlin.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But what about your research – ?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is a chance to be of enormous help to
other people’s research – to have the power to be a real advocate where
David’s got blind spots –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But the work –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: ‘The work,’ Jesus, Ellie, can’t there just
once be more to life than the work? Okay, maybe that’s the only way to
get the recognition, win the prizes –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Please, you’re just as ambitious as I am,
more –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe that’s the problem. I want… a family,
Ellie. I want kids. A townhouse on L street instead of still living like
a college kid. A real life. Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don’t
care anymore. It’s what I want.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And you think I don’t want those things? You
think I don’t stay up half the night wondering if I’ve made the right
choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is
worth what I’m giving up for it everyday? Let’s get married.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jesus –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Right now – we’ll drive down to Ramey and get
the base chaplain to marry us.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ellie –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m serious about this, Peter –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ellie – I’m getting married. Her name’s
Laura. She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months
after you left.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That is true. But it’s also true that if I
really thought we wanted the same things, I’d follow you anywhere… but
the truth is I don’t think you want the company. Be honest, El. There’s
nowhere you’d rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the
world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe. And
call me crazy, but I just can’t compete with that… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Light’s behind you, to the left.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Dr. Cullers?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be
Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Ellie. Pulsar?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: 1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing;
probably a starquake.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Nice. Where?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Here, right around Centaurus A.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This is how you see the sky?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: It’s how I hear it. The display’s just a
little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of
sight.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear
it’s nice too.</p>
<p><strong>millington</strong>: Yo, Ray Charles, time’s up. Oh – sorry
–</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Doctors Millington, Curtain, Dr. Arroway.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Rick’s doing black holes at the center of
galaxies; Tom’s studying globular clusters in the e-band. And
Dr. Arroway here will be spending her precious time listening for little
green men. All yours, guys.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Um… should I…</p>
<p><strong>millington/curtain</strong>: No, no, no – have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hey, Fish, has that pointing error in
twenty-nine been fixed yet?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: It’s a worm gear; still a little sluggish
but it’ll have to do.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: J39 Z186…?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: VB10’s an M dwarf; Signa Draconis… too
old.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: You’ve only searched – what is it, sixteen
hundred stars without a peep? Try not to take it too personally.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Sensitive. I’m coming at this
wrong… missing something… something…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Now I remember why I went into theoretical
work. Kent.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Glad to have you, David. How’s the new
office?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Still settling in, really. Where’s
Dr. Arroway?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: … not that there’s a whole lot in the way of
entertainment around here but I guess it beats communing with washing
machines.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Nothing. Okay. Some of us have been a little…
not concerned, exactly, but…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish – Dr. Fisher –
was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: So… there wasn’t any clothes in the machine.
She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against
the Maytag. Listening.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Pepsi? Tequila?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Peter sends his regards.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh? How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Very well; since my appointment he’s been
made interim director.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Really? Congratulations, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: I’m surprised you even knew it was an
election year.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: ‘President’s Science Advisor’ – so what, you
just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now…?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Now exactly. It’s… complicated.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No doubt.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ellie…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Did I tell you we’ve expanded the search
spectrum? We’re including several other possible magic frequencies – not
just the hydrogen line anymore. I was trying to get inside their heads,
y’know? And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the
Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious –
transcendantals, right? So we’ve been trying variations of pi…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: You know why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s not enough having my search time
systematically cut down – you know I’m down to three hours a week
now.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ellie, I should have done this a long time
ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every
benefit of the doubt –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You can’t just pull the plug, David.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: It’s not like you’ve given me much
choice.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Meaning…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the
President and to Congress and you’re out here listening to washing
machines.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m searching for patterns in the noise,
that’s all. Order in the chaos. I’m practicing listening –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: The point is, this isn’t just scientific
inquiry anymore – it’s turned into some kind of personal obsession.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The difference being what – that I refuse to
adopt the standard line, that I don’t care about the results of my work?
Well, I do care. Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course
it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to
go around pretending I’m some kind of dispassionate automaton when it’s
obvious to anyone with a brain I’m just not.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: No… You’re not. But the price has just
gotten too high.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Goddamnit, they are out there, David –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Then why haven’t you detected any signals?
If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced
civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn’t one signal
gotten through? It’ll take a month or two for the paperwork to go
through; you’re welcome to stay until then.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: David –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: It was a worthy experiment – worthy of you;
I was wrong about that part. But it’s over now.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: My guest tonight is author and
theologian Palmer Joss, ‘God’s diplomat’ according to the New York
Times. His new book – Losing Faith – is currently number one on that
publication’s bestseller list. Thanks for being with us, Reverend. Okay
– who’s losing faith – and why?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Well, let me start this way, Larry. What has
science done for you lately?</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: Besides letting me broadcast this
program all over the world?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Besides that. Or better, I’ll give you that,
but tell me this: Are you happier? Are we happier? Is our would
fundamentally a better place?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Don’t get me wrong – we’re smart, Larry. We
shop at home, we surf the net… and we feel emptier and lonelier and more
cut off from each other than at any other time in human history…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Y’know who’d make great astronomers?
Vampires. Think about it; the perfect synthesis of career and
lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Shut up, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Got a bogey, boss?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m not sure. You mind checking right
ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41
minutes?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: What’s the frequency?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: 4458.8 gigahertz.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s probably nothing.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hydrogen times pi… Got it. Strong
sucker.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Put it on speakers.</p>
<p><strong>willie fisher</strong>: Could be AWACS from Glitch in number
Kirtland; verifying seventeen. intensity. Wasn’t Monochromatic, strong
seventeen where we found too. That was twenty- that owl’s nest last
three, besides I got month? signal across the board.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Checking interferometric position. Somewhere
in Lyra, I think…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Vega…?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: That can’t be right; it’s only twenty-six
light years away.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results,
always.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Linearly polarized; a set of moving pulses
restricted to two different amplitudes –</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Air Force isn’t supposed to be on this
frequency.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s what they always say; punch up the
darks.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How’s the spying tonight, guys?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: NORAD’s not tracking any spacecraft in our
vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor’s in sleep mode.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Interferometry now rules out a Molniya-type
orbit.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Confirming sidereal motion; whatever it is,
it ain’t local.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Display absolute intensity.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Reading over a hundred janskys –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Numbers. Those are numbers, each pulse is a
set – break it down –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: 79 – 83 – 91 – they’re all primes, no way
that’s a natural phenomenon – !</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Okay, let’s just slow down. Pull up the
starfield signal origin.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: It can’t be coming from Vega, the system’s too
young.</p>
<p><strong>ellie willie</strong>: Maybe they didn’t grow up
Constellation Lyra, there, maybe they’re just brightest star Vega,
visiting. A-zero main sequence dwarf, estimate several KENT million
years old. The system’s full of debris Distance 26 light years – any
spacecraft that accretion disk, no stayed for long would get known
planets. clobbered.</p>
<p><strong>nearby skeptic</strong>: Not if they took evasive action and
used their photon torpedoes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Or if they’re in polar orbit – but no, you’re
right. If we go public and we’re wrong, that’s it – it is over for us.
Vega will set in a couple of hours; it’s probably already risen in
Australia. Let’s call Ian and see if we can get some verification on
this.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Okay. We have an intense, not very
monochromatic signal, linearly polarized as if coming from an antenna,
source moving with the stars so it can’t be an airplane or spacecraft;
on and only on a frequency whose only significance would be to an
intelligence that wanted to be directed. If anyone can come up with any
plausible or even implausible explanation besides ETI I want to hear it,
now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah – yeah, just a sec –</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: … We put it smack in the middle –</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: Vega.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thanks, Ian. Can you just keep tracking it as
long as you can and we’ll get back to you. Get this out to every
observatory and radio array on the planet. Um… and get me the
President’s Science Advisor.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hello, Pensacola…</p>
<p><strong>anomalous intermittent radio source at right</strong>:
ASCENSION 18 34m, DECLINATION PLUS 38 DEGREES 41 MINUTES, DISCOVERED BY
VLA SYSTEMATIC SKY SURVEY. FREQUENCY 4458.8 GIGAHERTZ, LYRA/VEGA SYSTEM.
174 AND 179 JANSKYS. EVIDENCE AMPLITUDES ENCODE SEQUENCE OF PRIME
NUMBERS. FULL LONGITUDE COVERAGE URGENTLY NEEDED. E. ARROWAY, DIRECTOR,
PROJECT ARGUS, SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO, U.S.A.</p>
<p><strong>protesters</strong>: U-F-O-s – We want to know –</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: The President will be making a statement in
due time; until then we have no comment.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: What’s the latest?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Forty-four stations worldwide now confirming
the signal, sir.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Let’s get some decryption people here, now.
Dr. Lunacharsky’s visiting at the University of New Mexico –</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: I don’t get it. If this civilization is so
advanced why the remedial math?</p>
<p><strong>senate delegate</strong>: Why don’t they just speak
English?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Maybe because seventy percent of the planet
speaks other languages.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Mathematics is the only truly universal
language, Senator. We think this may be a beacon – an announcement to
get our attention.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: If it’s attention you want I’d say you’ve
got it. Just one thing: Why Vega? Everyone’s looked at Vega for years
with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s hardly yesterday; the signal’s been
traveling for over twenty-six years. As for why… I’m hoping your own
expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out – to see if
there’s another message buried deeper in the signal.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Dr. Arroway –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Michael Kitz, National Security
Advisor.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Dr. Arroway, let me first say –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Before you do could you please ask the
gentlemen with the firearms to wait outside? This is a civilian
facility.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, and if you could ask them not to use
their radios – interference. Thanks so much.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: I’ll come right to the point, Doctor. Your
sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National
Security.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This isn’t a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.
I don’t really think the civilization sending the message intended it
just for Americans.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: I’m saying you might have consulted us; the
contents of this message could be extremely sensitive…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You want to classify prime numbers?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Mike, because of the Earth’s rotation we’re
only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the
whole message is to cooperate with other stations. If Dr. Arroway hadn’t
moved quickly we could have lost key elements.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Okay, fine, they’ve got the primes – but if
you’re right about there being another more significant transmission
still to come –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – which we’ll also need the network’s help to
receive and decode!</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: You don’t seem to understand that it’s your
interests I’m trying to protect – !</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Interference – we’re losing the signal.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Can’t we get rid of them?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s a civilian facility.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Colonel Jarrod, I’d like a twenty mile
radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And a hundred mile airspace.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: And a hundred mile airspace.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: … under control for the moment but the longer
we wait the more unstable the situation could become. I think you should
consider coming here…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … could it be a nested code of some sort?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: You must have checked the signal for
polarization modulation already…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Dr. Lunacharsky…?</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: Analyzing signal polarization
shifts.</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: A second layer, nested within the main
signal; possibly… a picture? Product of three primes…</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: … definitely three dimensions, either a
hologram or a two- dimensional picture that moves in time; a movie.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Hope there’s a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: How is that possible? How could all that
information be encoded in –</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Well, sir, some bits of the signal are bits
that tell us how to interpret the other bits. Technically speaking.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Enlarge.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Try plotting values in a three dimensional
coordinate system.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Throw a gray scale on it; standard
interpolation.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It has to be an image. Stack it up,
string-breaks every 60th character.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Um… I’ve got an auxiliary sideband channel
here. I think it’s audio.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: What in the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: It’s a hoax. I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Um, excuse me, but would someone mind telling
me what the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Anybody know German?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: The Fuhrer… welcomes the world to the German
Fatherland… for the opening of the 1936 Olympic Games.</p>
<p><strong>german announcer</strong>: … the signal from the American
observatory depicting Adolph Hitler has brought about chaos in the
streets of Berlin, where hundreds of neo-Nazis gathered to swear eternal
fealty…</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Forty million people die defeating
that sonofabitch and he becomes our first ambassador to another
civilization? It makes me sick.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: With all due respect, the Hitler broadcast
from the ‘36 Olympics was the first television transmission of any power
that went into space. That they recorded it and sent it back is simply a
way of saying ’Hello, we heard you –’</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: – Or ‘you’re our kind of people –’</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: – It’s extremely unlikely that they had any
idea what they were looking at.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: I can’t believe that everything on TV
is automatically broadcast all over the universe. ‘Hard Copy’… Rickie
Lake’… Oh God, the ‘60 Minutes’ interview.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: My fellow Americans, citizens of
the world, ladies and gentlemen of the press. At 7:09 A.M. Eastern
Standard Time yesterday morning, American scientists detected a radio
signal from space. This message was largely mathematical, and in spite
of some of the headlines I’ve seen today, so far seems to be completely
benign in nature. To better explain the extraordinary events of the last
24 hours, I’m turning you over to… Doctor David Drumlin.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Good morning. In 1936 a very faint
television signal transmitted the opening ceremonies of the Olympic
games as a show of German superior technology. That signal left Earth at
the speed of light and twenty-six years later arrived on Vega, which
they then sent back to us hugely amplified. As evidence of intelligence
this is indisputable –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Whoever or whatever they are, they’re
clearly move advanced than we…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: … maybe only decades or centuries, maybe
much further along than that…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What…</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: In ancient times when parchment was in
short supply people would write over old writing… it was called a
palimpsest.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: A third layer.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: It’s incredibly rich. We’ve been cataloging it
in frames or ‘pages’; right now we’re on 10,413.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It could be anything. The first volume of
some Encyclopedia Galactica…</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: … instructions to acquaint us with their
colonization procedures.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Moses with a few billion new commandments…</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Ms. President, in the interest of national
security, I strongly recommend we militarize this project immediately
–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Pardon me, but you can’t do – !</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: If at some later date the message proves
harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but
until then –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s terrific, but there’s one problem: we
don’t have the means to receive all the data on our own.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: The only way would be if we had a radio
telescope in orbit.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: We don’t? Why don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Because you cut it from the budget three
years running.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: How soon will you be able to
decode it?</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: There’s no way of knowing. Without a
key – a primer, to help us, maybe never.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Maybe it’ll be at the end of the data when
the message recycles.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Well. That would seem to decide
it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we’re all in
this together.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: That’s it, Mike. Last time I
checked, I was still running the country. Although it seems that for the
moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>wolf blitzer</strong>: … There had been speculation on the
part of psychologists that the proliferation of depictions of aliens in
movies and on television in recent years might make for an almost blase
acceptance of the news.</p>
<p><strong>wolf blitzer</strong>: But the truth is, it turns out, is far
stranger than anything Hollywood might have dreamed up – and here,
today, the prospect of extraterrestrial intelligence if no longer
science fiction – it’s the best show in town.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … I know you’re angry – we’re all angry.
About the lies. The corruption. About the cancer of despair spreading
through every aspect of our lives. But Rome will fall, my friends;
everywhere now are the signs of closure. Even now the end begins.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: The millennium is upon us. God has fulfilled
his promise, sending us this herald to warn the faithless – the
scientists who tell us He doesn’t even exist – and to promise us, the
faithful, we will be saved.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: I don’t know what this voice from the sky
says – but I do know that if history has taught us anything, it’s that
the politicians and the scientists are lying to us, right now, for their
own good! Are these the kind of people you want talking to your God for
you – ?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: … Arrangements also have to be made for the
V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: The theological ramifications of all this
are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests
rather than alienate them. She’s also named Palmer Joss as their
liaison; he’s requested a meeting with you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: With me.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Apparently he’s genuinely interested in
science. This could be a chance to win him over.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m going to convert Mr. Science-is-
the-root-of-all-evil? This is absurd, David. We have work to do here, I
don’t have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ellie –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: I want you to listen to me, carefully. The
minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being
simply a scientific matter and became a political one – an extremely
complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don’t
understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Are you threatening me?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: It’s not a threat, Ellie, it’s a fact – if
you’re not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.
Play ball. Really. It’s good advice.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: We’ve repeated. A few minutes ago the
message cycled back to page one.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: No primer.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How can that be?</p>
<p><strong>lunacharsky</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe there is a fourth
layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can’t find
it.</p>
<p><strong>bernie shaw</strong>: … And with church attendance at record
highs, a coalition of religious leaders are using their increased
political capital to challenge the very legality of radio astronomy
itself, claiming the message and its contents subvert the moral climate
of their constituencies. More after this…</p>
<p><strong>commercial announcer</strong>: In the air, under the sea, in
the depths of D.N.A. itself, Hadden Industries is at the frontier…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Someone’s broken into the system, someone’s
compromised the fucking – !</p>
<p><strong>major domo</strong>: You should be flattered. He hardly lands
for anyone.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Dr. Arroway, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: S.R. Hadden… You compromised our security
codes.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Once upon a time I was a hell of an
engineer. Please, sit, Doctor. I have guests so rarely, it’s important
to me they feel welcome in my home. Did you know this was once Yeltsin’s
flying dascha? That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the
pilot. At least that’s what the people who sold me the plane said…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You live here.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: I find it convenient to keep my interests…
mobile. Anyway, I’ve had my fill of life on the ground. After spending
much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to
offer – after outliving three wives and two children… I find I’ve had
quite enough of planet Earth.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.
You’re here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What kind of deal?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: The powers that be have been quite busy
lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of
the century, if not the millennium. Perhaps you’ve noticed. Perhaps I
could help deal you back in.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I didn’t realize I was out.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Oh, maybe not out – but definitely looking
for you coat. I understand you’ve had some difficulty locating the –
what are you calling it? The ‘primer’ that will make decryption
possible… I’ve found it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’ve… found it. What could I possibly have
that you would want, Mr. Hadden?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: I’ve had a long time to make enemies,
Dr. Arroway. There are many governments, business interests, even
religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant
them their wish soon enough… But before I do, I wish to make a small
contribution – a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this
little planet who’ve given – from whom I’ve taken so much.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If I knew you any better I’d say that doesn’t
sound like you.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: That’s my girl… Lights.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Forgive the theatrics, it’s a weakness.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Page after page of data – over sixty-three
thousand in all, if I’m not mistaken… and at the end of each…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: A page-break signal. A period.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Not if you think like a Vegan.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re saying… there is no separate primer in
the message – because it’s on every page so the recipient can decipher
it wherever he is –</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: – even if he doesn’t receive the entire
transmission. Heaven is the mustard seed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: You’ll like this part. A little flashy…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Some kind of circuitry…?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Very good, Doctor. I’ve also detected
structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple
to the complex – all of which would seem to indicate instructions – an
enormously complicated set of instructions – for building something.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: A machine. But a machine that does what?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: That would seem to be the question of the
hour. I want to build it, Doctor. Of course I’m already lobbying through
the usual channels of influence and corruption – but as I said, my
colorful past has made many of those channels… difficult to navigate. I
need someone on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And in return?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: In return… you get the primer – and with it
the power to stay in the game. Do we have a deal?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Mr. Hadden, I’m a scientist; I don’t make
deals… But. If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your
information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts
to promote your cause wherever it doesn’t conflict with the best
interests of science… or my better judgment.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: That’s my girl. Done.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … And while its function remains, for the
moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of
some kind.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: A transport. So are they coming or
are we going?</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: The transport theory is only one hypothesis,
Ms. President, and in my view a rather naive one. It could just as
easily be some kind of Trojan Horse. We build it and out pours the
entire Vegan army.</p>
<p><strong>chairman of joint chiefs</strong>: Why even bother to risk
personnel? Why not send some kind of doomsday machine? Every time an
emerging technological civilization announces itself by broadcasting
radio waves into space they reply with a message. The civilization
builds it and blows itself up. No expeditionary force needed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Ms. President, this is communist paranoia
right out of War of the Worlds. There is no reason whatsoever to believe
the ETIs intentions are hostile. We pose no threat to them – it would be
like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Interesting analogy. And how guilty would
we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in
Africa?</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: I hope you’re right, Doctor. But right now my
job is to protect American lives from any plausible threat, and in that
regard I have to assume the worst.</p>
<p><strong>richard rank</strong>: From a non-secular perspective, I’m
forced to agree.</p>
<p><strong>rank</strong>: My coalition’s phone lines have been flooded
with calls from concerned families, wondering if this message signifies
the end of the world or the advent of the rapture. We feel that U.S.
policy in this matter wants to be extremely conservative – if there’s
any chance of danger or threat to our way of life perhaps the message
and its contents should simply be disregarded.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This is absurd.</p>
<p><strong>rank</strong>: The Bible states that God made man in His own
image. From everything I’ve been told it’s highly unlikely the creatures
who sent this message resemble human beings in any way, shape or form,
ergo, they are not of God; and therefore by definition evil. My
constituents simply want to know what their government plans to do to
protect them –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Ms. President, forgive me but I thought this
was to be a serious discussion of policy and technical issues, not a war
council against Satan’s minions –</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Mr. Rank’s organization represents
the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel
free to disagree, but there won’t be any suppressing of opinions here
today.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes – of course – all I’m saying is, this
message was written in the language of science – mathematics – and was
clearly intended to be received by scientists. If it had been religious
in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming
voice from the sky…</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: But a voice from the sky is just what you say
you’ve found.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I agree with Mr. Rank that there are
unavoidable religious implications here – but I don’t think it justifies
taking an alarmist position. Dr. Arroway is right – their chosen means
of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is
probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the
problem become more apparent.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And where exactly does that put your
position…?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I’d have to say I don’t know enough to have
one yet. For the moment I don’t believe the two approaches have to be
mutually exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: What’s the status of the
decryption effort?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: We’re continuing around the clock, but the
amount of data is enormous. It’s difficult to tell when we’ll find the
key that will tell us the machine’s purpose – maybe tomorrow, maybe next
year, maybe never.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: I want to know the minute you find
anything.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Of course, Ms. President. We’ll keep you
fully informed.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: The President wants to discuss a few
matters in private.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My wife Laura…</p>
<p><strong>ellie/laura</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You look wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You dress up pretty good yourself. How’s… the
baby?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Wonderful. She’s almost four now.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Really. Well. That’s wonderful… Well. If
you’ll excuse me – I’m paid to mingle… I don’t believe I just said
that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s good to see you, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Champagne please.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Make that two.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Want to fight some more?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: … What I’m curious about are the wilderness
years. You’re out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics. It
must have taken tremendous faith.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’d say logic more than faith. The odds were
on my side.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: And what would you have done if the odds had
gone against you?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I guess I would’ve felt sorry for the
universe.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Spoken like a true believer.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What about you? Doesn’t all of this shake
your faith at all?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well it’s been a while, but I don’t recall
the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: ‘My father’s house has many mansions.’</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Very smooth. It’s Palmer, right? Where I came
from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards. Really though… the
Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand
years old. I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions
of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars… I mean burn me for
a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Who was it who said – it was a scientist I
think – that one’s sophistication is determined by the ability to
tolerate paradox – to hold contradictory ideas at the same time…</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: … which I suppose is as good a definition of
faith as any. Care to test yours?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: It’s okay. I’m a preacher.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Your ‘faith’ tells you that the distance a
pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only
smaller.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s not faith, it’s physics. The second
law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: And you believe this law with all your heart
and soul.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And mind, yes. What are you –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings
back you wouldn’t flinch.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Don’t lean forward. Not even a hair.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I flinched.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer
is allowed a little doubt.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s not doubt. That’s four hundred years
of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what
you religious types did with your free time.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Now you know.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: … It’s an old story. I grew up in South
Boston, more or less on the streets. By the time I was thirteen I’d
tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I’d stopped using but I was
dealing full-time. By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn’t want to
live any more, at least not in a world like that. One day I got on a
bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just
kept walking. Didn’t eat, didn’t sleep… just walked. I ended up
collapsing in a wheat field. There was a storm… I woke up… And that’s
about as far as words’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Can you try?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I had… an experience. Of belonging. Of
unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn’t
terrified, and I wasn’t alone.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And there’s no chance you had this experience
simply because some part of you needed to have it?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Look, I’m a reasonable person, and reasonably
intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I
had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is,
is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small
and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You may not believe this… but there’s a part
of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe
that we’re all here for a purpose, that all this… means something. But
it’s because that part of me wants it so badly that I’m so stubborn
about making sure it isn’t just self-delusion. Of course I want to know
God if there is one… but it has to be real. Unless I have proof how can
I be sure?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Do you love your parents?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I never knew my mother. My father died when I
was nine.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Did you love him?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What is it? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: We’ve cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You mean –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: You were right, Ellie. You were right all
along.</p>
<p><strong>secretary general</strong>: A human has been summoned.</p>
<p><strong>secretary general</strong>: Who will that person be? How will
this ambassador be chosen?</p>
<p><strong>indian delegate</strong>: … of course none of us would be
here if it weren’t for the scientist who first discovered the history-
making message and who has led this effort from the very beginning –
Dr. Eleanor Arroway –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Um… thanks… Thanks very much. I’m not sure
what I did to earn that response; I just happened to pick up the phone
when they called.</p>
<p><strong>bbc reporter</strong>: … and as the curtain falls on the
first day of the symposium the question remains: who will build this
machine, if it indeed will be built – and if it is, who will be selected
as the Earth’s first ambassador to another world. This is Marjorie
Blake, B.B.C.3, at the U.N.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: David –</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Do you have a minute – ?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Actually I’m running late –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’ll just take a moment.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: David… I know we’ve had our differences… but
I’ve always thought of you as a fair man, even when we’ve disagreed –
and It’s in that light I’m hoping you’ll consider my request…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m asking for your help, David. I want to
go. They’ll need someone relatively young, unattached – and probably a
scientist. As the President’s Science Advisor you have enormous weight…
I’m asking if you’ll support my candidacy.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ellie… you should know that I’m no longer
the President’s Science Advisor.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: As of three o’clock this afternoon. I
submitted my resignation.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Excuse me, I’m late for a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: … And as our parents did a
generation before us…</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: … I believe we should dedicate
ourselves, by the end of this decade – to build this machine that our
brothers from across the vastness of time and space have asked us to
build – !</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: To meet with courage and
determination the challenges of this new day – !</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: To greet with hope the dawn of
this new Century!</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: And to raise our voices to the
heavens as one world, one people, in one ringing, defiant declaration –
bring on the millennium!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I’m here with Peter Valerian, recently
named David Drumlin’s replacement as Science Advisor to the President.
Doctor, there were loud complaints from the international community last
week when it was announced that three of the ten candidates – were to be
Americans. How do you defend that decision?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I believe the response was somewhat
disingenuous; when it was determined that national interests would be
represented on a pay for play basis it was understood that the U.S., by
shouldering close to one third of the financial burden, would be
entitled to commensurate representation.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You’ve addressed the political side of the
coin but what about the larger issues? On what basis do you choose a
human being to represent humanity?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s a good question. Who do you send? An
athlete? A religious leader? A philosopher? A soldier? If you don’t know
what the Olympic event will be, you send a decathlon champion –</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: And if the event turns out to be
chess?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes… well, ultimately it was decided that the
representative should be somebody fluent in the language the message was
sent in – science. If you’ll excuse me –</p>
<p><strong>cnn reporter</strong>: … and if you look closely you can just
see the superstructure beginning to take shape. Construction on this
trillion dollar plus effort has been complicated by the nearly
unprecedented scale…</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: You realize how absurd this is. There
are no precedents here; all training models are useless. Trying to turn
us all into astronauts is a pathetic waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: You know what, sir? You’re right. We have
no idea whatsoever what one of you may encounter. That leaves us with
two options: we can sit around and do nothing and hope for the best,
even if that includes a few things that feel a little silly. And if one
of these ‘silly’ exercises ends up saving your life I’ll have done my
job.</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: How long now?</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Going on five hours.</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: Ugly little suckers.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Yeah. And those are only the ones that
live on the human body.</p>
<p><strong>nigerian candidate</strong>: … but even if somehow it has
faster than light capacity it is still twenty-six years to get to Vega
–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s from the point of view of someone on
Earth – from the traveler’s point of view it’ll only seem like two
years…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: … the fact is, nobody here knows what’s
gonna happen when one of us enters that thing. We can guess all we want,
but in the end… we just don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: … Two years is still a hell of a long time
– and as far as we can tell there aren’t any provisions in the machine
design for storing food, water, even air…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … I can’t believe they wouldn’t take
something as basic as our biological needs into account…</p>
<p><strong>russian candidate</strong>: Based on what evidence? As far as
we know all they know about us is what they’ve learned from watching
three minutes of German television… even if they do not mean to do
damage they may do so inadvertently. Look at the impact they’ve had on
the world by simply sending the message…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … we’re not looking at this from their point
of view. It’s the first time this has happened to us but it’s highly
unlikely that’s true for them as well. Chances are they’ve been doing
this for thousands if not millions of years…</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: They knew our level of development. If, as
you say, they’ve done this many times they’d be well aware of the
implications.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Maybe they are. Maybe this is all part of the
package. The building of the machine has demanded international
cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Maybe requiring us to come
together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: Very well. Assume this is true. Assume
they have only the best of intentions. Suppose they decide to just step
in and solve all our problems for us. You have no objection to them so
flagrantly intervening in human affairs?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: We’ve just lived through a century of
incredible violence and self- destruction. Do you call it
‘interventionist’ when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a
truck?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Sorry to bother you but they just got
some tape in from Japan – I think you’re gonna want to see this.</p>
<p><strong>female p.a. voice</strong>: Component test C-4-90 commencing
in T-minus three minutes. All personnel clear bay twelve; repeat, clear
bay twelve –</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: This just came in from systems
integrations in Hokkaido.</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: The chamber contains an exotic
substance manufactured according to message specifications. In its
normal state it appears as you see it, a transparent gas which is
apparently breathable. As you’ll see, it also has some other… unusual
properties.</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: The substance appears to have
intelligent multiphasic properties; able to shift states at will. We
believe it may function as some sort of transport medium.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Now I know why the Japanese gave up having
a candidate in exchange for licensing rights…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: We have no idea. According to all known
physical laws it shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Magic…</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: What you haven’t seen is what occurred
when a technician went into the chamber to retrieve the bullet… As I
said, the substance had already been deemed breathable after extensive
tests on laboratory animals.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: There was apparently an aqueous residue
covering part of the chamber floor. The technician slips. As he falls
the substance hardens around him, breaking his fall…</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: … and solidifying in his lungs and
bloodstream, killing him instantly.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Maybe… maybe it was an anomalous reaction.
Maybe when it’s correctly integrated with other components of the
machine…</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: Maybe. Unfortunately that’s all we have
is maybes, increasing exponentially every day. This machine is now
building itself as much as we’re building it. Almost as if it’s growing,
evolving…</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: It’s scary, folks. We’re like cavemen
building a nuclear warhead. We are constructing the most advanced,
dangerously powerful… whateveritis in the history of the planet and we
don’t have a fucking clue how we’re doing it.</p>
<p><strong>project leader</strong>: Personal recording unit.</p>
<p><strong>project leader</strong>: Normal, infrared, ultraviolet,
stereoscopic lenses, digital microchip good for thousands of hours of
recording, state of the art, very tough, casting good to 15,000 degrees
plus or minus.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: 15,000 degrees… isn’t that a little
excessive?</p>
<p><strong>project leader</strong>: Well, sir… the thinking was…</p>
<p><strong>project leader</strong>: The thinking was that even if the
passenger were to encounter conditions that were… extreme… there still
might be a chance to retrieve the helmet.</p>
<p><strong>project leader</strong>: Lightweight, easily concealable…</p>
<p><strong>project leader</strong>: … and good for approximately one
thousand uses.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Does it dice and make julienne fries?</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: You have a question,
Dr. Arroway?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I question the thinking behind sending the
first ambassador to another civilization in armed – basically announcing
our intentions are hostile.</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: It’s designed purely as a
defensive device. Call it a reasonable precaution.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Call it xenophobic paranoia. Don’t you see
the absolute absurdity of this? This isn’t about them, it’s about us –
our violence, our fear and mistrust –</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to
your opinion. But we feel quite strongly that it would by both
irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown,
completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Y’know what? Fine. I guess if we want them to
know the truth about who we are there’s no quicker way to show them.</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: Good morning, Dr. Arroway.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: We’ve been giving them to the astronauts
since the first days of the Mercury program; of course it’s never been
made public. It’s fast and painless. As soon as it hits the oral mucosa
it starts to work – a matter of seconds, really.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You want me to travel all the way to Vega to
commit suicide?</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: Doctor, despite your enduring faith that
the civilization in question has only our best interests at heart, even
you have to admit there’s a possibility they might turn out to be… less
than benign.</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: And even if they aren’t, something else
may go wrong. There may be an unforeseen mechanical failure. You may be
marooned, unable to return. There are a thousand reasons we can think of
for the occupant of the machine to have this with them – but mostly it’s
for the reasons we can’t think of.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Say it again? What did you tell your
daddy?</p>
<p><strong>russell’s little girl</strong>: I don’t want you to go.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Nothing would give me more pride than to
represent my country and my world. But what do you say to that?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: You like to drive fast.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the
enemy like this?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Some of my best friends are scientists.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I was referring to the selectees mingling
with the selectors.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Some of my best friends are scientists.
They’re saying the machine is alive.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Not exactly. It has organic qualities, but we
don’t really understand how they’re integrated with the mechanical
systems.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Maybe you’re creating a monster.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s too… elegant. The degree of economy is
extraordinary; it’s really the next logical step… Even on Earth
technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A.
outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most
exquisitely designed machine imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: In other words, God is one hell of an
engineer.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: In other words.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Relativity. Explain this to me one more time…
even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If you came back.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: If you came back… you’d only be four years
older – but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: And everybody you care about would be dead and
buried.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If you came back. If you survived at all.
Which it’s pretty certain you wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: You’re willing to die for this.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s what my whole life’s been… aimed at; the
only thing that’s given it a sense of purpose.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I read your book.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the
Age of Reason. Catchy.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What’d you think?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m more interested in the story behind the
story… How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston
to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the
President.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I won’t deny I was ambitious. When I had my…
experience… I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible. I’m
the first to admit that process included making some compromises. You
didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.
And a little bit naive… But that’s just the enemy’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I don’t consider you the enemy, Ellie. I’m not
‘out to get’ technology. I only ask the question: Does it have to have
all the answers? I look out there and I see so much emptiness… People
are so starved for meaning, and it’s something they just don’t seem to
be getting from science.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Did you ever stop to think that maybe that
isn’t science’s fault, but meaning’s?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Maybe the reason people are having trouble
finding meaning isn’t because science has obscured it… maybe it’s just
revealed it isn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Do you really believe your life is
meaningless?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t know. But as a scientist I have to
consider that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: And yet you’re willing to die for this cause,
the one thing that’s given your life a sense of purpose. Don’t you see
the contradiction here – ?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s getting late…</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What are you so afraid of, Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: You’re shaking. You’re the paradox here,
Ellie. So incredibly brilliant, and yet… What does it feel like to
understand everything in the universe except yourself?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s late. We should go back.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … With the machine nearing completion and
final testing beginning next week, tomorrow’s round of closed-door
I.S.C. candidate interviews would bring to a close this long chapter of
the machine drama…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … Another question I would ask would be a
very simple one. How did you do it? How did you evolve as far as you
have and not destroy yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we
don’t like the answer?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What if their answer is, ‘Oh, that’s easy. A
thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out
of control, violent crime, no food… so we called a general council and
decided to eliminate the anit-social. The weak. The sick. The unwanted.
And ever since we’ve been doing great.’</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: I think Reverend Joss raises an
excellent point. I believe we should discuss the formation of a panel to
review any potentially delicate communications before… am I amusing you,
Dr. Arroway?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You kill me, you really do. The first truly
global, a-political event in history and you can’t wait to spin it.</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: How would you propose we handle
it, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I guess I’d say I trust us enough to believe
our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice,
but no thanks. But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason
–</p>
<p><strong>project official</strong>: Nobody is proposing we censor the
truth here, Doctor. We’re simply talking about putting a mechanism in
place –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: For managing the truth. But the truth won’t
be managed, sir. It stops being the truth the moment you try.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t claim to be a perfect example of the
human species… far from it. But I think, paradoxically, that’s my
strength as a candidate. Because I think we need to share the truth of
who we are with them – our strengths –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – and our weaknesses. To go to them openly,
nakedly, and say these are our dreams, these are our fears. What I’m
saying, ladies and gentlemen, is that I believe we should make this
journey with honesty and integrity or not at all.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you today
not only as a scientist, but as a politician – an occupation for which I
make no apologies. With all due respect to Doctor Arroway’s talk of
naked honesty and integrity – high ideals, to be sure – I believe it
would be foolish and, in fact, dangerous to ignore the fact that what we
are dealing with here is a political situation – the most political of
situations – and one that must be examined in that context.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: The image we put forth, the impressions we
give may determine precedent for decades if not millennia to come.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: We must be optimistic enough to hope for
the best – and wise and experienced enough to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen. I’m proud of what
we’ve achieved as a species and a civilization. I would hate to see all
that we stand for, all that we’ve fought for for a thousand generations,
slighted, taken advantage of, or God forbid, done in by the fact that at
the final hour we chose to send a representative who didn’t put our best
interests first.</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: I am become death; the destroyer of
worlds. I wonder if this is how Oppenheimer felt on the eve of the first
A-bomb test.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’d say this is slightly different.</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: Perhaps. But on the off-chance that it
is a ‘doomsday device’ of some kind, I plan to be very far away from
your lovely Texas when it is activated.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I thought you were here because you want to
go.</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: I do. More than anything. But I am also
a realist. Soon this… what is your charming term – ? Dog and pony show
will finally be over, and I will go home.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re implying that the whole selection
process is a sham?</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: I think it is your naivete I like best
about you, Eleanor. Oh, there’ll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew
it from the very beginning. You Americans discovered the signal, you led
the decryption effort. The machine is being built on your home soil… Of
course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans. Anyway,
it is what the whole world wants, no? This is the big show. The sort you
put on better than anyone. It’s good marketing. It’s good casting. It’s
the American way.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: It’s not even close. Arroway may be a good,
even great scientist, but she’s politically tone-deaf and a loose
cannon. She leaked the message without so much as a nod to the D.O.D. or
N.S.C., and I don’t think anybody here would say diplomacy’s her strong
suit. Drumlin may not be as glamorous a choice, but he’s reliable,
patriotic, sound. He has impeccable scientific credentials. And I think
he’d be perceived by the public as the safer choice.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s her discovery, Ms. President. She
deserves to go.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I’ve been watching and getting to know Eleanor
Arroway for some time now… and I can say unequivocally, that I have
never before met a human being with such extraordinary faith. In
humanity… and in our right to a place of importance in the cosmos.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I believe that the person we’re selecting will
play a crucial role in humanity’s future. I believe that when this
person comes back – if they come back – they will be seen as being
anointed by a higher intelligence, and may well emerge as one of the
most important people on Earth. It may be true that Eleanor Arroway is
not a perfect human being – but I believe her honesty, her purity, and
her integrity to be unimpeachable. Ms. President – aren’t those
qualities that this representative should embody? Are we seriously
considering choosing a man who openly claims that he stands for nothing
more than political self-interest to be the one person to represent the
human race?</p>
<p><strong>secretary general</strong>: The International Selection
Committee has come to a decision, ladies and gentlemen, and may I say, I
think it has been a great oversight on the part of the Vegans not to
build a few more seats on the boat… But only one human being can go, and
that person, the person we feel best represents the world, is the
candidate from the United States of America, Doctor David Drumlin.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: You aren’t staying?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This… seemed best.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Right. Well.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Good luck, David.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Ellie… we both know that if I was any kind
of a man, I never would’ve entered this race. That I would have told the
President straight out: Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and
an enormous pain in the ass… but she’s got more courage and intelligence
than the rest of us put together. That more then anyone else on the
planet, she’s earned this. And that she should be the one to go because
she’s the best we have. But that’s not who I am. I like to think it’s
who I might’ve been if things had gone a different way; that I might
have been worthy, really worthy of what I’ve been given… You do what you
have to do. And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.
And it isn’t fair…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What would you have me say, David?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank you?</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: For giving me a chance, just for a moment,
to feel what it must be like to be you.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What can I get you, pretty lady?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Beer, please.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How far away are we from –</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Two hundred miles.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: What we do, we do for the good of all
mankind. This will not be understood, not now, but the apocalypse to
come will vindicate our faith…</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s so… small.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Poor, tired, spinning girl… How we feasted
on her. And now that we’ve had our fill and given her a giant dose of
the clap… we’re pulling out. That’s Paris, where my daughter was born.
Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking. So many
battles, so many lives… all that sturm, and drang. As if it never
happened. If it weren’t for a few power grids, you wouldn’t know we
existed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Japanese squid fleet. They use lights to
attract them to the surface… then turn them into sushi.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It looks like pixie dust… Kent would’ve given
anything to see this. David, too.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Yes. A shame. Still… it’d be worse if they
died for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What are you talking about? It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Oh, not quite yet. At least for their sake…
… I hope it’s not. Because they’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You sound like Joseph. You think the world
ends with the millennium?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: I think whoever sent the message did it
because they’re worried about us.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The gods sent us the machine because they
took pity on us.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Wouldn’t you if you saw Hitler on TV? Come;
I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Hokkaido Island.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The systems integration site.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Mmm. Look closer.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: As each component was tested and shipped off
to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido – for
backup purposes, of course. We’ve been right behind you the entire time.
You see my problem: I couldn’t appear to control too large a percentage;
my enemies wouldn’t stand for it. So I simply made sure the Japanese
consortium received the systems integration contract. Of course no one
had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired,
wholly-owned subsidiaries –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – of Hadden Industries.</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Want to take a ride?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why don’t you come back with me?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: Can’t. Doctor’s orders. The low oxygen/zero
gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me
alive. It’s all right – I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?</p>
<p><strong>hadden</strong>: One more thing, Doctor. If you do meet these
Vegans…? Ask them if we have to die.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … it would be fair to say an upbeat
atmosphere prevails here; the Japanese playing their role of host
impeccably.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: And there is reason for optimism: the way
the machine consortium has bounced back in these last few months is
nothing short of miraculous, and that restored sense of hope and purpose
is clearly in evidence here today.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: But look beneath the surface and you can
clearly sense a darker mood here – an undercurrent of apprehension and
fear as tomorrow approaches. And questions: What awaits the world at the
end of the long road to Hokkaido? What will happen when the machine is
finally activated? And what must Eleanor Arroway be feeling on this,
what may well be her last night on Planet Earth…?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: You didn’t think I was going to let you leave
without saying good-bye…</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie… the last time we spoke… I said some
things…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet
and entirely less than tactful… Sound like anyone you know?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: So. The final countdown.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The final countdown.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Oh. I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: During the crusades – pilgrims who made the
journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they’d
actually been there. I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now
your holy land, so…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: You’re trembling.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I do seem to be… Maybe because I’m just a
little bit terrified about tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Maybe that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry – I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I can’t do this –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What are you so afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Please, Palmer – if you care for me at all,
don’t push this now –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What are my other options? In fifty years?
Never?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Please –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I’m in love with you, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Don’t you understand? I just have to hold it
together – just until tomorrow –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: And then what? Then you’ll be safe?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Do you really think your life is meaningless,
Eleanor? Is that why you’re so quick to risk it – because if your life
means nothing then you have nothing to lose?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I can’t hear this now –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie, there is no reason you have to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And yet that’s always how I seem to end up,
isn’t it? If you really do love me, Palmer, you’ll leave. Now.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>female computer voice</strong>: Activation T-minus O-seven
hundred and counting –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: – The security here in Hokkaido has
been incredibly tight; for obvious reasons only a single pool feed has
been allowed at the machine site. Through the eye of the camera
world…</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: … watches, holding its breath for that
moment, now less than ten minutes away, when a single human being –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: – boarding a machine of unknown origin
and unknown function, will step into history…</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: … the question that’s on everyone’s
mind: will history repeat itself?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: With a piece of engineering this
complex, this unprecedented –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: – with so many unknown variables –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: – could the unthinkable occur? Could
what happened in Texas happen again?</p>
<p><strong>female computer voice</strong>: T-minus five minutes and
counting.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Cutting to the feed now.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Someone tell me this is really happening.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s really happening.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That you, Valerian?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Like it. Almost there.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s one small step for a woman…</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: Arroway, this is command control; do you
copy?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Arroway to control; reading you five by
five.</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: Showing green across the board. All systems
go…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: I’m not sure. We have no launch protocol;
the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Anything happening in there, El?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Not so far – but –</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: What the hell –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: We have benzel activation, repeat, we have
benzel activation. Control to Arroway, you okay in there? Repeat,
Control to Arroway, come back.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Arroway to Control, come in. Arroway to
Control, do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: We’ve lost contact.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Pull the plug. Get her out of there.</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: There’s no plug to pull.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: There is no abort procedure – we don’t know
how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Control, I’m going to continue broadcasting
on the assumption… hope… that you can hear me. The atmosphere within the
chamber seems to be undergoing some sort of spontaneous state
conversion…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: My breathing seems normal…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What was that – ?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m falling… sense of enormous acceleration.
It’s a wormhole, it’s got to be, but how do they keep it stable? The
energy required –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s a star, I’m in orbit around a star,
spectral type A, maybe early F. Getting weird multiple images here;
relativity effects? Accretion disk… gotta be Vega, only… oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: They’re talking to the whole universe… Okay,
okay, clearly artificial, some sort of relay station but the scale is
just… tens of thousands of receivers, hundreds… some sort of
biotechnology, like the machine but… don’t see anything like a docking
port…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Another wormhole? Bigger this time – oh God
–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Okay. Okay. A series of wormholes, linked
together, artificially created, but why would…? Jesus, it’s a subway
system.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Quadruple system… incredible… don’t recognize
any background constellations… hundreds, possibly thousands of light
years from Earth now. So beautiful. So…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The physics must be a thousand, ten thousand
years beyond us but… oh God… oh God something’s… happening…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s beautiful. It’s beautiful. I keep saying
that but I can’t… my mind can’t… words… should’ve sent a poet. I’m a
poet and don’t know it… Ground control to Major Tom… Relativitistic
side-effect? Or – induced by the transport medium? The gas…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, Palmer, I wish I’d had a baby.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The center of the galaxy…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Docking ports… those are docking ports for
other machines… hi, everybody…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Now arriving Grand Central Station… floating
down… floating… Twinkle twinkle… little star… how I wonder… ellemenopee…
… have to stay awake… stay awake… Please… please…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I… remember this…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Recording… check, check. Recording, is this
on? I think this is on.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Okay. I’ve traveled thirty thousand light
years, give or take a few parsecs, to go to the beach. So… Either
they’ve created this environment… or the illusion of this environment,
to make me feel at home… or else somehow I am at home – or else this is
my cage at the intergalactic zoo and the tour bus will be along any
minute…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Or else, of course, I’m completely insane.
This should not be discounted as a possibility – although the fact that
I’m questioning my sanity should be a pretty good indication that I am
in fact sane… unless of course… unless…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Morning, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I used… I used to dream you were alive… and
then I’d wake up and lose you all over again.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you,
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Dad… But tell me, how did… I mean how
can…?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re not real. None of this is.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s my scientist.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little
gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that
about anything.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But you’re so… I mean how could you
possibly…? When I was unconscious. You… downloaded… my thoughts, my
memories, even… This beach. I’ve never been here but I remember… it’s
how I always imagined… Pensacola.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: We thought this might make things a little
easier.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … although this is nice too.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So who – what – are you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Originally just another species like
yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Can you show me?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Small moves, Captain, small moves.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why did you contact us?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You contacted us. We were simply listening.
We’ve been listening for millions of years.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And those other docking ports I saw… I mean…
there are others?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Many others.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And they all travel here through this
wormhole subway system you built.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, we didn’t build it. The transit system has
been in place for billions of years; we’re just its… caretakers.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So who…?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: We don’t know. Whoever they were, they were
gone long before we ever got here.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The scale… it’s just… So all the
civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream
their dreams. Some never make it this far.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So we passed some kind of test?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You have your mother’s hands… There are no
tests, Ellie. We don’t sit in judgment. Think of us more as… librarians.
Curators of the Universe’s rarest and most valuable creation…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: As many civilizations as we’ve found, compared
to the vastness of space…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … life is unspeakably rare. So whenever we do
find another civilization, especially one that’s… struggling… We send a
message. Sometimes we can offer help. Sometimes we can’t. But we always
try. Life is simply too precious not to.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Can you help us?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re an interesting species; an interesting
mix. Capable of such exquisite dreams; such horrifying nightmares.
Technologically you’ve advanced very quickly – some think too quickly…
and yet…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re so lost. So cut off… and so sad.</p>
<p><strong>drumlin</strong>: What is it that makes you so lonely, Miss
Arroway?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Be honest, El. The truth is you really don’t
want the company.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: What does it feel like to understand
everything in the universe except yourself?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie, there is no reason you have to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: We are alone. For millions of years we’ve
searched the cosmos… and after all the suffering, after all the chaos
and desolation of the void – the one thing we’ve found that makes the
emptiness bearable is each other. That’s why I sent the message. That’s
why I made contact.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Am I one… or many?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The librarian… or the library…?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … all those voices… you gather them all
together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness… and now we’re
a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You always have been. We’re all descendants of
the same stars, Ellie. All made of the same primordial atoms.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So. What happens now?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now… you go home.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No! I mean… why so soon?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: If we don’t engineer a consistent causality
it’ll work itself out on its own, and that’s almost always worse. Ellie,
according to your physics none of this is possible. A lot of it you’re
simply not capable of understanding, not yet. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: None taken… but … do we get to come back?
Others of my kind, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Eventually you’ll get here on your own. This
was just the first step; in time you’ll take another.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But – other people from our planet should see
what I’ve seen – they should witness this for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That isn’t the way it works.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But you said you wanted to help – don’t you
see what it would mean?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No more stalling, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Please – if you… downloaded… everything about
us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have – it could
make the difference –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Ellie… this is the way it’s been done for
billions of years…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … but we’ll consider your request.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s time to go home now.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No. Please.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Childhood is over, Ellie. It’s time to grow
up.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: – Got her – !</p>
<p><strong>a.t.l.</strong>: – all benzel motion has ceased. Repeat,
benzels are stopped; securing the area –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ellie – are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m – I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thank God. When we lost contact, I thought –
we thought… but you’re okay. We’re still trying to determine the nature
of the malfunction. Did you notice anything at all that –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Wait – hold on a minute –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s all right, the important thing is you’re
safe –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter, what are you talking about? What
malfunction? What day is this?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What day?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How long was I gone?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ellie… we saw you enter the machine. The
benzels spun up, generating some sort of atmospheric disturbance. The
benzels spun down. And then… just now… you stepped out. We were out of
radio contact exactly… seven minutes and thirty- five seconds. The
machine never went anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms.
Aching joints? Fever?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m fine –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Headaches? Swollen glands?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No – could somebody please just –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Vitals identical to pre-launch stats.</p>
<p><strong>another scientist</strong>: No sign of radiation or
biological contamination of any kind. She’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter… What is going on? Has everyone gone
completely insane?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s one way of putting it. Kitz, the
President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications;
there’ve also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and
Europe. Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough,
especially for you –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But the machine worked – that’s what I’ve
been trying to tell everyone! The tape – it’s all there, if they’d just
look at… … the tape…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … I don’t understand it. All I can think is
that maybe because the video gear wasn’t accounted for in the original
plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Is that your official response?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t have an official response, Michael.
All I have are the same questions you have.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: I’m afraid that’s not a satisfactory answer,
Doctor. We spent two trillion dollars. You walked into that machine with
the hopes and prayers of an entire planet with you, and you stepped out
with nothing. Those people are going to want more than idle speculation
and conjecture – they’re going to want answers – and I hope for all our
sakes you can come up with them.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I have Mr. Kitz for you
Ms. President.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Put him through. Well?</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Nothing. Apparently the surface began to
ossify immediately after she emerged; all subsequent attempts to
re-enter the machine have failed…</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: … as have all attempts at internal analysis.
We’ve tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it’s completely
impenetrable.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Recommendations?</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe we built the damn thing
wrong. Maybe it was all a hoax… The safest thing would probably be to do
a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.</p>
<p><strong>president lasker</strong>: Have your department make a full
report.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Oh, Ellie…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m assuming you read my deposition.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: It was quite a page turner.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way
to the center of the galaxy… Just to find you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So. I’m assuming they sent you here to
administer last rites?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I’m not sure it’s come to that.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: They don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re sure you want to? In the universe I
saw we’re not exactly the stars of the show. What happened to me makes
us all seem pretty damn small.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: It also makes God enormous. I think of the
scope of your universe, Ellie… and it takes my breath away. As it will
everyone else’s.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t have any proof, Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie, you’re the proof. You tell them your
story. Ultimately they’ll have no choice but to believe you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s not enough, don’t you understand? I know
it happened – but by every standard of science, by every standard I’ve
lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true
but it doesn’t matter because I can’t prove it’s real.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie, the only one holding you to that
standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear
it!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Have you seen what’s happening out there? The
terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie. People need something
they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I want to, Palmer – more than anything. But
it has to be real. It has to be true.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Ellie… if you go out there like this – if you
admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn’t actually
happen – I’m afraid they really will crucify you. Please. For your own
sake, for the sake of the world… tell them what you know to be the
truth. Tell them it really happened.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: They’re ready for you.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: You were in the machine for seven minutes,
thirty-five seconds, is that correct, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Earth time, yes.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Earth time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Senator… I believe I traveled through a
series of wormholes. Wormholes are a phenomenon deduced by Einstein;
they’re essentially tears in the fabric of space/time. Because of the
effects of relativity what I experienced as a period of approximately
eighteen hours passed almost instantaneously on Earth. To you I seemed
to depart and arrive back at the same moment.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Doctor, isn’t it true that wormholes are
merely predictions of relativity theory? That there’s no evidence they
actually exist?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: There is no direct evidence, no.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: And current theory holds that to sustain the
sort of wormholes you’re talking about, even for a fraction of a second,
would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that
correct?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t have the figures in front of me, but
yes, that sounds about right.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: In fact, by all the laws of physics we know
what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: By our standards… yes.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: … And this is how the extraterrestrial
presented himself to you? As your father?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: He died… … in 1972.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Dr. Arroway, do you think it’s possible
you had some kind of… delusional episode.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Is it possible…?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: All the elements are there. A woman,
orphaned young, under a great deal of stress. The failure of a project
she’s staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on – induces a
fantasy of reuniting with her ‘father in heaven’ as it were. Is it
possible?</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Please answer the question, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Is it possible. Yes. But –</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Thank you, Doctor. Now –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – but I don’t believe it to be the truth.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: You don’t believe it to be… tell me
something, Doctor. Why do you think they would go to all this trouble…
bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home
without a shred of proof? Sort of bad form, wouldn’t you say? What was
their intent?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t know. Ultimately their motives may be
as incomprehensible as their technology.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Dr. Arroway, you come before us with no
evidence. No records, no artifacts – only a story that – to put I mildly
– strains credibility. Over two trillion dollars was spent, hundreds of
lives were lost, many more may be in jeopardy due to the almost
incalculable worldwide psychological impact… Are you going to sit there
and tell us that we should simply take this all on faith?</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: Answer the question, Doctor. As a scientist –
can you prove any of this?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kitz</strong>: So why don’t you admit what by your own
standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn’t
happen.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Because I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I had… an experience. I can’t prove it. I
can’t even explain it. All I can tell you is that everything I know as a
human being, everything I am – tells me that it was real.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I was given something wonderful. Something
that changed me. A vision of the universe that made it overwhelmingly
clear just how tiny and insignificant – and at the same time how rare
and precious we all are. A vision… that tells us we belong to something
greater than ourselves… that we’re not – that none of us – is alone.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I wish I could share it. I wish everyone, if
only for a moment – could feel that sense of awe, and humility… and
hope. That continues to be my wish.</p>
<p><strong>zealot</strong>: ‘… He dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set
up on the Earth, and the top of it reached to heaven… Surely the Lord is
in this place, and I knew it not. This is none other but the House of
God.’</p>
<p><strong>people</strong>: Ellie… Bless me, Ellie… Heal me…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Reverend Joss, do you think the failure of
the machine is God’s rebuke to science?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: As a person of faith… I am bound by a
different covenant than Dr. Arroway – but I believe our goal is one and
the same: the pursuit of the truth. I think today Dr. Arroway continued
that pursuit under the most trying of conditions.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … but it is a good question, and I suppose
I’ll always wonder about the answer: Why would they send me back without
proof?</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Maybe what you experienced can’t be reduced to
images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only
in their own way, in their own time… Or maybe it’s just like you said:
ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their
technology.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: In other words, God works in mysterious
ways…</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: In other words.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t know. If it was a god, it was
searching for a greater one. It was still searching for meaning…</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Does that mean you think it doesn’t exist?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m not sure… Maybe it simply exists in the
search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>joss</strong>: Meaning…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Something my dad – they – said. ‘After all
the suffering, after all the desolation of the void – the one thing that
makes the vastness tolerable is each other.’ The one thing that makes it
bearable is love.</p>
<p><strong>bbc reporter</strong>: … and while the riots here in London
continue for the fourth night in a row, on the other side of the
Atlantic the news is equally grim…</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: … thousands of starving refugees fled
the area as the bloody fighting continued…</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: … a massive book burning took place in
downtown Berlin today…</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: … and on this last night of the old
millennium and the eve of the new one, looking back on a past racked by
violence and chaos, we of the human race look ahead to an uncertain
future – a future which, at least for now, seems to promise only more of
the same…</p>
