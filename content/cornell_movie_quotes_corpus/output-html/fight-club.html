<h1 id="fight-club">fight-club</h1>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: People were always asking me, did I know Tyler
Durden.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: One minute. This is the beginning. We’re at
ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … i… ann….iinn.. ff….nnyin…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: With a gun barrel between your teeth, you only
speak in vowels.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t think of anything.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: With my tongue, I can feel the rifling in the
barrel. For a second, I totally forgot about Tyler’s whole controlled
demolition thing and I wondered how clean this gun is.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: It’s getting exciting now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That old saying, how you always hurt the one
you love, well, it works both way.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We have front row seats for this Theater of
Mass Destruction. The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped
the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin. In two
minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings
will be reduced to smoldering rubble. I know this because Tyler knows
this.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Look what we’ve accomplised. Thirty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Somehow, I realize all of this – the gun, the
bombs, the revolution – is really about Marla Singer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob had bitch tits.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This was a support group for men with
testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’re still men.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. We’re men. Men is what we are.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Six months ago, Bob’s testicles were removed.
Then hormone therapy. He developed bitch tits because his testosterone
was too high and his body upped the estrogen. That was where my head fit
– into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of
God’s as big.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They’re gonna have to open my pec’s again to
drain the fluid.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay. You cry now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For six months. I could not sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: With insomnia, nothing is real. Everything is
far away. Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When deep space exploration ramps up, it will
be corporations that name everything. The IBM Stellar Sphere. The Philip
Morris Galaxy. Planet Starbucks.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: I’m going to need you out-of-town a little
more this week. We’ve got some “red-flags” to cover.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It must’ve been Tuesday. he was wearing his
“cornflower-blue” tie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You want me to de-prioritize my current
reports until you advise of a status upgrade?</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: You need to make these your primary “action
items.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He was full of pep. Must’ve had his grande
latte enema.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Here are your flight coupons. Call me from the
road if there are any snags. Your itinerary…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like everyone else, I had become a slave to
the IKEA nesting instinct.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. I’d like to order the Erika Pekkari slip
covers.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I saw something like clever coffee table
sin the shape of a yin and yang, I had to have it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like the Johanneshov armchair in the Strinne
green stripe pattern…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Even the Vild hall clock of galvanized steel,
resting on the Klipsk shelving unit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I would flip through catalogs and wonder,
“What kind of dining set defines me as a person?” We used to read
pornography. Now it was the Horchow Collection.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I don’t want Cobalt. Oh, that sounds nice.
Apricot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny
bubbles and imperfections, proof they were crafted by the honest,
simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of wherever.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: No, you can’t die of insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe I died already. Look at my face.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: You need to lighten up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can’t you give me something?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
Seconals.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew
valerian root and get some more exercise.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m in pain.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: You want to see pain? Swing by First
Methodist Tuesday nights. See the guys with testicular cancer. That’s
pain.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: I… wanted three kids. Two boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted two girls and one boy. We never could agree on
anything.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Well, she had her first child a month ago,
a girl, with her new husband… And, Thank God. I’m glad for her, because
she deserves…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Everyone, let’s thank Thomas for sharing
himself with us.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Thank you, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I look around this room and I see a lot of
courage. And it gives me strength. We give each other strength.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: It’s time for the one-on-one. Let’s follow
Thomas’s example and open ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Can everyone find a partner?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The big moosie, his eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears. Knees together, invisible steps.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob was a champion bodybuilder. You know that
chest expansion program you see on TV? That was his idea.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: …using steroids. I was a juicer. Diabonol,
then, Wisterol – it’s for racehorses, for Christsake. Now I’m bankrupt,
divorced, my two grown kids won’t return my calls…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go
a big rubbery one.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Go ahead, Cornelius. You can cry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then… something happened. I was lost in
oblivion – dark and silent and complete.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I found freedom. Losing all hope was
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Babies don’t sleep this well.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I became addicted.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I didn’t say anything, people assumed the
worst. They cried harder. I cried harder.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Tonight, we’re going to open the green door
– the heart chakra…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I wasn’t really dying, I wasn’t host to cancer
or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world
crowded around.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: …And you open the door and you step inside.
We’re inside our hearts. Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of
healing light. That’s right, the pain itself is a ball of healing
light.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: It moves over your body, healing you. Keep
this going and step forward, through the back door of the room. Where
does it lead? To your cave. Step forward into your cave.</p>
<p><strong>leader’s voice</strong>: That’s right. You’re going deeper
into your cave. And you’re going to find your power animal…</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Slide.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Every evening I died and every evening I was
born again. Resurrected.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob loved me because he thought my testicles
were removed too. Being there, my face against his tits, ready to cry –
this was my vacation.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And, she ruined everything.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: This is cancer, right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This … chick … Marla Singer … did not have
testicular cancer. She was a liar.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She had no diseases at all. I had seen her at
my melanoma Monday night group …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … and at “Free and Clear,” my blood parasites
group Thursdays.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – And, again, at “Seize The Day,” my
tuberculosis Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla – the big tourist. Her lie reflected my
lie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn’t cry.
So, once again, I could not sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I just can’t believe that card is declined
– Okay, okay, let me give you a different card number.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Next group, after guided meditation, after we
open our chakras, when it’s time to hug, I’m going to grab that little
bitch, Marla Singer, pin her arms against her sides and say…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla, you liar, you big tourist. I need this.
Get out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When you have insomnia, you’re never really
asleep and you’re never really awake. I hadn’t slept in four days…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – But, in here, in everyone, there’s the
squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be
positive. They never said “parasite;” they said “agent.” They always
talked about getting better.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Okay, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: To open tonight’s communion, Chloe would
like to say a few words.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ahh, Chloe. Chloe looked the way Joni
Mitchell’s skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around a
party being extra nice to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Well, I’m still here – but I don’t know for
how long. That’s as much certainty as anyone can give me. but I’ve got
some good news – I no longer have any fear of death.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: But… I am in a pretty lonely place. No one
will have sex with me. I’m so close to the end and all I want is to get
laid for the last time. I have pornographic movies in my apartment, and
lubricants and amyl nitrate …</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Thank you, Chloe. Everyone, let’s thank
Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Thank you, Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Now, you’re standing at the entrance to your
cave. You step inside your cave and you walk. Keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I did have a tumor, I’d name it Marla.
Marla…the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if
only you could stop tonguing it, but you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Now, find your power animal.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Slide.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Pick someone special to you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Hello, Mr. Tayler.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I never gave my real name at support
groups.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi, Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: We’ve never actually talked.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You look good. You … look … like a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excuse me, I have to…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m on to you. You’re a faker. You aren’t
dying.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way,
we’re all dying. But you’re not dying the way Chloe is dying.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Tell the other person how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re a tourist. I saw you at melanoma,
tuberculosis and testicular cancer.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: And I saw you practicing this…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Practicing what?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Telling me off. Is it going as well as you
hoped… ? “… Mr. Taylor.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll expose you.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Go ahead. I’ll expose you.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Share yourself completely.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: It’s cheaper than a movie, and there’s free
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: These are my groups. I was here first. I’ve
been coming for a year.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: A year? How’d you manage that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anyone who might’ve noticed either died or
recovered and never came back.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Let yourself cry.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Why do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I… I don’t know. I guess… when people think
you’re dying, they really listen, instead…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: – Instead of just waiting for their turn to
speak.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Quietly, now. Share with each other.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It becomes an addiction.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, I can’t cry with a faker present.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It’s not my
problem.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please. Can’t we do something… ?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Now, the closing prayer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll split up the week. You can have
lymphoma, tuberculosis and –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn’t go
over at all.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think testicular cancer should be no
contest.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Well, technically, I have more of a right to
be there than you. You still have your balls.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I don’t know – am I?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I’ll take the parasites.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can’t have both parasites. You can take
blood parasites –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I want brain parasites.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. I’ll take blood parasites and organic
brain dementia –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I want that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can’t have the whole brain!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: So far, you have four and I only have
two!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then, take blood parasites. It’s yours. Now we
each have three.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You… left half your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re selling those?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Yes, I’m selling some chothes.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: So, we each have three – that’s six. What
about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The girl had done her homework.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I want ascending bowel cancer.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: That’s your favorite, too? Tried to slip it
by me, eh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll split it. You get it the first and third
Sunday of the month.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Looks like this is goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s not make a big thing out of it.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: How’s this for not making a big thing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Um… Marla, should we maybe exchange
numbers?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Should we?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: In case we want to switch nights.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: It doesn’t have your name. Who are you?
Cornelius? Mr. Taylor? Dr. Zaius? Any of the stupid names you give each
night?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is how I met Marla Singer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wake up at O’Hare.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wake up at SeaTac.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Check-in for that flight doesn’t begin
for another two hours, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pacific, Mountain, Central. Lose an hour, gain
an hour. This is your life, and it’s ending one minute at a time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wake up at Air Harbor International.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you wake up at a different time and in a
different place, could you wake up as a different person?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everywhere I travel – tiny life.
Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream, single pat of butter.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shampoo/conditioner combo. Single- serving
mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The people I meet on each flight – they’re
single-serving friends. Between take-off and landing, we have our time
together, but that’s all we get.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wake up at Logan.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: On a long enough time line, the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m a recall coordinator. My job is to apply
the formula. It’s a story problem.</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: Here’s where the infant went through
the windshield. Three points.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A new car built by my company leaves somewhere
traveling at 60 miles per hour. The rear differential locks up.</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: The teenager’s braces around the
backseat ashtray would make a good “anti-smoking” ad.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The car crashes and burns with everyone
trapped inside. Now: do we initiate a recall?</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: The father must’ve been huge. See how
the fat burnt into the driver’s seat with his polyester shirt? Very
“modern art.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Take the number of vehicles in the field, ,
and multiply it by the probable rate of failure, , then multiply the
result by the average out-of-court settlement, . A times B times C
equals X…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If X is less than the cost of a recall, we
don’t do one.</p>
<p><strong>busisness woman</strong>: Are there a lot of these kinds of
accidents?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, you wouldn’t believe.</p>
<p><strong>business woman</strong>: … Which… car company do you work
for?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A major one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Every time the plane banked too sharply on
take-off or landing, I prayed for a crash, or a mid-air collision –
anything.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No more haircuts. Nothing matters, not even
bad breath.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a
business trip.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There are three ways to make napalm. One, mix
equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.
Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is how I met –</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Tyler Durden.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You know why they have oxygen masks on
planes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, supply oxygen?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic
emergency, we’re taking giant, panicked breaths…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Suddenly, we become euphoic and docile. We
accept our fate.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Emergency water landing, 600 miles per hour.
Blank faces – calm as Hindu cows.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you do, Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I mean – for a living.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why? So you can say, “Oh, that’s what you
do.” – And be a smug little shit about it?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You have a kind of sick desperation in your
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We have the same briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Soap – the yardstick of civilization. I make
and sell soap…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: If you were to add nitric acid to the
soap-making process, one would get nitroglycerin. With enough soap, one
could blow up the world, if one were so inclined.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
“single-serving” friend I’ve ever met.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You see, when you travel, everything is small,
self-contained–</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The spork. I get it. You’re very clever.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: How’s that working out for you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Being clever.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, uh… great.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: … As I squeeze past, do I give you the ass or
the crotch?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We are defined by the choices we make.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How I came to live with Tyler is: airlines
have this policy about vibrating luggage.</p>
<p><strong>security tfm</strong>: Throwers don’t worry about ticking.
Modern bombs don’t tick.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excuse me? “Throwers?”</p>
<p><strong>security tfm</strong>: Baggage handlers. But when a suitcase
vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My suitcase was vibrating?</p>
<p><strong>security tfm</strong>: Nine time out of ten, it’s an electric
razor. But, every once in a while … …it’s a dildo. It’s airline policy
not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. We use the indefinite
aricle: “A dildo.” Never “Your dildo.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts…
my D.K.N.Y. shoes…</p>
<p><strong>security tfm</strong>: Yeah, uh huh… yeah? Oh…</p>
<p><strong>security tfm</strong>: I’m terribly sorry.</p>
<p><strong>security tfm</strong>: You know the industry slang for
“Flight Attendant?” “Air Mattress.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Home was a condo on the fifteenth floor of a
filing cabinet for widows and young professionals. The walls were solid
concrete. A foot of concrete is important when your next- door neighbor
lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – Or when a volcanic blast of debris that used
to be your furniture and personal effects blows out your floor-
to-ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: There’s nothing up there.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You can’t go into the unit. Police
orders.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Do you have somebody you can call?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The police would later tell me that the pilot
light might have gone out… letting out just a little bit of gas.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Lots of young people try to impress the
world and buy too many things.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The gas could have slowly filled the condo.
Seventeen-hundred square feet with high ceilings, for days and days.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Many young people feel trapped and
desperate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then, the refrigerator’s compressor could have
clicked on…</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: If you don’t know what you want, you end up
with a lot you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you asked me now, I couldn’t tell you why I
called him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>tyler’s voice</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>tyler’s voice</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh… I’m sorry. We met on the plane. We had the
same briefcase. I’m… you know, the clever guy.</p>
<p><strong>tyler’s voice</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I just called a second ago. There was no
answer. I’m at a payphone.</p>
<p><strong>tyler’s voice</strong>: I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick
up my phone. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well… let me see… here’s the thing…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is
the last sofa I’ll ever need. No matter what else happens, I’ve got the
sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right
dinette.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This is how we fill up our lives.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: And, now it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All gone.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Could be worse. A woman could cut off your
penis while you’re asleep and toss it out the window of a moving
car.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s always that.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe it’s a
terrible tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …no …no …</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat
little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I
right?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: But maybe, just maybe, you’ve been
delivered.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Delivered from Swedish furniture.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Delivered from armchairs in obscure green
stripe patterns.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Delivered from Martha Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Delivered from bullshit colors like “Cobalt,”
“Ebony,” and “Fuchsia.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Insurance’ll cover it.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
list.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What list?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The “now I get to go out and buy the exact
same stuff all over again” list. That list.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t… think so.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You’ll
be occupied for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I have to file a claim…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The things you own, they end up owning
you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Do what you like.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: God, it’s late. I should find a hotel…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: A hotel?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: So, you called me up, because you just wanted
to have a drink before you… go find a hotel?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t follow…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We’re on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask
me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You called me so you could have a place to
stay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why don’t you cut the shit and ask if you can
stay at my place?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Would that be a problem?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Is it a problem for you to ask?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can I stay at your place?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re welcome. But, I want you to do me one
favor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler
Durden.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler was a night person. He sometimes worked
as a projectionist. A movie doesn’t come in one big reel, it’s on a few.
In old theaters, two projectors are used, so someone has to change
projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel
begins. Sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand
corner…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: They’re called “cigarette burns.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s called a “changeover.” The movie goes on,
and nobody in the audience has any idea.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why would anyone want this shitty job?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It affords him other interesting
opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: – Like splicing single frames from adult
movies into family films.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: In reel three, right after the courageous dog
and the snooty cag – who have celebrity voices – eat out of a garbage
can, there’s the flash of Tyler’s contribution…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: One-forty-eighth of a second. That’s how long
it’s up there.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No one really knows that they’ve seen it. But
they did.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: A nice, big cock.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at
work.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter at the
luxurious Pressman Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food
service industry.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Don’t watch. I can’t if you watch.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: … Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised
endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Go ahead. Say it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know about this.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I don’t know, either. I want to find out.
I’ve never been hit, have you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. That’s a good thing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I don’t want to die without any scars. How
much can you really know about yourself if you’ve never been in a fight?
Come on… you’re the only person I’ve ever asked.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why not you? I’m letting you go first. Do
it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Alright, go crazy. Let ’er rip.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where do you want it? In the face?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit. Sorry. That didn’t count.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Like hell. That counted.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Strange.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: But a good strange.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We’ve crossed the threshold. You want to call
it off?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Call what off?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The fight.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What fight?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This fight, pussy.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: If you could fight anyone… one on one,
whoever you wanted, who would you fight?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My boss, probably. Who would you fight?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: My dad. No question.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, yeah. I didn’t know my dad. Well, I knew
him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids.
Every six years or so he’d do it again – new city, new family.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: He was setting up franchises. My father never
went to college, so it was really important that I go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: After I graduated, I called him long distance
and asked, “Now what?” He said, “Get a job.” When I turned twenty-five,
I called him and asked, “Now what?” He said, “I don’t know. Get
married.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: A generation of men raised by women. I’m
wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We should do this again sometime.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What car?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know how Tyler found the house, but
he’d been there for half a year.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: None of the doors locked. The stairs were
ready to collapse. I didn’t know if he owned it or he was squatting.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Neither would have surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing worked. The rusty plumbing leaked.
Turning on a light meant another light in the house went out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There were no neighbors. Just warehouses and
the paper mill. The fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood
chips.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a
mile in every direction.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When it rained, we had to kill the power. By
the end of the first month, I didn’t care about TV. I didn’t mind the
warm, stale refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The previous occupant had been a bit of a
shut-in.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hum.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Oh, a new riot control grenade… “…the
successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and
simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of…blah, blah, blah…”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “I am Joe’s Lungs.” It’s written in first
person. “Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood
cells.” There’s a whole series – “I am Joe’s Prostate.”</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: “I get cancer, and I kill Joe.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New
Republic.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Show-off.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I should have been haggling with my insurance
company. I should have been looking for a new condo…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …. I should have been upset about my nice,
neat, flaming little shit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Most of the week, we were Ozzie and
Harriet.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday
night…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … we were finding something out: we were
finding out, more and more, that we were not alone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thursday mornings, all I could do was think
about next week.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The basic premise of cyber-netting your
office is – make things more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Walter, the Microsoft account exec. Walter,
with his smooth, soft hands. Maybe he was thinking about the free- range
potluck he’d been to last weekend, or his church-group car-wash
fund-raiser. Or, probably not.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I showed this already to my man here. You
liked it, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can swallow a pint of blood before you get
sick.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Jesus, I’d hate to see what happened to the
other guy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Screw Walter. His candy-ass wouldn’t last a
second Wednesday night.</p>
<p><strong>irvine</strong>: Drink up people. We’re closing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It was right in everyone’s face. Tyler and I
just made it visible.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It was on the tip of everyone’s tongue. Tyler
and I just gave it a name.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Welcome to fight club.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I
decided.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The first rule of fight club is – you don’t
talk about fight club. The second rule of fight club is – you don’t talk
about fight club. The third rule of fight club is – when someone says
“stop” or goes limp, the fight is over. Fourth rule is – only two guys
to a fight. Fifth rule – one fight at a time. Sixth rule – no shirts, no
shoes. Seventh rule – fights go on as long as they have to. And the
eighth and final rule – if this is your first night at fight club, you
have to fight.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This kid, Ricky – supply clerk – couldn’t
remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But Ricky was a god for ten minutes last week
when he trounced an actuary twice his size.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sometimes all you could hear were flat, hard
packing sounds over the yelling, or the wet choke when someone caught
their breath and sprayed…</p>
<p><strong>goateed man</strong>: Ssssstop… !</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Even if I could tell someone they had a good
fight, I wouldn’t be talking to the same man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who you were in fight club is not who you were
in the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You weren’t alive anywhere like you were
there. But fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club
starts and when fight club ends.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: What are you getting yourself into every
week?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: After fight club, everything else in your life
gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Have you finished those reports?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The people who had power over you have less
and less.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: By this point, I could wiggle most of the
teeth in my jaw.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A guy came to fight club for the first time,
his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out
of wood.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you could fight any celebrity?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Alive or dead?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hemingway. You?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shatner. William Shatner.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We all started seeing things differently.
Wherever we went.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I felt sorry for all the guys packing into
gyms, trying to look like what Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said they
should.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Self-improvement is masturbation.
Self-destruction is the answer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You could take him.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The trick is not to care.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fight club wasn’t about winning or losing. It
wasn’t about words.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They hysterical shouting was in tongues, like
at a Pentecostal church.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … stop…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When the fight was over, nothing was solved,
but nothing mattered.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>opponent</strong>: How about next week?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look at me. How about next month?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Afterwards, we all felt saved.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: He fell down some stairs.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I fell down some stairs.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fight club became the reason to cut your hair
short and trim your fingernails.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Any historical figure.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay… Ghandi.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Good answer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight
till they’re burger.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Remember, even the Mona Lisa’s falling
apart.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Where have you been the last few weeks?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: The forwarding number. I haven’t seen you at
any support groups.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s the idea – we split them.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You haven’t been going to yours.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I found a new one.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s for men.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Like testicular cancer?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, this is a bad time…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I’ve been going to debtor’s anonymous. You
want to see some truly fucked up people?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m just on my way out…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Me too. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took
what was left of a bottle. Might’ve been too much.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw
herself around her crummy apartment.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: This isn’t a for-real suicide thing. This is
probably one of those cry-for- help things.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This could go on for hours.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So you’re staying in tonight?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Do you want to wait to hear me describe
death?</p>
<p><strong>marla’s voice</strong>: Do you want to listen and see if my
spirit can use the telephone?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler’s door was closed. I’d been living here
two months, and Tyler’s door was never closed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re not going to believe what I dreamt last
night.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I can hardly believe anything about last
night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: She’s a piece of work. Get this – I come in
here last night, the phone’s off the hook…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I already knew the story before he told it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>marla’s voice</strong>: I’ll tell you when I’m floating out
of my body.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How could Tyler, off all people, think it was
a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You got here fast.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: The mattresses are all sealed in slippery
plastic.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Did I call you?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Don’t worry. It’s not a threat to you.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Oh, no! Somebody called the cops…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: 8-G! Where’s 8-G?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: End of the hall.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: The girl who lives there used to be a
charming, lovely girl, but she’s lost faith in herself…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Miss Singer, let us help you! You have every
reason to live!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: She’s a monster! Infectious human waste! Good
luck trying to save her!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: If I fall asleep, I’m done for. You’re gonna
have to keep me up all night.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Unbelievable, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He was obviously able to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I mean, this girl… uh, you’re not into her or
anything… ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I am Jack’s Raging Bile Duct.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Good. This chick was up on the table with her
legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The
things that she said… I’ve never heard a woman talk like that…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I want to have your abortion.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How could Tyler not go for that? Night before
last, he was splicing sex organs into “Little Mermaid.”</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re okay with this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with
my brains.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from
that one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, and my pace is more librarians.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hey… don’t knock librarians.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla doesn’t need a lover. She needs a case
worker.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: She needs an exorcist. This isn’t love. This
is sport-fucking.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’d invaded my support groups, now she’s
invading my home.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Listen… do me a favor… sit here a minute…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’ve gotta understand something about me. I
have a little rule, okay? Don’t ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can’t
stand that kind of shit.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: If you ever say anything about me or about
what happens here in this house, to her or anyone – I will find out. And
you’ll never see me again. Promise me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Promise you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I said I promise!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: That was three times you promised.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and
gone to watch Marla die, none of this would have happened.</p>
<p><strong>marla’s voice</strong>: Miserable fucking discharge!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I could’ve moved to another room, one on the
third floor – so I wouldn’t have heard them. But I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I… uh… just going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You want to finish her off?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh… nah…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I became the calm, little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I wrote little haiku poems.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I faxed them around to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Is that your blood?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Some of it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Take the rest of the day off. Come back
tomorrow with clean clothes. Get yourself together.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I got right in everyone’s hostile little face.
Yes, these are bruises from fighting. I’m comfortable with them. I am
enlightened.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You give up the condo life, give up all your
flaming worldly possessions, go live in a dilapidated house in the toxic
waste part of town…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … and you come home to this.</p>
<p><strong>tyler’s voice</strong>: You fucking slut!!</p>
<p><strong>marla’s voice</strong>: Thank you, sir, may I have another!
Thank you sir, may I have another… !</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. Speaking.</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: This is Detective Stern with the
arson unit. We have some new information about the “incident” at your
condo.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: I don’t know if you’re aware… your
front door – it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped
it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I wasn’t aware…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I am Jack’s Cold Sweat.</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: Does this sound strange to you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: The dynamite…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dynamite?</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: Yes. It left a residue of ammonium
oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: It means it was homemade.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is… really a shock…</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: Whoever set this homemade dynamite
could’ve blown out the pilot light days before the explosion. The gas,
it seems, was just a detonator.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who do you think could’ve done this?</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: I’ll ask the questions, son.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Tell him…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: “The liberator who destroyed my property has
re-aligned my paradigm of perception.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shhhhhh! I don’t know what to make of this,
sir, I really don’t…</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: Do you know anyone who’d have the
expertise or motive to do something like this?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: “I reject the basic assumptions of
civilization, including material possession.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. No, sir. I loved that condo. I loved every
stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. The dishes
were me. The plants were…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’d like to thank the academy…</p>
<p><strong>detective stern</strong>: Well, if any ideas come to you,
give me a call. In the meantime, don’t leave town. I may need to bring
you in for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Could be worse. You could be cursed with the
three terrible Karmas. You could be beautiful, rich and famous.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were
never in the same room.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I got this dress at a thrift store for one
dollar.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My parents pulled this exact act for years –
one came in, the other disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: It’s a bridesmaid’s dress. Someone loved it
intensely for one day, then tossed it. Like a Christmas tree – so
special, then, bam – it’s abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel
still clinging to it…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out,
bound with electrical tape.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It suits you.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You can borrow it sometime.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Get rid of her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You get rid of her.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Don’t mention me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m six years old again, passing messages
between my parents.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I, uh… think you should go now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s time for you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You’re such a nutcase, I can’t even begin to
keep up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: To make soap, first we have to render
fat.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The best fat for making soap – because the
salt balance is just right – comes form human bodies…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: A liposuction clinic.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Paydirt. From society’s richest asses and
thighs.</p>
<p><strong>time cut</strong>: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence,
carrying BAGS of fat. One of Jack’s bags RIPS, spilling the goo down the
chain-link fench. Jack slips and slides. Tyler laughs. Tyler tries to
scoop the running fat back into the bag.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the
surface. Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This clear layer in glycerin. We’ll mix it
back in when we make the soap.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Lye – the crucial ingredient. Ancient peoples
found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in
the river. Why? Because, human sacrifices were once made on the hills
above this river. Year after year, bodies burnt. Rain feel. Water seeped
through the wood ashes to become lye. The lye combined with the melted
fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the
river.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The first soap was made from the ashes of
heroes. Like the first monkeys shot into space.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Without sacrifice, without death, we would
have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more
than you’ve ever been burned and you will have a scar.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler’s kiss was a bonfire on the back of my
hand.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Look at your hand.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could
work for this.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Come back to the pain. Don’t shut this
out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I tried not to think of the words “searing” or
“flesh.” I imagined my pain as a ball of healing white light.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Stop it. This is your pain – your burning
hand. It’s right here. Look at it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was going to my cave to find my power
animal.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Don’t deal with this the way those dead
people do. Deal with it the way a living person does.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I… I think I understand. I think I get it…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: No, what you’re feeling is premature
enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This is the greatest moment of your life and
you’re off somewhere, missing it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God.
And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Listen to me. You have to consider the
possibility that God doesn’t like you, he never wanted you. In all
probability, He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can
happen…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It isn’t… ?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We don’t need him…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We don’t… ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Marla … ?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God’s
unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and
so be it.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You can go to the sink and run water over
your hand. Look at me. Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn,
but first you have to give up. First, you have to know that someday, you
are going to die. Until you know that, you will be useless.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You … you don’t know what this feels like,
Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Congratulations. You’re a step closer to
hitting bottom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler sold the soap to department stores at
twenty bucks a Ear. God knows what they charged. How ironic. We were
selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He was wearing a yellow tie. It must be
Thursday. I didn’t even wear a tie to work anymore.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: “The first rule of fight club is you don’t
talk about fight club.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I must’ve left the original in the copy
machine.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: “The second rule of fight club… Is this
yours?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: You don’t get paid to abuse the copy
machine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Abuse” the copy machine. There’s an
image.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Pretend you’re me. You find this. What would
you do?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me? I’d be very careful who I talked to about
this. It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it… someone who might snap
at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10
Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into
colleagues and co- workers.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Might be someone you’ve known for years…
somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn’t be bringing me every
little piece of trash you pick up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Compliance and Liability.</p>
<p><strong>marla’s voice</strong>: My tit’s going to rot off.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just a second. Could you excuse me? I need to
take this call.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Would you do something for me? I need you to
check and see if there’s a lump in my breast. I can’t afford to throw
money away on a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know …</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She didn’t call Tyler. I’m neutral in her
book.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is a sweet side of you. Picking these up
for … “Mrs. Haniver” and… “Mrs. Raines.” Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Tragically, they’re dead. I’m alive and I’m
in poverty. You want any?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where? Here?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Feel anything?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Make sure.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. Okay, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You feel nothing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Well, that’s a relief. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… no problem.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I wish I could return the favor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think everything’s okay here.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I could check your prostate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh … nah.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Well… thanks, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So…. are we done?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Yeah, we’re done. See you around.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Cornelius! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob. I’m okay. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Better than I’ve ever been in my life.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Really? Great. Still “Remaining Men
Together?”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No. I found something new.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Really, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The first rule is… you aren’t supposed to talk
about it…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And the second rule about it is… you’re not
supposed to talk about it. And the third rule…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob, Bob… I’m a member.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You are?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look at my face.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s a fucking great, man! Fucking great!
Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, both of us.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know about the guy who invented it? I hear
all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.
They say he only sleeps one hour a night. You know about this guy? Tyler
Durden?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fight club – this was mine and Tyler’s gift…
our gift to the world.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: No thanks, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You quit?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Yeah. Where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Work. Going to work.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Nothing. Do what you like.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Okay. Where to begin? With your constant
absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You’re up for
review…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I Am Jack’s Complete Lack of Surprise.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s pretend. You’re the Department of
Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did
nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with
chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a
thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get
out! You’re fired!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What about this? Keep me on payroll as an
outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I’ll keep my mouth shut.
I won’t need to come to the office. I can do this job from home.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: You little fucker! I oughta…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I Am Jack’s Smirking Revenge.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please… don’t hit me again, please. I’m your
responsibility…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For some reason, I thought of my first fight –
with Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please… give me the paychecks like I asked
for. I won’t be any trouble. You won’t see me again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Under and behind and inside everything this
man took for granted, something horrible had been growing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please… please…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And right then, at our most excellent moment
together…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please don’t hit me again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Six months advance pay. Six months!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Fucking sweet.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, and… and…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Forty-eight airline flight coupons. Plus… hold
on… just a minute…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I am now officially self-employed.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I look around… I look around and see a lot of
new faces.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Shut up! Which means a lot of you have been
breaking the first two rules of fight club.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I see in fight club the strongest and
smartest men who have ever lived – an entire generation pumping gas and
waiting tables; or they’re slaves with white collars.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We are the quiet young men who listen until
it’s time to decide.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: Who am I?! There’s a sign on the front that
says “Lou’s Tavern.” I’m fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Tyler Durden.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Who told you motherfuckers you could use my
place?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We have a deal worked out with Irvine.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Irvine? Irvine’s at home with a broken
collarbone.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: He don’t own this place, I do. How much money’s
he getting for this?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: There is no money.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: It’s free to all.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Ain’t that something?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here
now!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re welcome to join our club.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Did you hear what I just said?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You and your friend.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You hear me now?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: No, I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We really need to use this place.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: That’s it…. that’s good. Get it all out.
You’ll feel better.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and this
whole fucking world…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You don’t know where I’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We need this place. We need it. Please let us
keep it, please…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Pleeeeeease!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off
me!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement
light bulbs.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Alright, Christ! Fucking let me go!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Thank you. Thank you, sir…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Let go of me!!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This week, each of you has a homework
assignment. You’re going to go out and start a fight with a total
stranger… You’re going to start a fight… and you’re going to lose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not as easy as it sounds. People’ll do just
about anything to avoid a fight.</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: Hey! Wha… What the hell… what are you
doing?! Who are you?!!</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: Get away from me! Keep away!</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: Who are you!? Why are you attacking me…
?!</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Hey… hey…</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Watch out, jackass!</p>
<p><strong>seminarian</strong>: You… you did that on purpose!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now nobody was the center of fight club except
the two men fighting. The leader walked around in the crowd, out in the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everyone took a homework assignment.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s fight club in Delaware City.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I heard. Local 15, Monday nights.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob
said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Newcastle? Did you start that one?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Let me have that a minute…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Homework assignment.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Human Sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: On a long enough time line, the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Please… don’t…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Give me your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment
A. A small, cramped basement apartment.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: They give basement apartments letters instead
of numbers. Raymond, you’re going to die.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yesssss…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Your mom and dad will have to call kindly
doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won’t be
much left of your face.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Please, God, no…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: An expired community college student ID card.
What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: S-S-Stuff.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: “Stuff.” Were the mid-terms hard?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I asked you what you studied.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tell him!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Biology, mostly.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What did you want to be, Raymond K.
Hessel?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The question, Raymond, was “what did you want
to be?”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Answer him!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: A veterinarian!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Animals.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yeah … animals and s-s-s —</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Stuff. That means you have to get more
schooling.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Too much school.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Would you rather be dead?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No, please, no, God, no!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’m keeping your license. I know where you
live. I’m going to check on you. If you aren’t back in school and on
your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead. Get the
hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I feel sick.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Imagine how he feels.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t care, that was horrible.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of
Raymond K. Hessell’s life.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: His breakfast will taste better than any meal
he has ever eaten.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: in the deserted office, gasoline filled
COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE…BOOM…BOOM…BOOM… !</p>
<p><strong>viewed out 3rd story window</strong>: Tyler uses a RAKE,
dragging it across rocks and dirt. He stops a moment, rake on his
shoulder, staring off. Then, back to work…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: … You are not how much money you have in the
bank. You are not the shoes you wear.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You are not the contents of your wallet…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He had a plan. Maybe you just didn’t see it
till it hit you between the eyes. But, it started to make sense… in a
Tyler sort of way. No fear. No distractions. The ability to let that
which does not matter truly slide.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Go on in. We’re celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You are not your job.</p>
<p><strong>others together</strong>: You are not your job.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You are not how much money you have in the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Shhhh, wait… they’re back to it…</p>
<p><strong>angel face</strong>: Great, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Shhhhh! Watch!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Police Commissioner Jacobs has just
arrived… just a second… excuse me, Commissioner, could you tell us what
you think has happened?</p>
<p><strong>commissioner jacobs</strong>: We believe this is related to
the recent acts of vandalism around the city. It’s some kind of
organized group, and we are coordinating a rigorous investigation.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What did you guys do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The first rule of Project Mayhem is… you do not
ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Wrap it around the top of his hackie-
sack.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Man, his balls are ice cold.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re not going to continue your “rigorous
investigation.” You will publicly state that there is no underground
group. Or – imagine, the rest of your life with your scrotum flapping
empty.</p>
<p><strong>jacobs</strong>: … no… please, no…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We’ll send one to the New York Times and one
to the Los Angeles Times. Press release style. Your nuts will be
bicoastal. Understood? The people you’re after are everyone you depend
on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes
of every Panda that wouldn’t screw to save its species.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I wanted to open the dump valves on oil
tankers and smother all the French beaches I’d never see.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I felt like destroying something
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: There you are, Mr. Durden. Airport parking,
long term.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: After you, Mr. Durden…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: No… after you.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Something on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why wasn’t I told about “Project Mayhem?”</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What should I have told you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why wasn’t I involved from the beginning? You
and I started fight club together.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Fight club was the beginning. Now it’s out of
the basements and there’s a name for it – Project Mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>ricky and mechanic</strong>: The first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is as much mine as yours.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you
and me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What do you want? A statement of purpose…
?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on
your “action item list?”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I want to know –</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What do you want to know about Project
Mayhem?</p>
<p><strong>ricky and mechanic</strong>: The first rule of Project Mayhem
–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up!! I want to know what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This does not belong to us. We are not the
leaders. We are not special.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of
the world. We are all part of the same compost heap…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the hell … ?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You choose your level of involvement. I won’t
make decisions for you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not asking you to.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re asking questions that don’t have
answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t think that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler… what is this… !</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What will you wish you’d done before you
died?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Paint a self-portrait.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Build a house.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know! Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: If you died right now, how would you feel
about your life?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I would feel nothing about my life? Is that
what you want to hear?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I want to hear the truth.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and
fuck Marla. I’m sick of this. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why do you think I blew up your condo?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hitting bottom isn’t a weekend retreat! It’s
not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you
think you know – about life, about friendship, about you and me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, okay… fine…</p>
<p><strong>through thr windshield</strong>: a STALLED CAR ahead on the
side of the road, surrounded by flares.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’d never been in a car accident. This must’ve
been what all those statistics felt like before I filed them into my
reports.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We just had a near-life experience.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: In the world I see – you’re stalking elk
through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life. You
will climb the wrist- thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. You
will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the
empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Feel better, champ.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I’ll be out of your way in a sec.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You… don’t have to… leave.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Really… I mean it. Have you been going to your
groups?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Chloe’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Do you care?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: It was the smart move on her part.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why are we both… caught up like this… with…
?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I came so close to saying Tyler’s name, I
could feel it vibrate inside my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t understand. Why does a weak person
have to go out and find a strong person… to hang onto?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What do you get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Hear what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That… sawing and hammering.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Have we been talking too long? Must we change
the subject?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re not talking about me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: That day you came over to my place to play
doctor… what was going on there?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Nothing? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This conversation…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This conversation…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: … is over.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … is over.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What is this? Who did this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … A person.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Guy or girl?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why would you ask if it’s a guy or a
girl?!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Why would you get bent if I asked?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let go of me… Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You’re afraid to say.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler… ? What’s this for?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Um… what can I do for you, Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re too young. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Too young?”</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: If the applicant is young, we tell him he’s
too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Applicant?”</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: If the applicant waits at the door for three
days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin
training.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Training?” Tyler…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh, look. You’re too… young to… train here.
You should probably be on you way.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you deaf?! I told you to leave! You will
never get inside this house!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Look, friend, I’m sorry for the
misunderstanding. It’s not the end of the world. Just go away. You’re
trespassing and I will call the police. Nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re never getting through this door, you
stupid little weasel! Look at me when I talk to you… !</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is your major malfunction!?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler
wanted us to be.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You have two black shirts? Two pair black
trousers? One pair black boots? Two pair black socks? One black coat?
Three hundred dollars personal burial money? Go inside.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You’re too old. Sorry. And, you’re too fat.
Nice seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob… Bob, wait… Let me explain this to
you…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: A monkey, ready to be shot into space. A
Space Monkey, ready to sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You’re too fucking old, fatty! We don’t want
your kind here! You’re too short. Go away, stumpy! Go back to the
circus!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So it went…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler built his army.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: To what purpose, might one ask? Well, one
might ask, if not for the first rule of Project Mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: In Tyler We Trust.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And, then…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He was gone.</p>
<p><strong>freckled space monkey</strong>: “You are not a beautiful and
unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything
else. We are all part of the same compost heap.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Planet Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>freckled space monkey</strong>: “We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I had to hug the walls, trapped inside this
clockwork of Space Monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in
teams.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The house became a living thing, wet inside
from so many people sweating and breathing. So many people moving, the
house moved.</p>
<p><strong>signs</strong>: “Mischief,” “Disinformation,” “Arson.”</p>
<p><strong>angel face</strong>: That wouldn’t interest you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where’s Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>angel face</strong>: The first rule of Project –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right, right.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m all alone. I Am Jack’s Broken Heart.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>marla’s voice</strong>: Who are all these people?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The Paper Street Soap Company.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s not here! Tyler’s not here anymore! He’s
gone away!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob… oh, Christ…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What… what happened… ?</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: We were on assignment…</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: We were supposed to kill two birds with
one stone:</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: A piece of corporate art…</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: … and trash a trendy coffee bar.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: We had it all worked out, man. It went
smooth… until…</p>
<p><strong>harsh voice</strong>: Police! Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: They shot Bob… they shot him in the head.
Those fuckers…</p>
<p><strong>another space monkey</strong>: We gotta do something.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We got to get rid of the evidence. We have to
get rid of this body.</p>
<p><strong>angel face</strong>: Bury him…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>angel face</strong>: The garden. Take him there. Move,
people. Let’s do this!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… !</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get your hands off him! Get off…! What the
hell do you think you’re doing… ? Evidence?! This is a man… ! You killed
him!</p>
<p><strong>angel face</strong>: He was killed in action.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No! Look at you! You’re… you’re running around
in ski masks, exploding things…</p>
<p><strong>angel face</strong>: He was killed serving Project
Mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s what he would have wanted, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What he wanted? Look… look at him. Look at
him! What does he want? This is a person. This is not a cog in your
machine…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: But, this is Project Mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, no. This is a man – this man has a
name…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No! Wrong! This man’s name is Robert
Paulson.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Robert Paulson?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Robert Paulson is dead. He’s dead, because of
you…</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a
name.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No – !</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: His name is Robert Paulson.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: His name is Robert Paulson!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>all space monkeys</strong>: His name is Robert Paulson!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stop that – !</p>
<p><strong>all space monkeys</strong>: His name is Robert Paulson! His
name is Robert Paulson…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>detective stern’s voice</strong>: This is Detective Stern of
the arson unit. I’d like to see you in my office tomorrow morning…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I went to the cities on Tyler’s used tickets
stubs.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: In every city, I branched out from the airport
to downtown, bar- hopping…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t know how or why, but I could look at
fifty different bars, and somehow I just knew…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here. Let me out, right here…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m looking for Tyler Durden.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is an emergency. It’s important I find
him.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I wish I could help you… sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Every city I went to…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …as soon as I set foot off the plane…</p>
<p>****: …I knew fight club was close.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler was setting up franchises, all over the
country.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I need to know where Tyler is. Can’t you help
me?</p>
<p><strong>bandaged proprietor</strong>: Sir, you’re disturbing the
other patrons with your laudish behavior.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s no one else here.</p>
<p><strong>bandaged proprietor</strong>: I’m sorry, I haven’t the
faintest idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look at my face. I’m a member. I just need to
know if you’ve seen Tyler Durden.</p>
<p><strong>bandaged proprietor</strong>: I’m not disclosed to bespeak
any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information
you want, at this juncture be able.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You are a moron.</p>
<p><strong>bandaged proprietor</strong>: I’m afraid I have to insist you
leave.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Under and behind and inside everything I took
for granted, something horrible had been growing.</p>
<p><strong>bruised patron #1</strong>: No one’s ever seen him. No one
knows what he looks like.</p>
<p><strong>bruised patron #2</strong>: He has facial reconstructive
surgery every three years.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>bruised patron #1</strong>: Is it true about fight club in
Miami?</p>
<p><strong>bruised patron 12</strong>: Is Mr. Durden building an
army?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Am I asleep… ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Have I slept? I’m not sure if Tyler is my bad
dream or if I’m Tyler’s.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was living in a state of perpetual deja
vu.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everywhere I went, I felt I had already been
there.</p>
<p><strong>kitchen workers</strong>: His name is Robert Paulson. His
name is Robert Paulson…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Welcome back, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wounded bartender</strong>: How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … You know me?</p>
<p><strong>wounded bartender</strong>: Is this a test, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes… it’s a test.</p>
<p><strong>wounded bartender</strong>: You were in here last Thursday
night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wounded bartender</strong>: You were standing right where you
are now, asking how good our security is. It’s tight as a drum.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>wounded bartender</strong>: Is this part of the test?</p>
<p><strong>wounded bartender</strong>: You’re the one who did this to
me. You’re Mr. Durden, sir. Tyler Durden.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please return your seatbacks to their full
upright and locked position.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla, it’s me. Have we… have we ever had
sex?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What kind of stupid question is that?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because the answer’s “yes” or because the
answer’s “no?”</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Is this a trick?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You mean, you want to know if I think we were
just having sex or making love?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We did make love?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Is that what you’re calling it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Answer the question!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you
hate me. You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total
asshole! Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship,
Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ve just lost cabin pressure.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What did you say… ?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Say my name.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Say my name! What’s my name!?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking
freak. What’s going on? I’m coming over there…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla, no, wait…</p>
<p><strong>tyler’s voice</strong>: We’ve got six fight clubs in Chicago
now…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Four in Milwaukee.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s this all about, Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: And, we’re definitely filling a void in the
rural South.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why do people think I’m you?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You broke your promise. You talked to her
about me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why do people think I’m Tyler Durden?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Answer me, Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why do people think anything?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know! Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: People think that you’re me, because you and
I happen to share the same body.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Is this really news to you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you talking about… ?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Sometimes I control it, and you imagine
yourself watching me…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The first rule of fight club is – you don’t
talk about fight club.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: And, sometimes you control it…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s not here! Tyler’s not here anymore! He’s
gone away!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You can see me and hear me, but no one else
can…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anyone? My boss, probably. Who would you
fight?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, yeah. I didn’t really know my Dad…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: But, when you fall asleep, I do things
without you…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I go places without you. Get things done…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You are not your job. You are not how much
money you have in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>bruised man #1</strong>: I am not my job!</p>
<p><strong>bruised man #2</strong>: I am not how much money I have in
the bank!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: There! Happy? I asked for one thing from you…
one simple promise. Now look what you’ve done!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This isn’t possible…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We’re going to have to do something about
Marla…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What… what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: It’s okay. We okay… a little codependent,
sure, but…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No! This isn’t true. We… we were around other
people, together, both of us…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You never talked to me in front of anyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wrong, wrong – what about the car crash… the
two guys in the backseat?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What about them? They’re lunatics.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You took me to the house.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The house is rented in your name.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You have jobs.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Night jobs – while you were sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What about Marla?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What about Marla?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’s… you… you’re fucking her.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Um, well… technically, no.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s called a “changeover.” The movie goes on,
and nobody in the audience has any idea.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Sir… sir? Are you checking out?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Please initial this list of phone
calls.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bill me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait…when were these made?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: It says right there, sir… between two
and three-thirty this morning.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I need a copy of this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Had I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later? Has Tyler been in charge longer and
longer?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Deja vu, all over again…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Eighteen-eighty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, something is going to happen,
something terrible…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Very good, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t worry about us, sir. We’re solid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now wait, there’s been a mix-up. Everything’s
changed…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You told me you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Abort the plan.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You told me you’d say that, too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did I tell you I’d call you a fascist
dickhead?!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, sir, you said you might.</p>
<p><strong>different voice</strong>: Twenty-one-sixty. Maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a
fucking broom. I thought they were going to break my arm.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry, I…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: The were burning their fingertips with lye.
The stink was unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla… I need to talk to you. It’s going to
take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – A little more faith than that.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to
say.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me a minute, Marla, alright… just sixty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Sixty seconds, then I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Absolutely, you have every right. I need you
to do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I’ve done you enough favors.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Sir! Anything you order is free of charge,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Why is it free of charge?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because… I’m Tyler Durden.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Then, I’ll have the clam chowder… fried
chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon
pie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Clean food, please.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: In that case, sir, may I advise against the
lady eating the clam chowder?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks, no clam chowder. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You got about thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know that I’ve been… unwell. I know it’s
been like there’s two sides to me.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Two sides? You’re Dr. Jeckle and
Mr. Jackass.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I deserve that. Anyway, I’ve… I’ve only just
realized</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I mean, the depth and breadth of our
relationship has only recently been illuminated for me. I know this… I
know us hasn’t been such a great thing for you…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Whatever. I’ll take my food to go…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sit down! Sit down and give me my last fifteen
seconds without opening your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m trying to tell you – and this is where you
have to trust me – but, I think your life might be in real danger.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as
possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You are an insane person.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marla…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: No, no, shut up! I’ve had enough. I tried,
Tyler… I have tried…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: There’s a part of you I really like, but I
can’t do this anymore. I just can’t. This is killing me…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry, but I…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What?! You’re sorry? I don’t believe that for
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t explain. You wouldn’t believe me
anyway. I’m trying to protect you…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Let go of me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do this for me, Marla. Do this for me, if you
never do anything else…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Leave me alone! I don’t ever want to see you
again!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, if that’s what it takes, you’ll never
have to see me again. Here… here…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Take this money, get on this bus… Get on, and
I promise you, I’ll never bother you again, if that’s what you want.
Please…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Tyler…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m begging you. Get on the bus. Get on the
bus.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t let myself see where you’re going. Go
wherever it takes you, remember… keep away from major cities…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I’m not paying this back. I consider it
“asshole tax.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, fine. Just, get on. Stay away a couple of
weeks, at least.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Tyler…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You are the worst thing that ever happened to
me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I want you to arrest me. I’m the leader of a
terrorist organization responsible for acts of vandalism all over the
city. Detective Stern in arson knows who I am…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There are probably several hundred members in
the metropolitan area. Chapters are sprouting in at least five other
major cities. They’re tightly-regimented, with many cells capable of
operating without a central leader. Check this address: 1537 Paper
Street. You’ll find the body of Robert Paulson buried in the garden.
You’ll also find numerous tubs used to make gallons of nitroglycerin.
The plan, I believe, is to blow up these credit card headquarters and
the TRW building.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Why these buildings?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You are not your job. You are not how much
money you have in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Keep him talking.</p>
<p><strong>flat-top detective</strong>: I really admire what you’re
doing. You’re a brave man to order this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>redhead detective</strong>: You’re a genius, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bald detective</strong>: You know the drill. You said if
anyone ever tries to interfere with Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
get his balls.</p>
<p><strong>flat-top</strong>: It’s useless to fight.</p>
<p><strong>redhead</strong>: This is really a powerful gesture,
Mr. Durden. It’ll set quite an example.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… you’re making a mistake!</p>
<p><strong>flat-top</strong>: You told us you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not Tyler Durden!</p>
<p><strong>baldy</strong>: You told us you’d say that, too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I’m ordering you
to abort the mission!</p>
<p><strong>flat-top</strong>: You said you would definitely say
that.</p>
<p><strong>baldy</strong>: What’s our best time for a “cut and run?”</p>
<p><strong>flat-top</strong>: Four minutes.</p>
<p><strong>baldy</strong>: Is somebody timing this?</p>
<p><strong>redhead</strong>: Wait till the second hand gets to the
twelve.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Some of this info checks out. Let’s go to the
place on Paper Street.</p>
<p><strong>redhead</strong>: Mr. Durden, you’re going to fuck up the
time!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Could be worse…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You could be standing under 37 stories of
steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the
support… oh, maybe it couldn’t be…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You… you can’t be serious about this.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What a ridiculous thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t let you…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: …go through with this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m going to…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: …stop me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not going…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: …to let this happen!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stop finishing…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: …your sentences! They’re</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What are you doing running through the
streets in your underpants? We both use that body.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes
ago. Everything’s proceeding exactly as planned.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You don’t know that. There could still be
people inside.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Maybe. Maybe a couple of guys with shaved
heads couldn’t synchronize their watches. Good riddance.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I wouldn’t be doing that. Unless you know
which wires, in what order…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Or… maybe I knew you’d know, so I spent the
whole day thinking about the wrong ones.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I’m wrong, we’re both dead..</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This is not about martyrdom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m pulling the green wire.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Green? Did you say green?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Don’t pull the green wire. Pull anything but
the green wire.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’m serious. That’s the wrong one.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hear that? Marla’s here. Just in the nick of
time, eh?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: See for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You motherfuckers…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’ve got everything. The bombs. The army.
I’ve got Marla.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in
his head. Was that part of your plan?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle,
there will be casualties. Wouldn’t that be implicit in the name? Project
“Mayhem.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fuck your struggle. I want out.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You want out?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I quit.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Not an option, for the most obvious of
reasons. You need to get with the program. Seven minutes. Let’s get out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tyler…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Defuse the bomb.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Ask me nicely.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Defuse the bomb, please.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Defuse the bomb?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I did that for you. As a gesture. Now, how
fast can you run? There are ten other bombs, in ten other buildings in
the immediate area. If you’re going to get them all, you better get
cracking. Six minutes. Green wires, remember. I’ll be upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Whoa! What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Fire at will.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What did you expect?</p>
<p><strong>on one monitor</strong>: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the
floor, alone, wrestling himself. He swings his left hand up, punching
empty air, then swings his right hand – PUNCHING himself in the side of
the head…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Jack’s head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.
He looks around, trying to focus his eyes…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Jack tries to comprehend. He turns his
head – TYLER’S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK’S MOUTH.
Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: One minute.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think this is about where we came in.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This is the beginning. We’re at ground zero.
Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: i… ann….iinn.. ff….nnyin…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I still can’t think of anything.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: It’s getting exciting now.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Look what we’ve accomplished. Thirty seconds.
Out these windows, we will view the economic collapse. One step closer
to global equilibrium. I’m glad you’re here with me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can’t you call it off… ?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: It’s out of our hands. This is it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10…
9… 8….</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: 5… 4… 3… 2…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What the fuck – ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Paraffin.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with
paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Damn it! God-damn it…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not exactly according to plan.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Do we have to do everything ourselves?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: … Codename Rooster. Passcode First
Strike…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Proceed with remote detonation.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Haven’t we already done this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How’d you do that?! You’re a fucking figment
of my imagination… you’re psychogenic fugue state…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Fuck that, maybe you’re my hallucination.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh… Christ…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why… why… why… ?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why can’t I get rid of you? Why can’t I just
wish you away?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You need me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, no, I don’t. I thank you, I really do.
Thank you, but I don’t need you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I’m not
blind to my own failings…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Noooo, please…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: From now on, we’ll share Marla. We’ve been
spending too much time apart…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … no, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: No more running off without you. From here on
out, we do it together.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why are you doing this?!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’m doing this for us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please understand… I’ve gotten all I can from
this, Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: If I leave, you will be right back where I
found you…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I swear on my life, I won’t…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You will. You know you will.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Can you live with that?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What have you left for me?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why do you want to do that? Why do you want
to put that gun in your mouth?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not my mouth. Our mouth.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s the only way to get rid of you…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I can see you feel very strongly. I feel
strongly too. Hey, you and me. Friends again?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do something for me.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Appreciate something.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look at me…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My eyes are open.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What’s that smell… ?</p>
<p><strong>tall space monkey</strong>: Are you all right, sir… ?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m okay…</p>
<p><strong>short space monkey</strong>: Are you sure? You look terrible,
sir! What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>another space monkey</strong>: Sir, you look really awful! Do
you need medical assistance?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bring the girl to me. The rest of you get out.
Now!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What happened… ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get to the rendezvous point. Move it!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: My God, you’re shot…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Who did this to you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I did, I think. But, I’m okay… I’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry… you met me at a very strange time
in my life.</p>
