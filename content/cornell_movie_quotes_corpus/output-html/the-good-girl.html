<p><strong>justine</strong>: As a girl, you see the world like a giant
candy store, filled with sweet candy and such. But one day you look
around and see a prison and you’re on death row. You wanna run, or
scream or cry. But something’s locking you up. Are the other folks cows,
chewing cud till the hour come and their heads roll? Or are they just
keeping quiet, like you… Planning their escape?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: On your left, honey.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What’s that cashier’s name?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: When did he start working here?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Don’t know. Yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Don’t know. Can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It’s called work, princess. Kind of fun. You
might want to give it a go someday.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Attention, shoppers. There’s a Retail Rodeo
special on aisle three. Liquid drain cleaner. Two 12-ounce cans for $5.
Liquid drain cleaner has churning power and will churn right through
your pipes. Ladies, shove something clean and new up your filthy pipes.
Liquid drain cleaner on aisle three. Have a good day and thank you for
shopping at Retail Rodeo.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Hey, Justine. Can I talk to you for a
second?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: I was just curious. Have you ever been to a
Bible study?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: We got a good one going on every Wednesday at
the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney comes, Benita comes. You got any
interest in reading the Bible?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I have my own, you know, beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: We don’t preach fire and brimstone. Just the
Ten Commandments. We�re not interested in scaring people. We�re about
loving Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I kinda like my nights to myself.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Well, maybe you’ll have nights of eternal
hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you. Drive safe.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Hey, Justine.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, Teeny. How was your day?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: The same. How was yours?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: The wind was flipping paint in our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Paint stings. Feel like I’ve been attacked by
hornets in my eyeballs.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Bubba, stand up.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: For Christ’s sakes. Look at that couch,
Phil. Y’all got paint all over it. This ain’t gonna come off. Damn it,
Phil.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: …including this gorgeous eggplant…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think we got most of it out.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You two were stoned. You, keep frying your
brain liike that, you’ll slip off a ladder and crack open your head
bone. You do really stupid things when you’re high, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Like sitting on my couch with your big blue
ass. Everything just turns to shit. You finally get nice things, then
everything just gets messed up. Why is this TV buzzing?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s the wind doing that. They the wind’s
coming in different lately.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Different from what?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What you reading?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Catcher in the Rye� I’m named after it.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What’s your name? Catcher?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Holden. After Holden Caulfield. He’s the
main character.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What’s he do?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: He’s put upon by society. Hypocrisy of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I notice that you’re, uh, not very
social.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I’m a writer.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What do you write?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Novels, plays, screenplays, stories,
poetry.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: That’s good. Justine will be right with you.
Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I better go. What happens at the end of
your book?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Oh, he has a nervous breakdown. Goes to a
mental hospital.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You don’t get paid to pick your crack. You get
paid to work.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m not sure I can do makeovers.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh, come on! A little pancake, eyeliner,
mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder it up. Then you take a moist
tissue, roll it in a ball and toss it in their face! Jeez, Louise… I’m
talking to a tree stump! Girl, where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Sorry, I�m just a little tired.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It’s the food you eat, Justine. Look at me. I
am 10 years older than you and have 10 times your energy. Cause I don’t
eat meat and I don’t eat dairy. It’s probably why you can’t get
pregnant, honey. And why you have that hung-jaw look on your face. It’s
the cheese in your pizza and the chicken in your salad.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I went to the doctor. He says I’m fertile.
He says I could repopulate the entire planet.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Then what’s the deal here? Did he say you get
enough vitamins?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: He didn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You could make paint where, at different
angles, the house is different colours. You stand at the front door and
the house is red. You stand at the street and the house is green. Or you
could make, like, an invisible paint. Make the whole house
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: What would be really neat is a paint that
could change the molecular structure of a house, like a chemical acid
deal.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What do you think, Teeny?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I think you two are a pair of potheads.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: You getting a whole one of these or a
half?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: That oneright there.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: You didn’t bring this into the store?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Well then, I’ll charge you for it. This is a
hand lotion. So don’t put it anywhere else, even if you need
lubrication. We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to a minimum, unless,
ofcourse, the customer is at fault. Here’s your change and Fuck you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Good as new, I’ll tell ya, good as new.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Now, you might be interested in purchasing
some of the products I used today…</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Oh, I’m not buying anything today.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Well, that’d be a mistake. These are bargain
prices.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: I didn’t bring my purse.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I hate my job.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: That makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I hate everyone here. I hate Gwen. I don’t
know what the hell she’s so happy about. I’m sorry I don’t understand
why maniacs get shotguns and shoot everybody to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Maybe you’re a maniac.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Maybe so. You know you’re lips are real
pouty, like a woman. And how your eyes droop off to the side. How old
are you?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Twenty two.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m an old lady next to you.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: How old do you think?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I am thirty years old.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: How long you been workin’ here for?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Forever and a day!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You don’t have a car?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Oh, I live right down the street.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well, you can ride in here, there’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You wanna come in?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t know. I’m in a funk.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Well, I’m not gonna beg ya.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I’ll be in my room.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Okay, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: They call you Tom?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: It’s my slave name. Holden’s what I call
myself. This is my room.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Not aolt to look at. What are your folks
like?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: They’re okay. They don’t get me. I mean,
they’re alright.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: My husband doesn’t get me.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Since when do you have a husband?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Since seven years. He’s a painter.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: What’s he paint?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Houses. He’s a pig. He talks but he doesn’t
think. You go to college?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Um, I had to drop out. I had a problem with
drinkin’ and stuff. I’ll go back. I just gotta prove to my parents that
I can fly staright. You go to college?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No, I was afraid I’d lose Phil if I went.
Now that’d be reason enough to go. I saw you in the store and I liked
how you kept to yourself. I can see in your eyes that you hate the
world. I hate it too. You know what I’m talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: After livin in the dark for so long a
glimspe of the light can make you giddy. Strange thought come into your
head and you’d better think ‘em. Has a special fate been callin’ you and
you not listenin? Is there a secret message right in front you, and
you’re not reading it? Is this your last, best chance? Are you gonna
take it? Or are you goin’ to the grave with unlived lives in your
vains?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Teeny, you’re pretty. Bubba, isn’t Teeny
pretty?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I’ve seen better, I’ve seen worse. Nah.
That’s why I ain’t never married. You got yourself the best fish in the
sea.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I wonder what it’d be like to be a woman. All
that smooth skin and long hair.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: If I was a woman, I’d be a slut. A lesbian
slut.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Gwen says smokin’ marijuana lowers your
sperm.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Lowers it to where?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Maybe you’re the infertile one ‘round here.
Maybe every time you smoke a little dooby, you’re killin’ our unborn
children.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Alright, close.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Why you limping.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I twisted up my ankle on the stairs. I was
wonderin’, maybe you could give me a ride home?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah, sure okay.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Alright I’ll talk to you about it later.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: All I know is, everyone should have one beau,
before anyone has two beaus.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: He’s not my beau, he’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers!
There’s a Retail Rodeo special on all bulk candy on aisle four. Ghouls
and goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering these aisles, day after
day. I’ll put a Halloween curse on you.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Night Corny. Happy Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Well I’m not a pagen but thanks all the
same.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Which ankle did you twist, Holden?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: My, uh, left.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Maybe you should put some cold water on it so
it doesn’t sweel up and inflame.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You’re a writer so you have yourself a
goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine other cities, other jobs I could
have. Other husbands. Now I don’t even know what to imagine anymore.
Holden, I have a husband.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You said he was a pig.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well, Holden. I don’t want to hurt
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I was thinking about what you were sayin’
about my sperm bein’ low. I mean, I know I got good sperm. It’s
baby-makin sperm. I suppose it couldn’t hurt to have it confirmed by an
expert.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh who gives a shit, who needs a F&amp;$%’
baby around here anyways? If you wanna make yourself useful, why don’t
you get that goddamn TV fixed?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It sounds like a helicopter is landin’ in
here.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You want a blackberry, honey? A man was
sellin’ ’em on the road.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: This is for you Justine. It’s from
Holden.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well where is he?</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: He’s got the day off. He came by this morning
with it.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Don’t mention it. Hey, Gwen.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Hey sugar.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Dear Justine. Because of you I’ll be
quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last two days have been the most
god-awful days of my life. I’ve not been able to get rid of you in my
head. I never wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted many things. I’d
given up long ago on being gotten by someone else, and then you came
along. The idea of being gotten, because of circumstance, will never get
got is the worst feeling I’ve ever felt, and I have felt many bad
feelings. I’m sorry I can never see you again, Justine, forgive me for
being so weak, but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden Wurther. If for
some reason, you could change your mind and want to be with me, body and
soul, meet me after work. I will be waiting for you at five PM outside
Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not there at five, you will never see me in
your lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Gwen? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Gwen? Gwen you sick?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Justine? Justine what’s goin’ on in here?
Gwen, you sick? We gotta get her to a hospital. Justine you drive
her.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s aquarter to five. Why, you gotta be
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Gwen?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh, I had a dream. I had dream that I sprouted
a beard made of bean sprouts.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m gonna let you off here, okay?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Okay,You’ll meet me inside?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah, you know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna
park the car, then I’m gonna meet you inside.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Okay. Your a doll.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Hey. Oh god, I’m really glad you came.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I just ditched Gwen at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Oh god, thank god.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Where are we goin’?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Let’s go to my house.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No, with your folks there?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Let’s just park somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: This isn’t well planned.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Look. I don’t know. I don’t care I just
wanna hold you.</p>
<p><strong>hotel guy</strong>: That’s fourty five dollars even. And I
need you to fill this out for me.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: We’ll be back here before you know it.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t wanna… I don’t wanna go.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Justine. I’m yours. I’m all yours.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jutsine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Were you been?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin’
up all over the store. I had to take her to the hositpal, and sat with
her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did she sick up on you?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did she sick up on anybody?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s not funny, Phil, this is serious. I’m
gonna go up there tomorrow too. And the next day.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Justine? What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I went down to St. Catherine’s to check up on
Gwen. I looked all over for you, she was askin’ for you.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well, how is she?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She was heavin’ up until there was nothin’
left to heave. Doctor said she must’ve eaten somethin’ with some kind of
parasite in it or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I bet it was those blackberries.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re gonna keep her in there until she gets
better so you’re gonna have to supervise cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Stop it, somebody’s gonna see!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Who cares, I don’t care. I crave you. I
wanna know everything about you. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m just this woman. I moved to Texas when
I was eleven. My daddy was in the Air Force.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I wanna knock open your head and see what’s
inside. I’ve had so much pain in my life. I know you have too, I can see
it.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Holden gave me two of his stories to read.
It’s like what a story would be. I was about a boy who was put upon, his
mother was cold and selfish, and his father wanted him to play football.
Other people didn’t get him, especially girls. Then the boy comes to
believe no one can ever really know him. So he starts actin’ out,
drinkin’, and doin’ all kinds of drugs. At the end the boy kills himself
but jumpin’ over abridge. The second story was pretty much the same as
the first. Except at the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin’ a bottle
of bug poison.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Your stories are intense.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I just wanna leave some kind of legacy.
Somethin’ great. After that I don’t care what happens to me.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Don’t say that. I wish there was a story
about me. I don’t know who would read it though.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I would.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I like this. I like havin’ a secret. You
gave me a secret Holden.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Seee, now that you met me you’re mysterious.
And dark and twisted.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m going to hell, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: That’s Bubba’s truck. Get in the car. Phil
takes that truck to work everyday. Bubba picks him up, and drops him
off. Why, why would that truck be parked there?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: If he finds out about us….</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I won’t let him hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: He’s big, Holden. He’ll kill you. He’ll
beat me, but he’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You can’t worry about somethin’ that hasn’t
even happened yet.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I gotta go to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Don’t! I mean he could be followin’ us.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Justine! Poor lady. She just passed.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Gwen! She just passed away.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What do you mean? I thought she had a
stomach ache?</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: It got worse. She was on life support all
day.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: It’s God’s will, Justine. No one can
understand it. It was just Gwen’s time to fly away home.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Gwen died today.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What? Are you kiddin? What for?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Parasite. Somethin’ she ate.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Where were you this afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Paintin’ on Bovery. Why?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What time did Bubba bring you home?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We knocked off early ’bout four. Bubba had a
date with a stewardess, why?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh. I can’t believe she’s dead. I wasn’t a
very good friend to her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t say that, Teeny. ’Course you were.
’Course you were.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack Fields,
your store manager. Before we open today, I just want to share some
terrible and shocking news. One of our best employees, Gwen Jackson,
died yesterday. Gwen was a real class act. She had a good attitude, she
had ideas. We’re all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y’all need to
collect you thoughts and remember Gwen. GWEN, then today’s the day.
You’ll be excused from work and we’ll just have to do without you. Gwen,
this one’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Holden had the notion to go to Gabler’s
Creek, skinny dippin’ and makin’ love. He said we’d be like Adam and
Eve, rollin’ around around in the sticks and the dirt and bein’ one with
nature. He was so fixed on the idea thateven when the clouds started
rollin’ in, and the sky was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin’. All my
thoughts turned to death. I thought of Gwen’s body, rottin’ away. I
thought of how nice a person she was, so full of life and good will. If
there was a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin’ makeovers and offerin’
up helpful advice. I thought if I died today, what would happen to me? A
hateful girl. A selfish girl. An adultress. A liar.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What are we doin’?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Makin’ one out of two.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I haven’t thought this through.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Justine, will you leave him?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: And go where?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Away. With you on my arm, my folks’ll think
I’ve changed. They’ll stop thinkin’ I’m suck a loner, I got a
girlfriend, a pretty one, who knows me and likes me. And they’ll be so
happy, they’ll give me money to write my novel.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: But where will we GO?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: We’ll be like… Catcher in the Rye. Only by
me. I’ll be immortal and then like JD Salinger I’ll just vanish.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, Teeny. We’ve been up to no good. We got
the day off on account of the rain.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I thought you might.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: So I heard about your friend bein’ dead, and
all. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah. She was real healthy too.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Well, at least you were with her when she
went. Ain’t that right? You were… with her, when she went?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, I wish it would rain every day from here
on out. Never have to paint again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey Justine. How you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Real shocker. I decided to move Cheryl over to
cosmetics. She got a little too creative on the P.A. Maybe she’ll watch
her P’s and Q’s over here. If not she’s out on her but. Now you listen
to Justine, sister.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You want me to help you get stuff out of
storage?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Not right now, maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Well, are you gonna give me a ride home? My
ankle’s actin’ up.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I gotta get home. Maybe Cheryl can.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: What, you need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I think we gotta take a breather. I’m
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Well, can’t we go to the motel?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Well, let’s go in the store room.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Just be patient, Holden!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I was wonderin’, when was that, uh, bible
study?</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Tomorrow night at eight. We’d love to have
ya.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Can I bring my husband?</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: ’Course! A couple that prays together stays
together.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: The Holy Bible. There’s one for you, and
one for me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not very light is it?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: We’re goin’ to Bible study. A couple that
prays together, stays together.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I heard it was the couple that lays together
stays together.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well you heard wrong.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Cheryl? You think you can take this
one?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Sure… Sit right down here ma’am, we’re gonna
make you pretty. Now how do you like your hair?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Wait, you gonna do my hair?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: No, I just need to know if that’s your usual
way of wearing it all big and high. If it is then I’ll just put more
makeup on your chin to off-set. Now, you’re gonna want to take a whole
bottle of this home wtih you. It’s got quite alot of ingredients in it
so you’re getting a good deal. It’s got Ginco extract in it, do you know
what that is?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: It’s extract of the Ginco and it makes your
skin real slick so that any liquid will roll right off, be it water or
lemon juice or urine. I’ll put that in a bag for you.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Phil, what the hell are you doin’? We’re
gonna be late for Bible study. You’re stoned, you got paint in your
hair, would you just get in the shower?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I completely didn’t remember…</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Get in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Workin’ on your spiritual life?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Ain’t that a hoot and a holler.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I saw you, Justine.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Saw me what?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I saw you. We got some things to talk about,
you and me. You come by my place after work. If you knwo what’s good for
ya.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey. Where’s Bubba?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: He left.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I’m ready. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know what to say about Jesus. I’m
stoned.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Just let the other people do the
talking.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well, that’s alright, they’ll forgive
us.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad you could
make it!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Y’all are in for a treat. We got a good
discussion going tonight. If man is made in God’s image, what does that
say about God?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, that sounds like a good one.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Phil, come with me to the car.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Come with me to the car, I gotta get
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Just get in the car. Get in the car,
Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t want to go to Bible study.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Because I don’t want to. Now, can we please
just get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Justine, this is embarassing. We’re runnin’
away from Bible study like a couple of Devil worshippers.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t care. I’m not in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You are freakin’ me out, man. Why?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is
why.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You just said a few minutes ago they’ll
forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So can
we please just get the shit outta here?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m never goin’ back to Bible study again.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t care, fine by me.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: I think I look too white, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: I’m just tryin’ to match your face with your
hair, I was thinkin’ you’re not white enough.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: I think I look kinda wierd.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Well, the first rule of fashion is that you
have to look wierd. What I’m doing here has come straight from
France.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: It’s called circ du face, meaning circus of
the face and it’s all the rage with the Frenchies.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Well, you’re the professoinal.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Justine, what happened to you? I looked up
and I saw you two drivin’ off like vampires in the night.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: You coulda looked off your neighbor. It’s a
church, you know. You can’t make water without bumpin’ your nut on a
bible.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh. Well, we felt bad.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: What in blazes?!</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I can’t go.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I can’t go today. There’s something
important I need to tend to.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I thought you said we’d go today.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well, something came up.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: What came up?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody’s found
out about us.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I’m starting to wonder if you even want to
go. I’m startin’ to think you don’t get me.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well, maybe I don’t get you.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You do, you do get me you just don’t want to
me ‘cause I’m too intensified for you! Justine, who cares, who cares if
someone finds out. We don’t have to live like this, Justine. I know what
it’s like to go home every night and feel like you’re hidin’ out. We can
leave all this behind…</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: That’s easy for you to say, Holden, you are
not married.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You just, you just gonna give up?! You gonna
go crawlin’ back?!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Holden, you are gonna get us caught!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You’re so fucking afraid it makes me sick.
Don’t give up on us.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Okay. Good luck on your important thing.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner!
Back in your corner! Back in your corner, Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show
you somethin’. Sit. I’m in shock.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: You know why.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Bubba sat like that for what seemed like
ten years before he began to speak. Finally, when he opened his mouth,
he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life. He talked
about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me. And how he always wanted a
girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary
girl like me, that he never found. Then he wen on about givin’ up your
dreams and how it’s all a part of gettin’ older. Bubba had given up on
his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and
forever. Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open.
Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work.
The sounds of me makin’ love to a man that wasn’t Phil was like a shout
in Bubba’s ear from the creator himself. What it meant, or what to do,
or why Bubba didn’t know. All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning
the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long. I was no longer
Bubba’s image of perfection. To him I was just a liar, and a whore, and
that sickened him. But on the other hand he loved me for opening his
eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to
Phil. Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was
beautiful. Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do.
Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic
cycle.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: But don’t you see? This is my chance, for
liberation.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: But, one person’s liberation is another
person’s, well, badness. There’s just no way.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I’m gonna have to tell Phil then.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: He’s my best friend. I can’t keep him in the
dark about somethin’ this big. He’s a cuckhold.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You wanna cuckhold him yourself!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Well that’s different. That isn’t about him.
That’s about my salvation. Look, you’ve got your choice to make. Either
destroy your marriage, and break your husband’s heart. Or have sex with
me right now.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh god! There was someone in the window!
Did you not see?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: You’re paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Phil is never gonna find out about any of
this. Don’t fret.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Get this damn dog away from me!</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: You’re lookin’ at a free man, Justine. A free
man.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Great. Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m nervous.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You’re nervous? Why?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: ’Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow and
jism into a cup, that’s why. What if I can’t do it?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know, If you said you’d help me I’d feel
alot less nervous. It’s gonna be on your lunch hour anyway.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You didn’t even say nothing about the TV bein’
fixed.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh. Is it? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well aren’t you a fright? Justine, you talked
to Holden lately? He didn’t show up for work today, I wanna know what
gives. I know you two are friends.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: We’re not friends.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You eat lunch together every day.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No, we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, if you see him, tell him Jack Fields is
lookin’ for him.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh my god. What are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You’re a hooker, you hooker.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I saw you. You followed me.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: So, how many guys you gettin’ with? You
gettin’ with every guy in the state?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No, Holden, this is all because of you. He
had me over a barrel. If I didn’t sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil
about us!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I’m so alone!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You’ve gotta get a hold of yourself! Are
you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Yes, I’m drunk! And I’ll be drunk every day
until the day I die! What do you care?! You jump on any pecker that’s
put in front of you!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me after
work.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I gotta help Phil with his sperm.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Just go. Go!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I can’t share you, Justine! Maybe with one
man but not with a whole bunch of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mr. Last? Would you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Good luck, honey.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Knock ’em dead, partner. Bubba watch Phil
walk into one of the You look nice.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I know you’re angry and I can figure why.
But, from where I stand, what happened yesterday was a wonderful
thing.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Nothin’ happened yesterday, so drop it.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Well, I’m awful grateful to ya, Justine.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Bubba, I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Let me just ask you one thing. How do I stack
up against Phil? You know, how do I stack up where it counts?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Ma’am? Your husband asked me to request for
your presence.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s Justine.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: C’mon. I can’t do this on my own. I need
help.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You’ve never done it on your own?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not in a place like this! Not where I have to
hand over the results! Just, let me hold your boob.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Ah, they’re sore.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: What’s wrong with you? You look like
death.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: My stomach’s crampin’. I feel sore.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Is it your period?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Nah, it’s stress.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: This job is stressful. I’m breaking out.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You’re breakin’ out ’cause you put so much
makeup on your face.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Maybe you’re pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What?… No…</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You know, sometimes, I think to myself, at
least it can’t get any worse. But it can. I can worse. As long as you
can say you’ve hit rock bottom you can.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh my god, Blackberries.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: A blind man can go deaf. A widow can lose
her children. Babies starve and they never get food. They never get any
food. They just come into the world and they die.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Calm down, Holden!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I can’t calm down! I’d be easy if I was a
hooker like you. I could calm down all over town.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I know you’re not. I’m in agony.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: What do you mean ‘why’? I thought you hated
your life.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I do. I mean I’m depressed but… You are
really depressed.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I’ll kill him. I’ll murder him in his sleep.
I’ll kill my parents, I’ll steal the money whatever it takes. You just,
just whatever you want as long as it’s you and me. Please don’t forsake
me Justine.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh… I, I promise. Justine and Holden are
sitting on the</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I realized then that Holden was at best a
child, and at worst a demon. If I was ever gonna go straight I’d have to
ditch him. Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to
make a few pit stops.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: How much are the blackberries?</p>
<p><strong>blackberry man</strong>: A tin for two dollars, miss. There
you go.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Have a blackberry.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: We need a plan. We can’t keep livin’ day to
day. We gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick….</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Have a blackberry, Holden!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: But, they’re dirty. They’re sweet. If I
could only get my hands on some money, someone could just tell me the
answer. I gotta do. But If I ever do, I end up thinking about it
instead. I gotta do. But do what? pushes the blackberry he’s about to
What…? What was that for?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: They looked dirty. I, I think I saw a bug
in them or something.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m worried about Holden. Tom. I’m worried
about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, and now, well, I think he’s
mentally ill. He has this idea in his head that we’ve had some sort of
affair. Which is crazy because I’m, I’m married. He’s been sayin’ all
sorts of strange things, and makin’ threats. And drinkin’. And, and I
just think he would be better off in a place where people,
professionals, could take care of him. Otherwise, he’s just gonna get
himself in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What are you doin’ in here? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s a home pregnancy test.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why you takin’ it?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: ’Cause I still haven’t gotten my
period.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Well, I haven’t taken it yet. Could you
give me a minute please?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I wanna be here when you find out.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The little plastic doohickey’s turnin’ blue.
What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Blue?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Bright blue.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It means I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I knew it. Waste of time going to that sperm
doctor. We did it. We’re gonna have ourselves a baby.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And tomorrow, we’re gonna celebrate at Senor
Tuna. Yes we are. I’m gonna bring Bubba. You can bring some of your
friends from work. Or Bible study guy. Whoever. Too bad Gwen’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: The test could be wrong, Phil. It’s a
little early to be havin’ a party.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Let’s do it mellow then. You sure don’t seem
too excited.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No, I’m excited. It’s just, a lot of
worries come with havin’ a baby…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t think negative. Think positive. We could
have ourselves a tiny Phil. Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny’s gonna have a tiny
weeny Teeny.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Do you think anything’s gonna change havin’
a baby?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What do you mean? Everything’s gonna
change.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything’s
really gonna change?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What do ya mean?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hi, this is Dr. Williams returning the call
of Jean Worther. I’m calling from the Holland County psychiatric
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Who was it, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: It was a wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Either of you seen Holden? Boy is out on his
ass!</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Justine, somethin’s goin’ on. Something is
definately happening.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Go find out.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: It’s big. It’s very big.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: C’mon Cheryl, I’m gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars from
the safe. They blew the thing open with a gun.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Not only that but the cops know who did

<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: Justine, you like workin’ at the Retail Rodeo
don’t you? Like the company, like the people? You wouldn’t want to
jeopardize that by makin’ some silly error in judgement would ya?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars from the
safe last night. Did you have anything to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No. I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: ’Cause we know you’re pretty tight with
Holden.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I hardly know him.</p>
<p><strong>corny</strong>: I’ve seen you in the store room with him
Justine. On many the occasion. I think you know him pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Justine! Justine!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I did it! I finally did somethin’!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Holden, the police are lookin’ for you!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Oh, who cares? I’m proud of myself. Fuck
them, Fuck all of them!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Hey! They think that I’m in on it, too!
Corny’s got a camera in that storage room. That Bible thumpin’ pervert’s
been watchin’ us the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Well, we’re outta here! Justine, I got over
twenty thousand dollars! I got a gun, what else?!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m gettin’ all goosey. I think I’m gonna
crash. I’m pregnant, Holden.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: It’s my baby.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Yes, it is. You know it is.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby on
the run.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Yes, you can. I mean, you can’t raise a baby
here. You know that. Justine. You hate your husband. You hate your job.
You love me, so let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I can’t go tonight. I gotta pack my things
and I’d have to get more money.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Well, then tomorrow. I’ll go to the motel
and wait for you. Just be there by noon.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: This is all going too fast.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Justine, what have you got to lose?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: So be there by noon.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: I love you, Justine. This is all gonna work
out. I know it. I almost forgot. This is a story of your life. You
inspired me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey Teeny!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We were gettin’ worried about ya!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this is
Justine.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>liberta</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Congratulations, on your expectation.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>liberta</strong>: Do you think it’s a girl or a boy?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Doesn’t matter. As long as it plays
quarterback for the Cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Well, I hear Senor Tuna callin’.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello. Yeah. Well, that’s not right. What’s
that supposed to mean? Hey look. No. You don’t know shit okay. Justine’s
pregnant. You got that? Well, look you better check your records again,
pal, then call me! Some doctor says my sperm’s no good. Does that mean
Justine’s not pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: No. That just means they got it wrong, is
all. They don’t know everything.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: They just got it wrong, so…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Looks like that wind’s pickin’ up again.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: How it all came down to this, only the
devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the corner on my left, the motel was
down the road to my right. I closed my eyes and tried to peer into the
future. On my left I saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks.
Dirty looks and quiet whisperings. and burning secrets that won’t ever
die away. And on my right, what could I picture? The blue sky, the
desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, never
ending nothing.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Hey Justine.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I know where you can find him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Holden?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: He’s at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he’ll be
there till noon.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You done good. You’re a good girl.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s going on in the bedroom? Looks like a
twister hit it.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh yeah. I was doin’ laundry.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I thought we were robbed. Why aren’t you at
work?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: They gave me the day off.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck
Fields, your store manager. As most of you all know by now, We lost
another employee yesterday. Holden was a thief and a disturbed young
man, and what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps we can learn a lesson
from this tragedy, like don’t steal and don’t be disturbed. The
important is to move on. Like dozens of those who quit. This one’s for
you Holden.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: I thought we were gonna get a day off and go
to the movies….</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I was just at your house and the mail came.
Phil was opening letters, and he opened this bill from the credit card
company. And F&amp;$%. Please don’t tell him about us, Justine. Please.
Please. I love Phil. I love him more than myself. Please have mercy on
me.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Hey Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Have you been sleepin’ around behind my
back?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I said, have you been sleepin’ around behind
my back?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t you love me? Don’t you love me at
all?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You’re the only man alive that I love.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh god. Please don’t tell me it’s not my
baby.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s your baby.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It is. I swear. I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, it does. Was it some guy from work?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, I know who it was. It was that Bible
guy, wasn’t it? The Nazarine. That’s why you were actin’ so spooked.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m gonna beat his ass.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re gettin’ all swollen. I’m sorry I hit
you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’m sorry, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I need to get stoned.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Okay. Get stoned.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I just gotta escape, you know. You ever feel
like that? Like you gotta escape?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: What are those?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Fake eyelashes. Extra long.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Just do it normal for once?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: You want me to make the other cheek purple
to even it out?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: D’you hear about Corny? He was goin’ home
after Bible study last night and two beefy guys with painted faces
pulled up in a truck and jumped him.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: That’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: That day I read the story Holden wrote for
me. It was kinda different from the other one, but kinda the same. It
was about a woman who was put upon. Whose job was a prison, and whose
life had lost all meaning. Other people don’t get her, especially her
husband. One day she meets a boy who is also put upon, and they fall in
love. After spending their whole lives not getting got, with one look
they get eachother completely. In the end, the boy and the girl run away
together in the wilderness, never to be heard from again.</p>
