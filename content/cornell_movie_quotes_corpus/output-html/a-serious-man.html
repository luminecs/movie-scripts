<h1 id="a-serious-man">a-serious-man</h1>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What a marvel… what a marvel…</p>
<p><strong>house interior</strong>: As its door opens and the man
enters.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Dora!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You can’t imagine what just happened. I was
coming back on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart thank
heavens it was the way back and I’d already sold the geese!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fifteen groshen, but that’s not the story. I
was struggling to set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from
the direction of Lvov. How lucky, you think, that someone is out this
late.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yes, very remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But that’s the least of it! He stops to help
me; we talk of this, we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you
know! Traitle Groshkover!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: God has cursed us.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three
years.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Why do you say such a thing! I saw the man! I
talked to him!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: You talked to a dybbuk. Traitle Groshkover
died of typhus in Pesel Bunim’s house. Pesel told me-she sat shiva for
him.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: For some soup, to warm himself. The wind moans.
He helped me, Dora!</p>
<p><strong>the door</strong>: We are looking in from the outside as it
unlatches and creaks in, opened by the husband in the foreground, who
has arranged his face into a strained look of greeting. In the
background the wife stares, hollow-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: REB GROSHKOVER! You are welcome here! Reverse
on REB GROSHKOVER: a short, merry-looking fellow with a bifurcated beard
and a silk hat and spectacles. He gives a little squeal of delight.</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: You are too kind, Velvel! Too
kind!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes! A ray of sun, a ray of sun! Sit!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: My husband said he offered you soup.</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: Yes, but I couldn’t possibly eat
this late, or I’d have nightmares. No, no: no soup for me!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: I see! You think I’m fat enough
already!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: No. A dybbuk doesn’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: What a wife you have!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I assure you, REB GROSHKOVER, it’s nothing
personal; she heard a story you had died, three years ago, at Pesel
Bunim’s house. This is why she think you are a dybbuk; I, of course, do
not believe in such things. I am a rational man.</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: Oh my. Oh my yes. What nonsense. And
even if there were spirits, certainly… He thumps his chest. I am not one
of them!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Pesel always worried. Your corpse was left
unattended for many minutes when Pesel’s father broke shiva and left the
room-it must have been then that the Evil One- She breaks off to spit at
the mention of the Evil One. -took you!</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: “My corpse!” Honestly! What a wife
you have!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Oh yes? Look, husband…</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: I shaved hastily this morning and
missed a bit-by you this makes me a dybbuk?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Woman, what have you done?</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: Why would she do such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: What do you say now about spirits? He is
unharmed!</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: On the contrary! I don’t feel at all
well.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Dora! Woe, woe! How can such a thing be!</p>
<p><strong>reb groshkover</strong>: Perhaps I will have some soup. I am
feeling weak…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Dear wife. We are ruined. Tomorrow they will
discover the body. All is lost.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Nonsense, Velvel… She walks to the door…
Blessed is the Lord. Good riddance to evil and shuts it against the
wind.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: A drumbeat thumps in the black. Music blares:
the Jefferson Airplane. Grace Slick’s voice enters: When the truth is
found to be lies And all the hope inside you dies Don’t you want
somebody to love. . .</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Mee yodayah? Reuven? Rifkah? Mah zeh
“anakim”? Efsheh mashooach ba-avodah?</p>
<p><strong>a blinding light</strong>: At the cut to the light the
Jefferson Airplane music jumps up full. The light resolves into a
multi-flared image of a blinking eye. Reverse: the inside of a human
ear. Fleshy whorls finely veined, a cavity receding to dark. Objective
on the DOCTOR’s office: the DOCTOR is peering through a lightscope into
the ear of an early-middle-aged man, LARRY Gopnik. The Jefferson
Airplane music continues.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school</strong>: Close on Hebrew characters being
scribbled onto the blackboard as the TEACHER talks. The TEACHER,
talking. A bored child, staring off. His point-of-view: a blacktopped
parking lot with a few orange school busses, beyond it a marshy field,
and distant suburban bungalows. Close on another child staring at
something through drooping eyelids. His point-of-view: very close on the
face of a classroom clock. We hear its electrical hum. Its red
sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very slowly. DANNY Gopnik
hisses:</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fagle!.. . The TEACHER drones on, writing on
the blackboard. DANNY’s eyes flit from the TEACHER to the student
sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky youth with shaggy hair. He
hasn’t heard the prompt. . Fagle! The TEACHER turns from the blackboard
and DANNY leans back, eyes front, folding the twenty up small behind his
book.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai. Mee
yodayah? Misaviv tamid anachnoo tamid… The clock-watching child, eyelids
sinking, is beginning to drool out of one side of his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school</strong>: A bored child is excavating a bugger
from his nose. The TEACHER turns back to the chalkboard to circle
something.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fagle!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Hamrah oomoh- He interrupts himself briefly
to make a couple of phlegm-hawking sounds. He resumes: . Hamrah oomoh
meshiach oomshel zal?</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s office</strong>: The DOCTOR palpates LARRY’s
midriff, digging his fingers into the hairy, baggy flesh. DOCTOR’s Voice
Uh-huh. We’ll do some routine X-rays.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school</strong>: A young girl holds a hank of her
bangs in front of her face, separating out individual hairs to examine
them for split ends.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Ahnoo ahnoo mah? Mah? Talmidim?
D’vorah?</p>
<p><strong>d’vorah</strong>: Ahnee to yodayah. The TEACHER begins to
pace the desk aisles, looking back and forth among the students.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Mee yodayah? The bugger-seeker, having
succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully drapes it over the sharp end
of his pencil, to what end we cannot know. DANNY, apprehensively eyeing
the TEACHER, slides the twenty into the transistor radio’s
cover-sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>x-ray cone</strong>: A huge white rubberized cone, pointed
directly at us. We hear a rush of static and the DOCTOR’s voice filtered
through a talk-back: DOCTOR’s Voice Hold still. Wider: LARRY is in his
shorts lying on his back on an examining table covered by a sheet of
tissue paper. The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of his body. There
is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum. It clicks off.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school</strong>: The clock-watching student’s head is
making descending bobs toward his chest.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh?! The
TEACHER’s circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind DANNY.
DANNY’s book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the
white cord snakes out from under it up to his ear. The TEACHER yanks at
the cord.</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: Shechet! Shechet bivakasha! The nodding
student’s head droops ever lower. Other students join in the chant:</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s office</strong>: LARRY, now fully clothed, is seated
across from the DOCTOR. The DOCTOR is looking at his file. He absently
taps a cigarette out of a pack and lights up. He nods as he smokes,
looking at the file.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, I-sorry. He holds the pack toward
LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, you’re in good health. How’re Judith
and the kids?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Good. Everyone’s good. You know. The DOCTOR
takes a long suck.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Good. Daniel must be-what? About to be bar
mitzvah?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, mazel tov. They grow up fast, don’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>tinted photo portrait</strong>: The portrait, old, in an
ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged rabbi with a small neat mustache
and round spectacles. He wears a tallis hood-style and a phylactery box
is strapped to his forehead. A plaque set into the frame identifies the
man as Rabbi Minda. Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew
school principal’s office, a white cinderblock room. It is quiet. The
only sound is a deep electrical hum. Just visible behind the principal’s
desk, upon which is a low stack of books and a name plate identifying
the occupant as MAR TURCHIK, is the top of a man’s head-an old man, with
a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not. DANNY, seated
opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see across the desk. We
boom up to show more of the principal. He is short. He wears a white
shirt and hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits. He has
thick eyeglasses. He fiddles with the transistor radio, muttering:</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Hmm… eh… nu?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You put the- The old man holds up one
hand.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: In ivrit.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Um… The old man looks down at the little
earpiece pinched between two fingers. He examines it as a superstitious
native might a Coca-Cola bottle. The source of the electrical hum: a
wall clock whose red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very
slowly. The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece. DANNY sighs. He
encourages:</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, you- The principal’s tone is
harder:</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: In ivrit! This time his cold look holds
until he is sure that the admonishment has registered. He looks back
down at the earpiece. We hear the door open. The principal ignores it.
An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer. She
has thick eyeglasses. She wears thick flesh-colored support hose. She
takes slow, short steps toward the desk. The principal is studying the
radio.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Mneh… The old woman continues to take
slow short steps toward him. The tableau looks like a performance-art
piece. She reaches the desk and sets the teacup down. She summons a
couple of phlegm- hawking rasps and turns to go. She takes slow short
steps toward the door. The principal raises the earpiece experimentally
toward his ear. Close on his hairy, wrinkled ear as his trembling
fingers bring in the earpiece. The i f ngers push and wobble and tamp
the earpiece into place, hesitate, and then do some more pushing and
wobbling and tamping. The principal keeps DANNY fixed with a stare as
his hand hesitantly drops from his ear, ready to reach back up should
the earpiece loosen. .mneh… Satisfied that neither the student nor the
earpiece are about to make any sudden moves, he looks down at the radio.
He turns a dial. Faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the
compressed jangle of rock music. The rabbi stares blankly, listening.
DANNY slumps, looking warily at the rabbi. The rabbi continues to stare
down at the radio. The compressed rock music jangles on. The rabbi is
expressionless, mouth slightly open, listening. Tableau: anxious
student, earplugged spiritual leader. Muffled, from the outer office,
the hawking of phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>classroom</strong>: We are behind a man who writes equations
on a chalkboard, shoulder at work and hand quickly waggling.
Periodically he glances back, giving us a fleeting look at his face: it
is</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You following this?… Okay?.. So… Heh-heh…
This part is exciting… Students follow along, bored. LARRY continues to
write. . So, okay. So. So if that’s that, then we can do this, right? Is
that right? Isn’t that right? And that’s Schrodinger’s paradox, right?
Is the cat dead or is the cat not dead? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>blegen hall</strong>: LARRY is entering the physics
department office. The department’s secretary wheels her castored chair
away from her typing.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Messages, Professor Gopnik. He takes the
three phone messages.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Thank you, Natalie. Oh-CLIVE. Come in. A
Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked chair
rises.</p>
<p><strong>larry’s office</strong>: He is flipping through the messages.
Absently:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So, uh, what can I do for you? The messages:
WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton OF Columbia Record Club</p>
<p><strong>called.</strong>: REGARDING: “Please call.” WHILE YOU WERE
OUT Sy Ableman</p>
<p><strong>called.</strong>: REGARDING “Let’s talk.” WHILE YOU WERE OUT
CLIVE Park</p>
<p><strong>called.</strong>: REGARDING: “Unjust test results.” He
crumples the last one.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Uh, Dr. Gopnik, I believe the results of
Physics Mid-Term were unjust.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh-huh, how so?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I received an unsatisfactory grade. In fact:
F, the failing grade.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh, yes. You failed the mid-term. That’s
accurate.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Yes, but this is not just. I was unaware to
be examined on the mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well-you can’t do physics without
mathematics, really, can you.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: If I receive failing grade I lose my
scholarship, and feel shame. I understand the physics. I understand the
dead cat.</p>
<p>****: You understand the dead cat?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Very difficult… very difficult…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, I… I’m sorry, but I… what do you
propose?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Passing grade.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No no, I-</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Or perhaps I can take the mid-term again. Now
I know it covers mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, the other students wouldn’t like that,
would they. If one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade
he likes. CLIVE impassively considers this.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Secret test. LARRY wraps a hand wearily over
his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . No, I’m afraid-</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Hush-hush.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, that’s just not workable. I’m afraid
we’ll just have to bite the bullet on this thing, CLIVE, and-</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Very troubling. He rises. . very troubling…
He goes to the door, shaking his head, as LARRY looks on in surprise. He
leaves. LARRY stares at the open door. The secretary outside, her back
to us, types on. LARRY. looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his
head. He picks up the phone message from Sy Ableman-“Let’s talk”-and
dials. As he dials his other hand wanders over the papers on the
desktop. There is a plain white envelope on the desk. LARRY picks it up
as the phone rings through. A ring is clipped short and a warm
basso-baritone rumbles through the line: Phone Voice Sy Ableman.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hello, Sy, LARRY Gopnik.</p>
<p>****: LARRY. How are you, my friend. LARRY picks idly at the
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Good, how’ve you been, Sy?</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Oh fine. Shall we talk LARRY. LARRY reacts to
the money.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What?! Oh! Sorry! I, uh-call back! He slams
down the phone.</p>
<p><strong>. clive!</strong>: He rushes out the door, through the
secretarial area, and into the hallway, and looks up toward the
elevators. Empty. He looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds. He
goes back to the departmental office. The secretary sits typing. She
glances at him and, as she goes back to her typing:</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sy Ableman just called. Said he got
disconnected.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom door</strong>: A hand enters to knock. Man’s Voice
Out in a minute! SARAH, the sixteen-year-old girl who has just knocked,
rolls her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I gotta wash my hair! I’m going out
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Out in a minute!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jesus Christ! She stomps down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>kitchen</strong>: Judith, a woman of early middle age, is at
the stove. SARAH enters.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: W is Uncle Arthur always in the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: He has to drain his sebacious cyst. You know
that. Will you set the table?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why can’t he do it in the basement? Or go out
in the garage!</p>
<p><strong>bus</strong>: We are raking the exterior of an orange school
bus as it rattles along. Hebrew characters on the side identify it-to
some, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: We are locked down on DANNY as the bus
rattles like an old crate, squeaking, grinding gears, belching exhaust.
DANNY and the children around him vibrate and pitch about but, from
their lack of reaction, seem used to it. They raise their voices to be
heard over the engine noise and the various stress noises in the chassis
and a transistor radio somewhere that plays Jefferson Airplane.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I had twenty bucks in it too. Inside the
case.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I bought a lid from Mike Fagle. Couple weeks
ago. I still owed him twenty. Mark Sallerson He already gave you the
pot?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah but a couple weeks ago my funding got
cut off. Fagle said he’d pound the crap out of me if I didn’t pay up.
Howard Altar What funding got cut off? Where do you get your money?
Another boy, with thick glasses, is Ronnie Nudell. Ronnie Nudell What
happened? Mark Sallerson Rabbi Turchik took his radio. Had money in it.
Ronnie Nudell That fucker!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah. I think he said he was confiscating it.
Ronnie Nudell He’s a fucker! Where do you get your money? Mark Sallerson
Mike Fagle’s gonna kick his ass. Last week he pounded the crap out of
Seth Seddlemeyer.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom door</strong>: A hand enters to knock. Uncle
Arthur’s Voice Out in a minute!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you still in there?! Uncle Arthur I, uh..
. Just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ve gotta wash my hair! I’m going out
tonight, to the hole! Uncle Arthur Okay!</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: LARRY pulls into the driveway and gets out
of the car. The purr of a lawn mower. He looks. His point-of-view: Gar
Brandt, the next-door neighbor, is mowing his lawn. He has a buzz cut
and is wearing a white T-shirt. Another noise competes with the lawn
mower: rattling, squeaking, gear-grinding. The orange school bus with
Hebrew lettering pulls up across the street. Its door opens with a
pneumatic hiss to discharge a passenger.</p>
<p><strong>dinner table</strong>: LARRY sits in. His wife and two
children are already seated. There is one empty place. LARRY
projects:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur! A muffled voice:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Dinner!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Okay! Out in a minute!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We should wait.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you kidding! They start eating.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Mr. Brandt keeps mowing part of our lawn.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Does that matter?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is it important? LARRY shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s just odd.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Any news on your tenure?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I think they’ll give me tenure.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You think.</p>
<p>****: Well, I don’t know. These things aren’t, you know.. .</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No, I don’t know. Which is why I ask.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur staying with
us?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Ask your father.</p>
<p><strong>back yard</strong>: Twilight. LARRY is stepping onto a hose
as he unwheels it from the drum of a traveling sprinkler, laying out an
are to cover the back yard. Intermittent thwacks from next door: Gar
Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white T-shirt, throw a
baseball back and forth. Gar Brandt throws hard. The ball pops in the
boy’s mitt.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Ow. LARRY walks over to the boundary defined
by the fresh mowing. He sights down it. Gar Brandt looks over his
shoulder at LARRY, looking. Gar Brandt is expressionless. He</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Evening. Lights on. LARRY sits at the
kitchen table, a briefcase open on the chair next to him. Blue
books-examination booklets-are spread on the table in front of him. He
reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading. From off, faint
and dulled by intervening walls, rock music: somewhere in the house
DANNY is listening to the Jefferson Airplane. The clink of teaspoon
against china as LARRY stirs his tea. He looks up at a noise: JUDY
enters.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Honey.</p>
<p>****: Honey.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Did you talk to Sy? Still absent, without
looking up:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sy?-Sy Ableman!-That’s right, he called, but
I-</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You didn’t talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, I-</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You know the problems you and I have been
having. Sympathetic, but still absent:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well, Sy and I have become very close. This
brings LARRY’s head up. He focuses on JUDY, puzzled. She elaborates:
In.short: I think it’s time to start talking about a divorce. LARRY
stares at her. A long beat. At length, trying to digest:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Sy Ableman!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: This is not about Sy.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You mentioned Sy!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Don’t twist my words. We-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: A divorce-what have I done! I haven’t done
anything- What have I done!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: LARRY, don’t be a child. You haven’t “done”
anything. I haven’t “done” anything.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes! Yes! We haven’t done anything! And I-I’m
probably about to get tenure!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Nevertheless, there have been problems. As you
know.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: And things have changed. And then-Sy Ableman.
Sy has come into my life. And now-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Come into your-what does that mean?! You,
you, you, you barely know him!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We’ve known the Ablemans for fifteen
years.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes, but you you said we hadn’t done
anything! JUDY suddenly is stony:</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I haven’t done anything. This is not some
flashy fling. This is not about woopsy-doopsy. LARRY stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sy Ableman! From down the hall, a knock on a
door. A muffled voice:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Out in a minute!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Look, I didn’t know any other way of breaking
it to you. Except to tell you. And treat you like an adult. Is that so
wrong? LARRY does not seem to be listening. His eyes roam the room as he
thinks.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Where do I sleep? JUDY narrows her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur’s on the couch!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Look. Sy feels that we should-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Esther is barely cold!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Esther died three years ago. And it was a
loveless marriage. Sy wants a Gett. This derails the conversation. LARRY
stares, trying to pick up the thread.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . A what?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: A ritual divorce. He says it’s very important.
Without a Gett I’m an Aguna.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: A what? What are you talking about? She turns
to go, shaking her head, peeved:</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You always act so surprised. As she leaves: I
have begged you to see the Rabbi.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen
table, face-down in a pile of blue books. Cold blue light sweeps across
him and he looks up.</p>
<p><strong>blegen hall</strong>: LARRY enters the departmental office.
His eyes are red-rimmed and dark-bagged. He has beard stubble. The
department’s secretary wheels her castored chair away from her
typing.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Messages, Professor Gopnik. He takes the
two phone messages.</p>
<p><strong>his office</strong>: LARRY looks at the messages: WHILE YOU
WERE OUT Dick Dutton OF Columbia Record Club</p>
<p><strong>called.</strong>: REGARDING: “2°d attempt. Please call.”
WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman</p>
<p><strong>called.</strong>: REGARDING “Let’s have a good talk.” A knock
brings his look up.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes-thanks for coming, CLIVE. CLIVE Park
enters the office.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I didn’t leave it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well–you don’t even know what I was going to
say.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I didn’t leave anything. I’m not missing
anything. I know where everything is. LARRY looks at him, trying to
formulate a thought.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well… then, CLIVE, where did this come from?
He waves the envelope. . This is here, isn’t it? CLIVE looks at it
gravely.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Yes, sir. That is there.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: This is not nothing, this is something.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Yes sir. That is something. A beat. . What is
it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You know what it is! You know what it is! I
believe. And</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Of course, sir.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’ll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle,
along with my suspicions about where it came from. Actions have
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Yes. Often.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Always! Actions always have consequences! He
pounds the desk for emphasis. In this office, actions have
consequences!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not just physics. Morally.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And we both know about your actions.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: No sir. I know about my actions.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can interpret, CLIVE. I know what you meant
me to understand.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Meer sir my sir. LARRY cocks his head.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Meer sir my sir?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Mere… surmise. Sir. He gravely shakes his
head. . Very uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>close on a tone arm</strong>: A hand lays it onto a slowly
spinning vinyl record. Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a
mournful Hebrew chant. Close on the sleeve: Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt
Chants Your Haftorah Portion</p>
<p><strong>volume 12</strong>: Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt
hat and has sad eyes. They peer out from the dark beard that covers most
of the rest of his face like owl’s eyes peering out of the woods. Wider,
on DANNY, in his bedroom, evening. He lifts the tone arm on the portable
turntable. He chants the passage. He drops the tone arm at the same
place; Rabbi Youssele chants the passage again. DANNY listens, eyes
narrowed. He lifts the tone arm and chants the passage again. He replays
the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm to echo it his door
bursts open. Rabbi Youssele continues to chant.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You little brat fucker! You snuck twenty
bucks out of my drawer!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Studying torah! Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You little brat! I’m telling Dad!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh yeah? You gonna tell him you’ve been
sneaking it out of his wallet?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: All right, you know what I’m gonna do? You
little brat? If you don’t give it back? We hear the thunk of the front
door opening. DANNY stands, calling:</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>foyer</strong>: LARRY is entering with his briefcase. As he
stows it in the foyer closet DANNY’s voice continues, off:</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad, you gotta fix the aerial. Judith emerges
from the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Hello LARRY, have you thought about a
lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Honey, please! DANNY emerges from the
hall.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Can we discuss it later?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t get F Troop.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: LARRY, the children know. Do you think this
is some secret? Do you think this is something we’re going to keep
quiet? SARAH enters.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dad, Uncle Arthur is in the bathroom again!
And I=m going to the hole at eight! She hits DANNY on the back of the
head.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: SARAH! What’s going on!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: She keeps doing that!</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: LARRY sits in a reclining chair in the living
room, head back, listening to Sidor Belarsky on the hi-fi. On top of the
music is a hissing-sucking sound. There is also the sound of a pencil
busily scratching paper. We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits
scribbling into a spiral notebook, his free hand holding the end of a
length of surgical tubing against the back of his neck. The tube leads
to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the source of
the sucking sound. After a long beat of listening to the music, LARRY
speaks into space:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur? Uncle Arthur does not look up from
his scribbling. Uncle Arthur Yes. LARRY continues to stare at the
ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’re you doing? Still without looking up:
Uncle Arthur Working on the Mentaculus. Long beat. Music.
Scribbling.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Any luck, um, looking for an apartment? More
scribbling. Uncle Arthur No. The doorbell chimes.</p>
<p><strong>front door</strong>: LARRY enters, glances through the front
door’s head-height window, and-freezes, one hand arrested on the way to
the doorknob. His point-of-view: framed by the window, yellowly lit by
the stoop light, a human head. A middle-aged man, a few years older than
LARRY. A fleshy face with droopy hangdog features, a five-o’clock
shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes. LARRY opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sy. Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand. His
voice vibrates with a warm, sad empathy:</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Good to see you, LARRY. He is a heavy-set man
wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his belly tents out in front of him.
In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine.</p>
<p>****: I’ll get Judith.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: No, actually LARRY, I’m here to see you, if I
might. He shakes his head. . Such a thing. Such a thing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shall we go in the… He is leading him into
the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings, plows on with the
conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between kitchen
sink and stove, and invading LARRY’s space.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: You know, LARRY-how we handle ourselves, in this
situation-it’s so impawtant.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Absolutely. Judith told me that she broke the
news to you. She said you were very adult.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Did she.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Absolutely. The respect she has for you.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Absolutely. But the children, LARRY. The
children. He shakes his head. . The most impawtant.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, I guess…</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Of coss. And Judith says they’re handling it so
well. A tribute to you. Do you drink wine? Because this is an incredible
bottle. This is not Mogen David. This is a wine, LARRY. A bawdeaux.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You know, Sy-</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Open it-let it breathe. Ten minutes. Letting it
breathe, so impawtant.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Thanks, Sy, but I’m not-</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: I insist! No reason for discumfit. I’ll be
uncumftable if you don’t take it. These are signs and tokens, LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m just-I’m not ungrateful, I’m, I just
don’t know a lot about wine and, given our respective, you know- He is
startled when Sy abruptly hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>skewed angle on parking lot</strong>: We are dutch on a slit
of a view through a cracked-open frosted window: the Hebrew school
parking lot. The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling
out of the lot. It is late afternoon. A reverse shows DANNY in a stall,
standing on a closed toilet, angling his head to peer out the bathroom
window opened at the top. The bathroom outside the stall: Ronnie Nudell
leans against a sink waiting, sucking a long draw from a joint. DANNY
emerges from the stall. Ronnie Nudell offers the joint. Ronnie Nudell
Want some of this fucker?</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: The bathroom door cracks open in the
foreground. DANNY peeks out. His point-of-view: the empty hallway ending
in a T with another hallway. A janitor crosses, pushing a broom down the
far hallway. He disappears. His echoing footsteps recede. DANNY and
Ronny emerge from the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>rabbi minda</strong>: The photo-portrait on the wall of Mar
Turchik’s office lit by late-day sun. We hear a scraping sound.</p>
<p><strong>sanctuary</strong>: We are behind the two boys who sit side
by side on the last pew, staring at the front of the empty sanctuary.
Its stained glass windows further weaken the late-afternoon light. In
deference to the location, the boys wear yarmulkas. A long hold on their
still backs. At length, some movement in DANNY’s back, his head dips,
and we hear him sucking on the joint. He holds it, exhales, and passes
it wordlessly to Ronnie Nudell.</p>
<p><strong>suburban street</strong>: We are pulling DANNY as he walks
along the street, eyes red-rimmed, still wearing his yarmulka. It is
dusk. After a few beats of walking, the front door of a house just
behind DANNY opens. A husky, shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run. The
sound has alerted DANNY. Seeing Mike Fagle, he too begins to run. He
reaches up and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping
fists. Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly, panting, feet pounding.
Mike Fagle is closing. But DANNY is already cutting across the Brandt’s
front yard, approaching his own. He plunges into the house and slams the
door. Mike Fagle draws up, panting, gazing hungrily at the house.</p>
<p><strong>puffy white clouds</strong>: A shockingly blue sky with
picture-perfect clouds hanging in it. After a beat the top of an
aluminum extension ladder swings in from the bottom of the frame and
comes toward us. We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a
roof. It starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone climbing.
Hands enter. LARRY’s head enters. He climbs onto the roof. He takes a
couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively, making sure of
his balance. He looks around. His point-of-view towards the front. An
unfamiliarly high perspective on the street and the neighboring houses,
almost maplike. Very peaceful. Wind rhythmically, gently waves the
trees. LARRY gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof. We
are hearing a rhythmic popping noise. LARRY reaches the peak and
straddles it. He looks down at the back yard.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Ow. Foreshortened Gar Brandt and Mitch are
playing catch in their back yard. With each toss the ball pops,
alternately in father’s mitt and son’s. Precariously balanced, LARRY
reaches out for the aerial. He tentatively touches it. He grasps it. He
twists the aerial.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Ow. Faintly, under the wineglass sound, and
clouded by static, a high, ringing tenor sings in an unfamiliar
modality. Cantorial music. LARRY drops his hand. Inertia keeps the
aerial rotating slowly til it dies, the sound drifting away into the
sybillant shushing of trees. LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial.
The same crystal hum… cantorial singing… and now, layering in, the theme
from F Troop. Music. Crystal hum. Wind.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Ow. LARRY’s look travels: his point-of-view
pans slowly off the steep angle of father and son playing catch, travels
across his own backyard, and brings in the white fence that encloses the
patio of the neighbor on the other side. Gar Good toss, Mitch. On the
enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon bands woven
over an aluminum frame. She is on her back, eyes closed against the sun.
She is naked. Mitch Ow. LARRY reacts to the naked woman: startled at
first, he moves to hide behind the peak of the roof. But as he realizes
that the sun keeps the woman’s eyes closed he relaxes, continu- ing to
stare. She is attractive. Not young, not old: LARRY’s age. Peaceful.
After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side. It finds
an ashtray on the table next to her and takes from it a pluming
cigarette. The woman takes a puff and replaces it.</p>
<p><strong>notebook</strong>: A pencil scratches equations into a
lamplit spiral notebook. Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut. So does the
spluttering suck-sound of Uncle Arthur’s evacuator. Wider on Uncle
Arthur, in his pyjamas, propped up on the narrow fold-out sofa, writing
with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck with the other.
Squeezed into the living room next to the fold-out sofa is a camp cot of
plaid-patterned nylon stretched over an aluminum frame. On the camp cot
is LARRY, lying half-in, half- out of a rumpled sleeping bag. He stares
at the ceiling, a damp washcloth pressed against his forehead. His face
is flaming red. Arthur speaks absently as he scribbles:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Will you read this? Tell me what you think?
LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. Uncle Arthur glances up from the
notebook, focuses on LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Boy. You should’ve worn a hat.</p>
<p><strong>kitchen</strong>: LARRY, in his underwear, spoons ground
coffee into the percolator. Uncle Arthur snores softly on in the other
room. From outside, a dull thunk. LARRY pulls back a curtain. Next door,
Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage togs and camo
billed cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder. He is carrying an ice
chest, its contents clicking and sloshing. The boy Mitch, also wearing
camo clothes and cap and also with a rifle bag, has just closed the
front door. He now lets the screen door swing shut behind him and
follows his father down the walk to the car in the driveway. The twitter
of early morning birds. Gar’s voice, though not projected, stands out in
the pre-dawn quiet:</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Let’s see some hustle, Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>close on the notebook</strong>: Its top sheet, densely
covered by equations, has a heading: The Mentaculus Compiled by Arthur
Gopnik After a beat LARRY’s hand enters to turn the page. The second
page is also densely covered with equations.</p>
<p><strong>larry?</strong>: This brings LARRY’s look up from the
Mentaculus. We are in LARRY’s office. Standing in the office doorway is
Arlen Finkle.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hi Arlen. Arlen Finkle LARRY, I feel that, as
head of the tenure committee I should tell you this, though it should be
no cause for concern. You should not be at all worried. LARRY waits for
more. Arlen seems to need a prompt.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. Arlen Finkle I feel I should mention it
even though we won’t give this any weight at all in considering whether
to grant you tenure, so, I repeat no cause for concern.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay, Arlen. Give what any weight? Arlen
Finkle We have received some letters, uh… denigrating you, and, well,
urging that we not grant you tenure.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: From who? Arlen Finkle They’re anonymous. And
so of course we dismiss them completely.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well… well… what do they say? Arlen Finkle
They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: But… I think you’re saying, these won’t play
any part in your deliberations. Arlen Finkle None at all.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Um, so what are they… Arlen Finkle Moral
turpitude. You could say.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh-huh. Can I ask, are they, are
they-idiomatic? Arlen Finkle I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The reason I ask, I have a Korean student,
South Korean, disgruntled South Korean, and I meant to talk to you about
this, actually, he- Arlen Finkle No. No, the letters are
competently-even eloquently written. A native English-speaker. No
question about that.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh-huh. Arlen Finkle But I reiterate this,
LARRY: no cause for concern. I only speak because I would have felt odd
concealing it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes, okay, thank you Arlen.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school exterior</strong>: Day. Somewhere inside the
school a bell rings. Its doors swing open and children emerge. Our angle
is down a line of school busses, each with the the same stenciled Hebrew
lettering, waiting to ferry the children home. We are tracking toward
the busses to steepen the rake. As children sort themselves out and
climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the nearest bus
into the fore- ground. It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and
stress sounds, its low coughing engine ominously rumbling. Children
start climbing on.</p>
<p><strong>minutes later</strong>: Inside the bus, now moving. Engine
noise bangs in louder and air roars in through open windows. We are on
the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt with earlocks
and a yarmulke. He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel and
gear shift as the vehicle bucks. The pitching children. Somewhere,
Jefferson Airplane plays.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I gotta get my radio back. Ronnie Nudell
Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I gotta get it back. Or Mike Fagle’s gonna
pound the crap out of me. Ronnie Nudell</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And I’ll still have to get my sister the
money back or she’s gonna break four of my records. Twenty bucks, four
records. Howard Altar How do you buy all those records. Where do you get
your funds.</p>
<p><strong>close on larry</strong>: Standing in his yard. His eyes are
darkly pouched. He is staring at something, it seems in distress. We
hear a fluttering sound. His point-of-view: stakes are set out in the
Brandts’ yard. Red ribbon connecting them outlines a projection from the
side of the house. The loose ends of the ribbon flutter in the breeze.
Engine noise brings LARRY’s look around. A car is arriving. It is the
Brandts’ car, oddly burdened. As it pulls into their driveway we see
that there is a four-point stag strapped to the hood, its head lolling
over the grille. Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting
fatigues. Blood is smeared on Gar’s shirt.</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Go scrub up, Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh, good afternoon. This brings Gar’s look
around. Apparently he is unused to talking with his neighbor. There is a
short beat before his response.</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Afternoon. In the background of his angle is
the dead buck, staring off through sightless eyes.</p>
<p>****: . Been hunting?</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is that a, uh… He is indicating the staked
area. Gar looks around at it, looks back at LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Gonna be a den.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh-huh, that’s great. Uh, Mr. Brandt- Gar
barks at Mitch, who has lingered to listen to the grown-ups:</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: I said scrub up, Mitch! The child quickly goes.
LARRY frowns.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Isn’t this a school day?</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Took him out of school today. So he could hunt
with his dad.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh! He nods. . That’s.. . nice. Gar stares at
him with button eyes. Small talk is not his thing. LARRY clears his
throat.</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Property line’s the poplar.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . the. ?</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Poplar!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Well.. . even if it is, you’re just about
over it</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Measure. We hear two pairs of pounding
footsteps coming up the street.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t have to measure, you can tell
it’s…</p>
<p><strong>gar</strong>: Line’s the poplar. He indicates. . It’s all
angles. Gar Brandt turns and goes. LARRY turns, reacting to the pounding
footsteps. One of the two pairs belongs to DANNY who arrives, slowing to
a walk, panting, a bookbag over his shoulder. A half-block back the
pursuing boy also stops running. Husky, shaggy-haired, he watches,
scowling, as DANNY goes up the walk to his house. LARRY addresses
DANNY’s retreating back:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>in the house</strong>: As LARRY enters. Judith</p>
<p>****: Yeah? Judith Did you go to Sieglestein Schlutz? No, I-not
yet.</p>
<p><strong>larry.</strong>: Appointment Monday. The thud of a car door
outside. SARAH heads for the front door, pulling on a jacket. LARRY is
surprised. . Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m going to the hole.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: At five o’clock? He looks out the front-door
window. Four girls of SARAH’s age are coming up the walk</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re stopping at Laurie Kipperstein’s house
so I can wash my hair. LARRY pulls open the door just as the doorbell
rings. From the four dark girls:</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Hi, Mr. Gopnik.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You can’t wash it here? From somewhere in the
house, Jefferson Airplane starts. As she brushes past LARRY:</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Uncle Arthur’s in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Out in a minute! Judith enters.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: We’re meeting Sy at Embers.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Both of us. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: LARRY. How are you.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sy.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Hello Judith.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Hello Sy. Once Sy releases LARRY, all seat
themselves at Sy’s booth, Judith next to Sy, LARRY facing.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Thank you for coming, LARRY. It’s so impawtant
that we be able to discuss these things.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m happy to come to Embers, Sy, but, I’m
thinking, really, maybe it’s best to leave these discussions to the
lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Of coss! Legal matters, let the lawyers discuss!
Don’t mix apples and oranges!</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: I’ve beamed you to see the lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I told you, I’m going Monday.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Monday is timely! This isn’t-please!-Embers
isn’t the forum for legalities, you are so right!</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Hmph.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: No, Judith and I thought merely we should
discuss the practicalities, the living arrangements, a situation that
will conduce to the comfit of all the parties. This is an issue where no
one is at odds. LARRY isn’t sure where this is leading:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Living arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Absolutely. I think we all agree, the children
not being contaminated by the tension-the most impawtant.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: We shouldn’t put the kids in the middle of
this, LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The kids aren’t-</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: I’m saying “we.” I’m not pointing
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: No one is playing the “blame game,” LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I didn’t say anyone was!</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Well let’s not play He said, She said,
either.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I wasn’t! I. —</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Aw right, well let’s just step back, and defuse
the situation,</p>
<p><strong>larry.</strong>: LARRY glares at Sy.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Really, to keep things on an even keel,
especially now, leading up to DANNY’s bar mitzvah-</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: A child’s bar mitzvah, LARRY!</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Sy and I think it’s best if you move out of
the house.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Move out?!</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: It makes eminent sense.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Things can’t continue as they-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Move out! Where would I go?!</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: Well, for instance, the Jolly Roger is quite
livable. Not expensive, and the rooms are eminently livable.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: This would allow you to visit the kids.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: There’s convenience in its fava. There’s a
pool-</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: LARRY, you’re jesting!</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: LARRY, there is much to accomplish before
that can happen. Sy is sadly shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>sy</strong>: LARRY, LARRY, LARRY. I think, really, the Jolly
Roger is the appropriate coss of action. He shrugs. It has a pool.</p>
<p><strong>in black and white: a brain</strong>: It sits in a large
fishbowl filled with clear fluid. The brain, alive, pulses. Leads
connect it to various pieces of gear outside the fishbowl. Brain and
appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out with bunting. Oddly,
the picture is scored with cantorial singing. The brain seems to be
giving orders to people who wear imperfectly form-fitting 1950’s
uniforms of the future. After receiving their instructions the minions
of the brain kowtow before it and leave. They are succeeded by two
leather-helmeted thugs, big and heavy though lacking muscle definition,
who escort a resisting handsome man before the brain. The handsome man,
hands tied behind his back, gazes defiantly up at the brain which in
some fashion addresses him. We hear blows and voices over the cantorial
music:</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Creep fucker!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Stop it! I’m getting it! I’m gonna get it!
Wider shows that the brain is on television, which DANNY has muted while
he plays the Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt record and drills his torah
portion. He and SARAH are in a stand-off, hands tensed to either deliver
or ward off blows.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Brat! LARRY enters.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p>****: Nothing. She closes the door behind her.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How’s the haftorah coming? Can you maybe use
the hi-fi?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What? We hear the doorbell off. LARRY
indicates the portable record player.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Sure Dad. On TV, the handsome man shouts
defiance at the brain. From off, SARAH projects:</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dad. Chinese guy.</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: A middle-aged Korean man, well groomed.
He wears a nicely cut suit and a jeweled tie- pin.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Culcha clash. He bangs his two knuckles
together, illustrating. . Culcha clash. He faces LARRY in the driveway.
LARRY’s car is half-loaded with open boxes that are haphazardly stuffed
with clothing and effects. LARRY is leaning against the hood, arms
folded, gazing at the man, unimpressed. A long beat. Finally he bestirs
himself.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: With all respect, Mr. Park, I don’t think
it’s that. Mr. Park Yes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No. It would be a culture clash if it were
the custom in your land to bribe people for grades. Mr. Park Yes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So-you’re saying it is the custom? Mr. Park
No. This is defamation. Grounds for lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You-let me get this straight-you’re
threatening to sue me for defaming your son? Mr. Park Yes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: But it would- Gar Brandt Is this man
bothering you. Gar Brandt stands on the strip of lawn separating the two
neighbors. He is giving Mr. Park a hard stare.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is he bothering me? No. We’re fine. Thank
you, Mr. Brandt. Gar Brandt, not entirely convinced, withdraws, glaring
at the Korean. LARRY turns back to Mr. Park. . I, uh. . See, if it were
defamation there would have to be someone I was defaming him to, or I…
All right, I… let’s keep it simple. I could pretend the money never
appeared. That’s not defaming anyone.</p>
<p><strong>bl</strong>: Mr. Park Yes. And passing grade.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Passing grade. Mr. Park Yes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Or you’ll sue me. Mr. Park For taking
money.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So.. . he did leave the money. Mr. Park This
is defamation. LARRY stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look. It doesn’t make sense. Either he left
the money or he didn’t Mr. Park Please. Accept mystery.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You can’t have it both ways! If Mr. Park Why
not. LARRY stares. We hear Sidor Belarsky music.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hello… He brightens. . Fine, Mimi, how are
you?… Uh-huh… No, it’s not that bad… It’s not that bad… There’s a pool…
Arthur emerges from an alcove in the dim depth of the room that has a
dressing-room mirror and apparently connects to the bathroom. He has a
hand towel pressed to the back of his neck. . Oh sure, that sounds
great. . . Oh, great, then I’ll bring</p>
<p><strong>lake nokomis</strong>: The beach: families are crowded onto
the small beach of a freshwater lake, children cavorting, adults
lounging, much sun, few umbrellas. Red floats connected by red nylon
rope define a swimming area; beyond it people dive from an anchored
raft. Splashing and children’s laughter slap off the surface of the
lake.</p>
<p><strong>woods</strong>: Above the lake. The beach noise has some
distance. It also has a faintly bizarre canyon echo. There is a present,
sybillant shushing of breeze in the trees. It is dark here with intense
hot spots where sun sifts through the leaf cover. We are close on DANNY,
who sits very still, leaning back against a tree trunk.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Gimme that fucker. DANNY passes the joint to
Ronnie Nudell, who sits opposite.</p>
<p><strong>picnic area</strong>: On a woodless rise above the lake. Each
of the separate picnic areas consist of a redwood table and benches
placed next to a firepit. Here in the sun both LARRY and Mel Nudell, a
man slightly older than LARRY, glisten with sweat. Mel, in the
background, bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes to spill some into the
firepit. LARRY sits at the table in the foreground with Mimi Nudell who
alone seems unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical
environment. Her pale, gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a
large-brimmed hat.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No. Almost a year and a half since Touche
Ross let him go. He’s very good with numbers. I think his, his social
skills have held him back.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Such a sweet man though.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur has a good heart. And he never
complains, unlike me. Sometimes I don’t give him enough credit.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: He tried to tell me about this thing he’s
working on, this, um…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The Mentaculus? He says it’s a, uh. a
probability map. Of the universe. He asked if I could help him publish
it. Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Does he go out socially at all?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He tries. He’s been going to the singles
mixers at Hillel House.-Well, I should talk, I’m not doing any
better.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: How is Judith?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Fine. She’s fine. I’m the odd man out. Mimi
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Sometimes these things just aren’t meant to
be. And it can take a while before you feel what was always there, for
better or worse.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I never felt it! It was a bolt from the blue!
What does that mean! Everything that I thought was one way turns out to
be another!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Then-it’s an opportunity to learn how things
really are. LARRY broods. Mimi softens. . I’m sorry-I don’t mean to
sound glib. It’s not always easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: But it’s not something you have to figure out
all by your- self. We’re Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw
on, to help us understand. When we’re puzzled we have all the</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Have you talked to Rabbi Nachtner? Silence.
Arthur is climbing the hill from the lake, dripping wet. He
projects:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Boy! The air out here is magnificent! Mimi,
looking at LARRY, responds to his dark silence:</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Why not see him? Mel Nudell has finished
spreading and lighting the coals. He now comes and sits next to Mimi,
draping an arm over her shoulder. She strokes his hand, still looking at
LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s the rabbi gonna tell me?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: If I knew I’d be the rabbi. He looks at her
glumly. She laughs. . Life is beautiful, LARRY. Nobody’s sick. Nobody
died. You just need help remembering how to enjoy it. She rests her head
against Mel’s shoulder. . Where are the kids?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Woods. Exploring. Uncle Arthur approaches, swim
trunks plastered to his thighs, hair dripping, one hand</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: If somebody could bottle this air they’d
make a million bucks! A white title comes up: The First Rabbi</p>
<p><strong>synagogue office anteroom</strong>: Day. LARRY sits waiting.
A door opens and he rises.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh-Rabbi Scott. Rabbi Scott Ginzler is the
junior rabbi, a man in his twenties. Rabbi Scott Hello LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I thought I was going to see Rabbi Nachtner.
Rabbi Scott He was called away on an etz monim: Ruth Brynn’s mother is
in the hospital and she isn’t doing well. Rabbi Nachtner asked me to
cover for him-come on in.</p>
<p><strong>rabbi scott’s office</strong>: A few minutes later. LARRY
sits tensely hunched forward facing Rabbi Scott.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And she wants a Gett. A long silence. The hum
of ventilation. At length:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She wants a- Rabbi Scott Oh, a Gett. Uh-huh,
sure.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I feel like the carpet’s been yanked out from
under me. I don’t know which end is up. I’m not even sure how to react;
I’m too confused. Rabbi Scott What reasons did she give? For the
rupture?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She didn’t give-reasons. Just that, oh, you
know, things haven’t been going well. Rabbi Scott And is that true?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I guess. I don’t know. She’s usually right
about these things. Rabbi Scott Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I feel so… addled. Rabbi Scott Yes, I can
see.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I was hoping that… Rabbi Nachtner… Rabbi
Scott That he would… yes?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, with the benefit of his life
experience… no</p>
<p><strong>offense-</strong>: Rabbi Scott chuckles. Rabbi Scott No, of
course not. I am the junior rabbi. And it’s true, the point-of-view of
somebody who’s older and perhaps had similar problems might be more
valid. And you should see the senior rabbi as well, by all means. Or
even Minda if you can get in, he’s quite busy. But maybe-can I share
something with you? Because I too have had the feeling of losing track
of Hashem, which is the problem here. I too have forgotten how to see
Him in the world. And when that happens you think, well, if I can’t see
Him, He isn’t there any more, He’s gone. But that’s not the case. You
just need to remember how to see Him. Am I right? He rises and goes to
the window. I mean, the parking lot here. Not much to see. It is a
different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the Hebrew school
window. But if you imagine yourself a visitor, somebody who isn’t
familiar with these… autos and such… somebody still with a capacity for
wonder… Someone with a fresh… perspective. That’s what it is, LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Um… Rabbi Scott Because with the right
perspective you can see Hashem, you know, reaching into the world. He is
in the world, not just in shul. It souunds to me like you’re looking at
the world, looking at your wife, through tired eyes. It sounds like
she’s become a sort of… thing… a problem… a thing…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, she’s, she’s seeing Sy Ableman.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She’s, they’re planning, that’s why they want
the Gett. Rabbi Scott Oh. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It was his idea. Rabbi Scott Well, they do
need a Gett to remarry in the faith. But this is life. For you too. You
can’t cut yourself off from the mystical or you’ll be-you’ll
remain-completely lost. You have to see these things as expressions of
God’s will. You don’t have to like it, of course.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The boss isn’t always right, but he’s always
the boss. Rabbi Scott Ha-ha-ha! That’s right, things aren’t so bad. Look
at the parking lot, LARRY. Rabbi Scott gazes out, marveling. . Just look
at that parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>exterior: gopnik house</strong>: Our low angle looks across
the lawn toward the front of the house. Someone’s pounding footsteps
approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he quickly recedes,
cropping in as he races up to the house: DANNY. A beat later pursuing
feet enter, slowing-for DANNY is already mounting the front stoop.
DANNY’s pursuer does not go deep enough to crop in but we might gather
from the size eleven sneakers and the cuffed jeans that it is hulking
Mike Fagle.</p>
<p><strong>gopnik kitchen</strong>: We hear the front door being flung
open and slammed shut, and in the background foyer DANNY appears,
panting heavily. He gives one glance back toward the front door and then
looks at his mother and sister eating soup in the foreground. His sister
has a towel wrapped turbanlike around her head. She holds it with one
hand to keep it from tipping off when she tilts her head down for the
soup.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We eating already?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m going to the hole. DANNY enters the
kitchen and sits at the setting across from his sister. He picks up his
spoon. Some movement in SARAH’s body; DANNY recoils from a kick.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ow! Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: What’s going on? The siblings slurp soup,
neither answering. After a couple slurps: . Isn’t Dad eating?</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: He’s at the Jolly Roger.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh yeah. More eating.</p>
<p><strong>sieglestein, schlutz</strong>: In a small windowless
conference room lined by bookshelves filled with law reference books,
LARRY rises to greet Don Milgram, entering.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Don.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: How are you, LARRY, Jesus, I am so sorry to be
seeing you under these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh, well…</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: I always thought you and JUDY were rock solid.
This is so terrible, LARRY. This is devastating.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, the way I look at it, it’s an
opportunity for me to really sit down and figure things out, and, and,
look at the world afresh instead of just, you know, settling for the
routine, tired old way of looking at things. Don Milgram stares at
him.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: . Really?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Well, legally, I have to warn you, it’s never
easy for the husband. Unless, of course, there’s some question of the
wife having violated the marriage contract.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh no, nothing like that. She’s planning to
marry Sy Ableman, but they-</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Sy Ableman!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes, but they-</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Esther is barely cold!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She passed three years ago.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Well, okay, still-this changes the complexion,
LARRY! Sy Ableman!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not in the sense that… there hasn’t been
hanky-panky. To my knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No. I’m fairly certain this is not an issue.
And in fact they, uh, Judith wants a Gett. Beat. Don stares blankly at
LARRY. LARRY clears his throat. A ritual divorce.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So that they can remarry in the faith-</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Uh-huh, sure, not really a legal matter. Okay.
Well. My goodness. How are the children taking it?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh, they’re very… He gropes. . resilient.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Good. Well. On the other thing, the neighbor’s
property line, I’ve asked Solomon Schlutz to take a look. There’s very
little having to do with real estate that’ll get by Sol.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. Good. How do you-I guess I’m a little
worried, how do you, I have money pressures and-</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Our fee structure? We bill by the hour. Dave
Sieglestein and Solomon Schlutz bill at a hundred and ten, the associ-
ates, me for instance, bill at A secretary sticks her head in.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: A call for Mr. Gopnik. DANNY. At
home.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: You can take it here.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh-eight-oh-nine. LARRY punches a button
on a row of four on the conference-room telephone.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Are you all right? Are you all-is
everything-</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: F Troop is fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . What?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: F Troop is still fuzzy. LARRY stares.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>dawn at the jolly roger</strong>: Wide on the motel room,
dimly lit by weak sun starting to seep in around the curtain. LARRY
sleeps in one of the twin beds; Uncle Arthur snores in the other. Uncle
Arthur’s breath snags and tangles on a snorfling inhale and it wakes
him, gagging. He blinks, sits up, swings his legs out, gazes blearily
around the room. He rises stiffly and heads for the bathroom. LARRY
stirs. The sound of Uncle Arthur urinating. LARRY looks blearily around.
LARRY stiffly rises. He takes the two steps across the room to the
formica desk on which are spread papers for his class. As we hear the
sucking sound of the neck evacuator in the bathroom, LARRY sweeps papers
together and mechanically stuffs his briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>car</strong>: LARRY is driving, hollow-eyed, to work. After a
long beat of staring, the ka-ching of a bicycle bell.</p>
<p><strong>clive!</strong>: He starts frantically pumping down his
window, shouting: . CLIVE! You gonna send your mother next?! You little
bastard! I wanna see you! I wanna- Crash. He has rear-ended someone. A
blaring horn, a quick second crash: wrenching steel and spattering
glass. He has been rear-ended in turn. The ka-ching of the bicycle.
CLIVE Park cycles past without looking.</p>
<p><strong>blegen hall</strong>: LARRY enters the outer office, hugging
his paper-stuffed briefcase to his chest. The secretary is just crooking
the phone into her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh-Professor Gopnik. It’s Dick Dutton
again.</p>
<p>****: Dick Dutton.</p>
<p><strong>larry’s office</strong>: He sits in and picks up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello, Mr. Gopnik, this is Dick Dutton from
the Columbia Record Club. I’m calling because it is now, what, four
months and we have yet to receive your first payment.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I-there’s some mistake. I’m not a member of
the Columbian Record Club.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik of 1425 Flag
Avenue South?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, I live at the Jolly Roger.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, I-well, yes, okay.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes you are Lawrence Gopnik?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay means…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay, yes, Lawrence Gopnik, yes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay, well, you received your twelve
introductory albums and you have been receiving the monthly main
selection for four months now-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: “The monthly main selection?” Is that a
record? I didn’t</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: To receive the monthly main selection you do
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s right! I haven’t done anything!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes, that’s why you receive the monthly main
selection. The last</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: But I-</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The last one was Santana Abraxis. You-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I didn’t ask for Santana Abraxis!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You request the main selection at the retail
price by doing nothing. It is automatically mailed to you. Plus shipping
and handling. You’re about to-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can’t afford a new record every month! I
haven’t asked</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re about to get Cosmo’s Factory, sir. The
June main selection. And you haven’t-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look, something is very wrong! I don’t want
Santana Abraxis! I’ve just been in a terrible auto accident! Beat.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m sorry sir.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well-thank you. But I-</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes. Yes, no one was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay. Good. Well, you had fourteen days to
listen to Santana Abraxis and return it if you weren’t completely
satisfied. You did nothing. And now you-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I didn’t ask for Santana Abraxis! I didn’t
listen to Santana Abraxis! I didn’t do anything! The secretary is
sticking her head in.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sir. Please. We can’t make you listen to the
record. We-</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Professor Gopnik, your son. He said it’s
urgent.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay, look, I have to call you back, this is,
this is I’m sorry. He irritably punches a button on the bottom row of
four.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Did you join the Columbia Record Club?!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: DANNY, this is completely unacceptable. I
can’t afford to-</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay Dad, but you gotta come home.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is it F Troop?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Huh? No no. Mom’s real upset.</p>
<p><strong>gopnik house</strong>: LARRY enters. We can hear weeping,
semi-hysterical, from somewhere in the house. SARAH’s Voice .Dad?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes? She enters.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Does this mean I can’t go to the hole
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Does what mean-what happened?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sy Ableman died in a car crash. DANNY’s
Voice</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What?! DANNY enters.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So are you coming back home? Can you fix the
aerial? The weeping, off, grows louder and more hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s still, you know… Loud wailing.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: After a beat in black, a white title: The
Second Rabbi The title fades.</p>
<p><strong>rabbi’s office</strong>: We are close on LARRY. He sits
hunched forward, hands clasped in front of him, staring at the floor,
sadly shaking his head. After a long beat:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It seems like she’s asking an awful lot. But
then-I don’t know. Somebody has to pay for Sy’s funeral. Rabbi Nachtner,
sitting opposite, nods. Rabbi Nachtner</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: His own estate is in probate. But why does it
have to be me? Or is it wrong to complain? JUDY says it is. But I’m so
strapped for cash right now-paying for the Jolly Roger, and I wrecked
the car, and DANNY’s bar mitzvah… I… Rabbi Nachtner Something like
this-there’s never a good time.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t know where it all leaves me. Sy’s
death. Obviously it’s not going to go back like it was. Rabbi Nachtner
Mm. Would you even want that, LARRY?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, I-well yeah! Sometimes! Or-I don’t know;
I guess the honest answer is I don’t know. What was my life before? Not
what I thought it was. What does it all mean? What is Hashem trying to
tell me, making me pay for Sy Ableman’s funeral? Rabbi Nachtner Mm.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And-did I tell you I had a car accident the
same time Sy had his? The same instant, for all I know. Is Hashem
telling me that Sy Ableman is me, or we are all one or something? Rabbi
Nachtner How does God speak to us: it’s a good question. You know Lee
Sussman?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: DOCTOR Sussman? I think I-yeah. Rabbi
Nachtner Did he ever tell you about the goy’s teeth?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No… I-What goy? Rabbi Nachtner So Lee is at
work one day; you know he has the orthodontic practice there at
Texa-Tonka.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh-huh. Rabbi Nachtner Right next to the Gold
Eagle Cleaners. We cut to:</p>
<p><strong>sign for the gold eagle cleaners</strong>: It dominates a
small suburban strip mall. Rabbi Nachtner continues in voice-over as we
cut to a smoked glass door that identifies Leon Sussman, DDS. Rabbi
Nachtner He’s making a plaster mold-it’s for corrective bridge work-in
the mouth of one of his patients… A close shot of a man’s mouth biting
down on two horse-shoe shaped troughs-an upper and a lower-that overflow
an oozing white goo. . Russell Kraus. He’s a delivery dispatcher for the
Star and Tribune with chronic mandicular deterioration. The grinding
guitar solo from Jefferson Airplane’s “Bear Melt” scores the narrative.
The patient opens his mouth as a hand enters to grab the upper tray. The
reverse shows Dr. Sussman, a balding middle-aged man, dressed in the the
high- collared white smock of an oral surgeon. He carries the mold over
to a drying table. Kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting
into the water-swirled spit-sink. . Well, the mold dries and Lee is
examining it one day</p>
<p><strong>back to rabbi nachtner</strong>: He confirms with a nod.
Rabbi Nachtner This in a goy’s mouth, LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>back to leon sussman</strong>: The Rabbi’s narrative
continues. Rabbi Nachtner Tet resh nun lamed nun shin tsayin. What is
that-tiranu linoshets? “Help me”? Is that what it says? Or is it a name?
It’s not Kraus’s name. Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off,
haunted. He rises. He checks the mold, just to be sure. Oh, it’s there
all</p>
<p><strong>an elevated cubicle</strong>: In a grocery store. A man in
short sleeves reaches for the phone. Rabbi Nachtner It’s a Red Owl
grocery store in Bloomington. Hello? Do you know a goy named Kraus?
Russel Kraus? The store manager is shaking his head. Where have I
called? The Red Owl. In Bloomington. Thanks so much. The manager,
puzzled, hangs up. Sussman thinks, am I supposed to go to the Red Owl,
to receive a further sign? He goes… In the parking lot of the Red Owl
Sussman, wearing a short-brimmed fedora, emerges from his car. It is an
unremarkable grocery store in a suburban mall. It’s a Red Owl. Inside
Sussman, in his fedora, gazes around. Groceries. What have you. A
service alley behind the store: dumpsters, wind-blown garbage, Sussman
looking. On the wall behind the store, a stain… There is an old, rather
nondescript stain of some liquid splatted against the back wall and long
since dribbled away. . Could be a nun sofit… Or maybe not… The parking
lot again: Sussman gets back in his car.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Staring at the Rabbi. He waits a good beat.
He prompts:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So what did you tell him? The Rabbi seems
surprised by the question. Rabbi Nachtner Sussman?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes! Rabbi Nachtner Is it. . relevant?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well-isn’t that why you’re telling me? Rabbi
Nachtner Mm. Okay. Nachtner says, look.. . We are back in the scene,
narrated by voice-over, of the Rabbi silently advising the fretful
Sussman. . The teeth, we don’t know. A sign from Hashem, don’t know.
Helping others, couldn’t hurt. LARRY’s voice-over question plays over
Sussman asking the same thing: LARRY But is that what it meant?-tet resh
nun lamed nun shin isayin, was it “Help me”? or a number? Or was it
Rabbi Nachtner We can’t know everything. Sussman stares blankly at the
Rabbi. A beat. LARRY It sounds like you don’t know Mthing!</p>
<p><strong>the rabbi</strong>: Smiling equably at LARRY. He reacts to
the ejaculation with a shrug. LARRY scowls.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why even tell me the story? Rabbi
Nachtner</p>
<p>****: First I should tell you, then I shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What happened to Sussman?</p>
<p><strong>sussman</strong>: In his office. Working on different
patients as the Rabbi resumes his voice-over. Rabbi Nachtner What would
happen? Not much. He went back to work. For a while he checked every
patient’s teeth for new messages; didn’t see any; in time, he found he’d
stopped checking. Sussman, at home, chats with his wife over dinner. .
These questions that are bothering you, LARRY-maybe they’re like a
toothache. We feel them for a while, then they go away. Sussman lies in
bed sleeping, smiling, an arm thrown across his wife.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Dissatisfied.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t want it to just go away! I want an
answer! Rabbi Nachtner The answer! Sure! We all want the answer! But
Hashem doesn’t owe us the answer, LARRY. Hashem doesn’t owe us anything.
The obligation runs the other way.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why does he make us feel the questions if
he’s not gonna give us any answers? Rabbi Nachtner smiles at LARRY for a
beat.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And what happened to the goy? Rabbi
Nachtner’s forebearing smile fades into puzzlement. Rabbi Nachtner The
goy? Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>exterior: the synagogue</strong>: The modern synagogue
grafted onto a patch of prairie. An echoing voice rings out:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sy Ableman was a serious man!</p>
<p><strong>rabbi nachtner</strong>: In close-up he gazes around,
weighing the effect of the words just delivered. After a long beat
during which he seeks to establish eye contact with as much of his
audience as possible: Rabbi Nachtner . Sy Ableman was a man devoted to
his community… Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema. He and the
congregation face each other across a casket down at floor level. . to
torah study… LARRY sits among the congregants, his gaze fixed on a point
off.</p>
<p><strong>then:</strong>: . We speak of L’olam ha-ba, the World to
Come. Not heaven. Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife. “L’olam
ha-ba.” What is L’olam ha-ba? Where is L’olam ha-ba? Well: it is not a
geoaraphic place, certainly. Like-Canada. Murmured chuckles from the
congregation. Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav ood’vash-the land flowing
with milk and honey, for we are not promised a personal reward, a gold
star, a first-class VIP lounge where we get milk and cookies to
eternity! More chuckles. L’olam ha-ba… is in the bosom of Abraham.
L’olam ba- ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy Ableman
and to which Sy Ableman now returns. That’s right, he returns. Because
he still inspires us Ableman returns. Because his memory instructs us
Ableman returns. Because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways Sy
Ableman returns. The frivolous man may vanish without a ripple but Sy
Ableman? Sy Ableman was a serious man…</p>
<p><strong>a hand rapping at a door</strong>: The front door to the
Gopnik home. LARRY, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka,
opens the door. He recoils in surprise edged with fear. Reverse: two
uniformed policemen.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Arthur Gopnik? LARRY is momentarily dumb.
Inside the house we can see a corner of a card table set up in the
living room with food laid out on it. SARAH sits with her back to us,
head wrapped by a towel-turban. Arthur, on the far side of the table,
his balding head domed by a yarmul- ka, half-leans out so that he may
sneak looks toward the men at the door without totally revealing
himself. From somewhere down the hall come Judith’s muffled sobs. . Are
you Arthur Gopnik?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m… Laurence Gopnik. Cop I Do you go by the
name Arthur Gopnik?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Is that Arthur Gopnik? Arthur ducks away.
From inside the living room: DANNY Dad? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Can you tell me what’s going on. We’re
sitting shiva here.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: You’re what.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: A religious observance. We’re… bereaved. The
cop standing behind gazes in over his partner’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Who died?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: My wife’s um… it’s a long story.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Look. Tell Gopnik-you know, Arthur
Gopnik-he’s breaking the law. We’re not arresting him now but next time
we will. Gambling is against the law in this state. That’s just the way
it is. All right. Go back to your…</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: A minute later. The family-except for
Judith, whose weeping continues off-sits around the card table. A long
beat. At length:</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad, we get Channel 4 now but not Channel
7.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur, how could you do that to this family.
On Sy’s… on Sy’s-</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: It’s a victimless crime.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That doesn’t make it right! And you-</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He won a lot of money, Dad! The Mentaculus
really works! LARRY’s gaze swings onto his son.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You knew about it?!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, um…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: They must have finked me out. They knew I
could just keep on winning, so a couple weeks ago they blackballed me,
and now they’ve-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What did you do with the money you won?
Silence. Arthur sneaks a look at DANNY. LARRY looks back and forth
between them. . What’s going on? Arthur shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Unfair!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What have you been-</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What’s unfair is these guys saying I can’t
play in their card game!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why give him the money?! You know what he
spends it on?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I know about the records.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Records?! You think he buys records from Mike
Fagle? Movement in DANNY’s body; SARAH recoils from a kick. . Ow! Little
brat!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hey! What’s going on!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: At least I’m not saving up for a nose
job!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Brat!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Nobody in this house is getting a nose job!
You got that?!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ali! Struck by a thought he leaps up and
bolts from the room.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: DANNY! You weren’t excused! We’re still
talking!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What a brat.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What was this card game, Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Some goys run a private game. We hear the TV
go on down the hall and the theme from F Troop. I think they’re
Italians.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: DANNY, what’s going on! He rises.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom</strong>: LARRY enters to look down at DANNY’s back.
Beyond him F Troop flickers on the TV.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: DANNY! We’re sitting Shiva!</p>
<p><strong>don milgram’s office</strong>: LARRY, sitting across from
Don, has his head buried in his arms on the desktop.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: She’s retained Barney Silver at Tuchman, Marsh.
This is a, uh–this is an aggressive firm, LARRY.</p>
<p>****: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: These are not pleasant people. Judith is free
of course to retain whoever she… I take it you don’t talk to her? LARRY
raises his head, squinting against the light.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s hard. I think she emptied our bank
account. I tried to ask her about it, very civilly.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She, uh…</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Yeah, yeah you better open an account in your
name only, put your paychecks in there from here on out. Til we know
where we stand.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Can I?</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Oh, absolutely!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s not, um, dishonest?</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Oh, absolutely! You, uh-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I hate to say this, but I think she’s also
been sneaking cash out of my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Ouch. Well, yes, this is definitely, um,
adversarial. The</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Just a sunburn. I’ve been spending a lot of
time on the roof. For… perspective. He trails off and his head drops
back down onto his arms. Don gives him an appraising look.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: . Have you seen the Rabbi?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Talked to Nachtner.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: You should talk to Minda.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: They told me Minda doesn’t do pastoral work
any more. Just.. . ceremonial.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Mm. Congratulates the bar mitzvah boy every
week, so forth? LARRY nods miserably. . That’s too bad. A very wise man,
Minda. LARRY raises his head.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Getting old.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Very old.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, me.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: LARRY, you’re fine. It’s a bump in the road.
Was Nachtner helpful at all? LARRY gives a helpless shrug. Don rolls his
eyes. . What-did he tell you about the goy’s teeth? A knock on the door.
Don projects: Yeah? The door cracks open. A pipe edges in, followed by a
peeking face: Solomon Schlutz. . Oh, good! Sol, come on in. Solomon
Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders. He has the smooth
impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth. He glides
into the room, a sheaf of files tucked under one arm. . Sol has been
looking into the property-line issues.. . Solomon Schlutz seats himself
at the conference table and starts sorting and arranging the files into
three piles. . It seems that you do have a real problem with the
original survey. But Sol seems to think there’s some kind of nifty way
for us to-well, I haven’t heard it myself, I’ll let Sol map it out.
Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files, his eye occasionally
lingering on a specific page. When at length he is finished he carefully
justifies the edges of the closest pile, takes the pipe out of his
mouth, gives LARRY a smile that seems to take some effort, and then taps
the pipe in a large glass ashtray. He looks up again at LARRY, this time
shocked. His stunned look on LARRY holds for a long beat. LARRY returns
a bewildered look.</p>
<p><strong>syllable:</strong>: Solomon Schlutz Gah! His stare holds. He
reddens.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: .Sol? Solomon Schlutz’s face now passes from
the red end of the spectrum to the purple. Solomon Schlutz Nnnnff! The
pipe clatters out of his hand. The hand grabs at his own shirt front. .
Glufffl… Now his head pitches back. His backflung weight and twisting
body send his chair tipping over, one hand still clutching at his chest
while the other frantically waves. He disappears behind the conference
table and lands with a floor-shaking thump. His writhing and gurgling
remain audible.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Sol! Sol! Don Milgram has risen to look down at
his fallen colleague; now he flings open the conference room door and
bellows into the office: An ambulance! Quick! Somebody call an
ambulance! A</p>
<p><strong>doctor!</strong>: A secretary looks in and screams. Solomon
Schlutz Garf!… Nnlogl…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Call back.</p>
<p><strong>his office</strong>: LARRY sits in heavily behind his desk. A
beat. He opens the top left desk drawer. He withdraws the bulging white
envelope and opens its flap. He runs a finger over the wad of bills.</p>
<p><strong>larry?</strong>: He looks up, startled. Arlen Finkle stands
in the doorway. . As you know, the tenure committee meets-are you all
right? LARRY sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m… fine. Arlen Finkle I’m sorry. I know
you’ve hit a rough patch.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Thank you. I’m fine. He puts the envelope in
the desk drawer and closes it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arlen, I am not an evil man! Arlen looks at
him, shocked. Arlen Finkle LARRY! Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I am not- Arlen Finkle We don’t make moral
judgments!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I went to the Aster Art once. I saw Swedish
Reverie. Arlen Finkle It’s okay, LARRY, we don’t need to know! The
Tenure</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It wasn’t even erotic! Although it was, in a
way. Arlen Finkle It’s all right, LARRY. Believe me. LARRY calms
somewhat.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Okay. Arlen Finkle Okay. Okay. We, uh, we
decide on Wednesday, so if there’s anything you want to submit in
support of your tenure application, we should have it by then. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I haven’t done anything. Arlen Finkle
Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I haven’t published. Arlen Finkle Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Are you still getting those letters? Arlen
Finkle Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Those anonymous- Arlen Finkle Yes, I know.
Yes. A beat. LARRY nods.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. Okay. Wednesday. Arlen Finkle Okay.
Don’t worry. Doing nothing is not bad. Ipso facto.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>classroom</strong>: We are close over LARRY’s shoulder as he
scribbles symbols onto the chalkboard.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . and that means… so that… from which we
derive… His glances back toward the class show that he is wearier,
baggier-eyed, more haggard than ever. There is also something odd about
his posture. He writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before
hitting the right edge of the chalkboard. . and also.. which lets us…
and… Wider as he finishes and straightens up, revealing that he has been
stooping to write across the very bottom of the board. The equation
covers every inch of the classroom-wide three-paneled chalkboard. LARRY
is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame. Reverse on the
class: staring. Okay? LARRY claps chalk dust from his hands. . The
Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can’t ever really know… what’s going
on. A bell sounds. The students start to shake off their stupor and
rise. LARRY projects over the wallah: . So it shouldn’t bother you. Not
being able to figure anything out. Although you will be responsible for
this on the mid-term. The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person
still seated: Sy Ableman. He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, it might be that, in, you know, in
L’olam ha-bah- Sy Ableman Excuse me. Not the issue. In this world,
LARRY. He nods at the chalkboard. . I’ll concede that it’s subtle. It’s
clevva. But at the end of the day, is it convincing?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well-yes it’s convincing. It’s a proof. It’s
mathematics. Sy Ableman Excuse me, LARRY. Mathematics. Is the art of the
possible. LARRY’s brow furrows.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t think so. The art of the possible,
that’s… I can’t remember… something else… Sy Ableman I’m a serious man,
LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I know that. So if I’ve got it wrong, what do
I- Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him. Sy Ableman So simple,
LARRY. See Minda.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I know, I want to see Minda! I want to see
Minda! They told me that oonh! Without our having seen him rise or cross
the room Sy Ableman has body-slammed LARRY into the chalkboard. Now he
grabs LARRY by the hair and whips his head against the equation. As he
slams LARRY’s head, again and again, the chalkboard chatters and the
fringes on Sy’s tallis dance. Sy Ableman See Minda! See Minda! I fucked
your wife, LARRY! I seriously fucked her! That’s what’s going on! See
Minda!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Very close on his eyes as they open. His head
is on a pillow. Dull early light. A hissing sound. LARRY looks blearily
over. On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits
Uncle Arthur’s cyst evacuator. Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked
bathroom door as the machine hisses.</p>
<p><strong>mezuza</strong>: On a doorpost. A hand enters to knock. A
long beat. The person knocking gives up and his footsteps start to go
away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive woman the sunbathing
neighbor, now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white blouse. Her
point-of-view: LARRY, frozen halfway down the stoop, head turned back up
toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Gopnik.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh. Hello, Mrs. Samsky. I knocked, and then
thought you weren’t here. I, uh… Mrs. Samsky’s voice is soft and
breathy: Mrs. Samsky It just took me a second to get to the door. I was
out back. LARRY stands nodding. He seems to need prompting. Mrs. Samsky
does: . Can I help you? Wanna come in?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, I- One hand on the door, she steps back.
Mrs. Samsky It’s cooler.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh. Okay. I just wanted to let you know… He
is entering.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: After the outside glare the house does
indeed seem cooler. LARRY looks around the living room, dim but neat.
Wavering light sifts through closed vertical blinds which drift and
click over floor-vented air-conditioning. Mrs. Samsky closes the door,
shutting out all sound from outside.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’ve noticed that Mr. Samsky isn’t around,
and I- Mrs. Samsky He travels.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh-huh. Yeah, I never seem to see him, so I
thought I should let you know, since you’re somewhat new here, if you
ever have, whatever, chores that you’d, um, or just help with
something-I’ve decided to help others-you know, in a neighborly way… She
gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for the speech to
dribble away to silence. In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the
clicking of the blinds, she is perfectly still. Finally, only her mouth
moves: Mrs. Samsky How thoughtful. LARRY shrugs off the compliment.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh it’s nothing. It’s just good to know your
neighbors. And to help. Help others. Although I don’t care much for my
neighbors on the other side, I must say. Mrs. Samsky lets another
smiling silence pass before responding. Mrs. Samsky . Goys, aren’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Mm. Very much so. Maybe it’s not fair to
judge; I have to admit I- Mrs. Samsky Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh! Um. Okay. Thank you. Mrs. Samsky Iced
tea? I have some. She is already turning to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay.. . He watches her and reacts to: The
backs of her thighs. The flesh retains the broad cross-hatch of her lawn
chair. She disappears into the kitchen, but calls out: Mrs. Samsky I
don’t see you around much, either.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes. Actually I haven’t been home a lot
recently, I, uh, my wife and I are, uh, well, she’s got me staying at
the Jolly Roger, the little motel there on- Mrs. Samsky is reentering
with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded with moisture. The click of the
ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds. Mrs. Samsky You’re in the
doghouse, huh? She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to
him, not invasively close, one bare leg folded onto the couch, the other
draped over it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yeah, that’s an understatement I guess, I
-thank you-I,</p>
<p><strong>uh-</strong>: Mrs. Samsky Do you take advantage of the new
freedoms? LARRY stares at her. Mrs. Samsky gazes back. Her look displays
equanimity; his, not.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . What do you mean. Her look holds for one
more beat and then she swivels and opens the drawer of an end table.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s… Marijuana? Mrs. Samsky Mm-hmm. She
hands the joint over. . You’ll find you’ll need the iced tea. LARRY
handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is it. . well.. . okay…</p>
<p><strong>the vertical blinds</strong>: Some minutes later. They drift
and click in the air blown from the floor vents. LARRY stares at them.
After a long beat:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Maybe Rabbi Scott was right. Mrs. Samsky
Who’s Rabbi Scott?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The junior rabbi. Mrs. Samsky The junior
rabbi.</p>
<p><strong>then:</strong>: . What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He spoke of.. perception. All my problems are
just… just a… a mere.. He trails off, listening. . Is that a siren?
Mrs. Samsky No. Some people get a little paranoid when they… Holy cow…
That is a siren.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: The Samsky’s door opens and LARRY stumbles
out. He stares. The police car has stopped in front of his own house
next door, lights still flashing. Two cops are going up the walk with
Uncle Arthur between them in handcuffs. LARRY, stunned, walks woodenly
toward his house.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hey! Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has
heard. They have rung the doorbell and now disappear inside. LARRY
projects louder-</p>
<p><strong>. hey!</strong>: -and starts to sprint. Mrs. Samsky has
emerged from her house behind. LARRY takes the stoop steps two at a
time. His door stands open and the theme from F</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: This is crazy! This brings the cops’ look
around. Uncle Arthur also turns, shamefaced, to LARRY.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Does this man live here?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I didn’t know what to tell them! They asked
for my address.. .</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s just mathematics! You can’t arrest a man
for mathematics!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I didn’t know whether to say I lived here or
at the Jolly Roger.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You know this man?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I figured this would sound more… I don’t
know… Mrs. Samsky appears behind LARRY on the stoop.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad, why is Uncle Arthur in handcuffs?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s all a mistake. I mean, not a mistake, a,
a-</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Samsky.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: -a miscarriage-</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Does this man live here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He sleeps on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look! What did he do!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Nothing! I didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It folds out. Dad sleeps on a cot.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You can’t just-</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Sir, we picked this man up at the North Dakota.
LARRY is brought up short.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The North Dakota!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: But I didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad, what’s the North Dakota?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Solicitation. Sodomy. Very serious.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . The North Dakota! We hold on LARRY’s
shocked reaction as we hear DANNY, off:</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s Sodomy, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>don milgram</strong>: He wears a black armband. He sits
thinking, bouncing steepled fingers against his nose.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: What does Arthur say?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He says he didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He says. . . he just went in for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Uh-huh. Long beat. . Does Arthur drink?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Uls-huh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . He says he was confused.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well. The North Dakota. Well.
You’ll need a criminal attorney.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. Who’s-</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Ron Meshbesher.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is he good?</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Ron is very good. LARRY’s gaze wanders. He
becomes wistful.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t understand. He goes to mixers at the
Hillel House.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Mm. A beat. . I would call Ron Meshbesher.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is he expensive?</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Ron is not cheap. Don focuses on LARRY.
Cheerful change of subject: . DANNY’s bar mitzvah is… ?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: This week.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: This shabbas! Great! He nods. . It’ll be okay.
Try to relax, LARRY. Try to relax.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. samsky’s bedroom</strong>: LARRY is making strenuous
love to Mrs. Samsky. Mrs. Samsky So good… so good… She rolls on top of
LARRY to straddle him and, still humping, she lights a mentholated
cigarette. LARRY moans.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh my God, Mrs. Samsky… Beyond her head LARRY
can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling of the bedroom. Outside we can
hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn. Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and
the front door opening. LARRY panics. He hisses: . Who is it? Footsteps
are approaching along the hall. Mrs. Samsky doesn’t react; she looks
calmly down at LARRY even as the bedroom door opens behind her and CLIVE
Park walks in wearing a traffic mask. LARRY is mortified: CLIVE, please!
Wait outside! Mrs. Samsky blows smoke into LARRY’s eyes. The screen goes
black. Close on LARRY as he opens his eyes. A shadow falls across his
face. His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place
over his head. The bang of hammer on nailhead. In the black:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He stands looking down in low shot. Above him
is cheap Johnson-Armstrong dropped ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Please. I need help. I’ve already talked to
the other rabbis. Please. Reverse shows an elderly eastern European
woman seated behind a desk, looking up at</p>
<p><strong>larry.</strong>: . I won’t take much of his time. I need
help. I need Minda. It’s not about DANNY’s bar mitzvah. My boy DANNY.
This coming shabbas. Very joyous event. That’s all fine. It’s, it’s more
about myself, I’ve… I’ve had quite a bit of tsuris lately. Marital
problems. Professional. You name it. This is not a frivolous request.
This is a serious- I’m a serious-I’m, uh, I’ve tried to be a serious
man. You</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: The rabbi is busy.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He didn’t look busy! As she starts shuffling
papers:</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He’s thinking.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur… ? Arthur? Arthur is a dim mound on
the next bed. His weeping continues. For no reason LARRY continues to
keep his voice to a whisper: . Arthur. What’s wrong? No answer. .
Arthur. It’ll be okay. Arthur. We’ll get Ron Meshbesher. It’ll be
okay-</p>
<p><strong>aaahhhh!</strong>: Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to
interpret. Arthur flings off his bedclothes. He leaps from the bed and
runs to the door. In boxer shorts and undershirt he flings the door open
and runs out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur! LARRY leaps from his bed, also in his
underwear. He goes to the door but pauses, peering cautiously outside.
Satisfied that the courtyard is deserted, he plunges into it.</p>
<p><strong>courtyard</strong>: The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by
ghastly mercury vapor lights. The pool, surrounded by chain-link fence,
has been drained. Its white concrete interior is cracked</p>
<p>****: Arthur! He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur.
. You’ve got to pull yourself together! Arthur is suddenly angry. His
voice bounces off the concrete:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: It’s all shit, LARRY! It’s all shit!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur. Don’t use that word.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: It’s all fucking shit!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Look at everything Hashem has given you! And
what do I get! I get fucking shit!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur. What do I have. I live at the Jolly
Roger.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You’ve got a family. You’ve got a job.
Hashem hasn’t given me bupkes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur.
Please. Sometimes -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your-
self.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur. Please.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Hashem hasn’t given me shit. Now I can’t
even play cards. He starts weeping again. LARRY looks around.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur. This isn’t the right forum. Please.
Not by the pool. Arthur weeps. Arthur… It’s okay… It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>morning</strong>: LARRY and Arthur are driving. We are
looking at the two of them square through a windshield in which towering
conifers stream by in reflection. It seems to be a glorious day.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is this it? Both men peer out.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I think so… yeah… there… He indicates the
road ahead.</p>
<p><strong>a signpost</strong>: The old-fashioned kind with wooden
fingers pointing the different directions. One points toward CANADA.</p>
<p><strong>boundary waters</strong>: Beautiful, wooded, remote. The car
is parked at water’s edge, having backed down a lane of two tracks worn
through the undergrowth. LARRY and Arthur are lowering the canoe into
water.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay.. . He straightens. Arthur straightens.
LARRY hugs him. .Look… They separate and LARRY pulls a white envelope
from his pocket and gives it to Arthur. . This’ll help you get back on
your feet. Arthur looks into the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh my God. Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Doesn’t matter. When you-</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: This is a lot of money!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It should get you started.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: This is a lot of money! Are you sure you
don’t need it?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Arthur, I’m fine. Come on, get in. When
you’re settled…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Are you sure this is okay?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s fine. It’s fine… LARRY waves. Arthur
waves bravely back, then turns to pick up the oars. A couple of strokes
and he turns back again with a last thought. He calls:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: LARRY. I’m sorry. What I said last
night.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I know. It’s okay. A lingering look from
Arthur, and then he turns back to row. A gunshot. Blood spurts from the
back of Uncle Arthur’s neck. He slumps forward, dead.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Good shot! LARRY looks wildly around. He
sees: Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues, hard to pick out in
the foliage. They are looking off toward the canoe, Mitch just lowering
his rifle. Gar Brandt’s look swings around, into the lens. He points at
us: There’s another Jew, son.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Gasping awake in the motel room. He looks
around. It is dawn. Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear,
staring off into space, slackjawed, vacant-eyed, drained. LARRY gazes
around the room, waiting for things to fall into place. Finally,
blearily:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Were we… out at the pool last night? Arthur,
still staring off, responds in a flat, empty voice:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes. I’m sorry. LARRY blinks sleep away.
After a beat:</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s shabbas. Another beat. Arthur heaves a
deep sigh.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’ll go drain my cyst.</p>
<p><strong>restroom</strong>: Day. A two-urinal, two-stall men’s room of
old tile and yellowed fixtures. We are low. One of the stall doors is
closed. Under it we see the dress shoes and dress pants of two young men
standing inside. We hear a long sucking inhale. Ronnie Nudell’s Voice
Gimme that fucker. A loudly projected echoing male voice:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ya’amod hab’rayshit.</p>
<p><strong>sanctuary</strong>: DANNY, seated in the second pew next to
his parents and sister and Uncle Arthur, rises and shuffles along the
row to the aisle. His eyes are wide and red-rimmed. The prelapped voice
was his call to the torah. All eyes in the congregation, which fills the
large sanctuary, are on him. In great echoing silence he walks to the
steps on the right side of the bema and climbs. The right-side lectern
is surrounded by a gaggle of old Jewish men. They busy themselves with
the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the lectern, rolling them,
pausing, rolling some more, muttering prayers, kissing the scrolls by
means of their tsitsim. They pay DANNY no attention. DANNY takes his
place centered behind the lectern. His chin comes up to the bottom of
the reading platform. Men continue to mutter prayers around him. A pair
of hands appear on his shoulders from behind. DANNY looks down at the
strange hands. They pull him back. A foot drags a small riser out from
under the lectern. Hands push DANNY up onto the riser.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel
effashot… DANNY is still staring at the end of the yad against the
parchment scroll. Someone’s hand enters and moves the yad to a different
place in the text. The voice repeats: . Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh
gamor shel effashot… DANNY looks up from the scrolls. In the
congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and squished between
his parents. He returns DANNY’s red-rimmed slack-jawed stare. The
insistent voice: . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot…
DANNY looks over. From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him.
He looks somewhat like Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel
effashot. .</p>
<p><strong>prompter</strong>: Mm-hm. DANNY continues to boom out the
torah portion. He moves the yad along the line of letters. In the
congregation, LARRY and Judith watch. We hear DANNY chanting fluently
and LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm. Juith
whispers:</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: I’m sorry that… things have been so hard for
us…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Sy had so much respect for you, LARRY. He
pats her hand. A beat. . He wrote letters to the tenure committee.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: The congregation is loudly singing V’Zos
Hatorah. A tallised man of late middle age</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Jesus Christ.. .</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: DANNY stands behind the left lectern facing
Rabbi Nachtner who holds a small kiddush cup out to him. Although Rabbi
Nachtner seems to be addressing DANNY, he is projecting loudly.</p>
<p><strong>nachtner</strong>: . taking your place as a member of our
tribe. You will go and see Rabbi Minda after the service. You will cele-
brate in a reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall. And then you will be
a member of B’Nai Abraham and of the Nation of Israel. DANNY Gopnik, the
Sisterhood makes a gift to you of this kiddush cup so that you will
remember this blessed day on the next shabbas and the next, and on every
shabbas of a long and fruitful life, and, until that wonderful day when
you stand under the chupa, we say.. .</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Amen. DANNY, still red-eyed, tries to
focus. His point-of-view shows the kiddush cup large in the foreground,
extended toward him by the Rabbi beaming above. His own hand rises into
frame to grasp the kiddush cup. The congregation starts Adon Olam.</p>
<p><strong>a door</strong>: Creaking open. The cut has snapped off the
robust Adon Olam, leaving sepulchral quiet. DANNY, clutching his kiddush
cup, hesitantly enters the dim study. Minda’s elderly eastern European
gatekeeper closes the door behind him. Minda is an old man staring at
him from behind a bare desktop. His look, eyes magnified by thick
glasses, is impossible to read. DANNY creeps to the chair facing the
desk. He gingerly sits on the squeaking leather upholstery,
self-conscious under Minda’s stare. Minda breathes regularly through his
mouth. It is the only sound in the room. A long beat. The two sit face
to face. Minda smacks his lips a couple of times, preparing to speak.
Another beat.</p>
<p><strong>minda</strong>: When the truth is found. To be lies. He
pauses. He clears his throat. At length: . And all the hope. Within you
dies. Another beat. DANNY waits. Minda stares. He smacks his lips again.
. Then what? DANNY doesn’t answer. It is unclear whether the question
was directed at him. Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>larry’s office</strong>: LARRY is at his desk sorting through
mail. Arlen Finkle DANNY was magnificent. LARRY looks up: Arlen is
leaning in his accustomed spot in the office doorway.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh. Thank you, Arlen. Arlen Finkle Mazel tov.
It was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes it was. Thank you. Arlen Finkle Such a
time of nachas, LARRY. He’s your youngest. You have to savor it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I do. I will. Arlen Finkle See you at the
staff caf.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes. Arlen shoves off to go, but hesitates.
Arlen Finkle I just… I shouldn’t tell you. I’m not telling you
officially. The tenure candidates aren’t notified til Monday.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Yes? Arlen nods. Arlen Finkle You’ll be
very pleased. LARRY stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Thank you, Arlen. Over his back as he goes:
Arlen Finkle I didn’t say anything. Mazel tov.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school corridor</strong>: Distant thunder at the cut.
We are tracking behind Minda’s female Caliban as she walks down the
hall, stooped and shuffling. She holds a stack of papers in one
hand.</p>
<p><strong>agreement.</strong>: Underneath is an invoice. The amount:
$3,000. Arriving rain begins to patter at the window.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school class</strong>: The TEACHER, Mar King, leads
the class in drill. DANNY has a book tilted towards him on his desktop.
It hides his radio. The door opens and the elderly woman shuffles to Mar
King’s desk. She hands him a paper from off her stack of copies. Mar
King puts on reading glasses and inspects it. As he reads thunder
crashes, closer.</p>
<p><strong>larry’s office</strong>: He fingers the invoice. Close on a
printed detail: PAYABLE: and, typed underneath: Upon Receipt. Wind is
whipping rain hard against the window.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew school class</strong>: Mar King taps on the desktop
for attention. Mar King Chaverim, there’s a tornado warning from the
weather service. Rabbi Minda has decided to move us over to the basement
of the shul. Hubbub in the classrooom.</p>
<p><strong>larry’s office</strong>: He is staring down at his desktop.
Thunder. He reaches up and scratches his nose as he stares at his desk.
On the desk: a ledger sheet with a list of students’ names. Next to each
name, a grade. LARRY drums his fingers. He picks up a pencil. He goes
down to PARK, CLIVE. Next to it is an F. He waggles the pencil,
eraser-end thumping the sheet. He erases the F. He enters a C. The
pencil leaves frame. We hold for a beat on the new grade. The hand
reenters. It puts a minus sign after the C. The hand withdraws. LARRY
closes the file. Just as he does so: The phone jangles, very harsh.
LARRY looks at it, frozen. He lets it ring a couple times. He reaches
for it. He slowly picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Hello?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . Yes?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hi, Len Shapiro.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh. Hello Dr. Shapiro. Dr. Shapiro Listen,
mazel tov on DANNY.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes, thank you. Dr. Shapiro Listen, could you
come in to discuss these X-ray results? LARRY sits frozen, phone to his
ear. . Hello?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes? Dr. Shapiro LARRY, could you come in and
discuss these X-ray results? Remember the X-rays we took?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: . We can’t discuss them on the phone?
Thunder. Pattering rain.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: When? Dr. Shapiro Now. Now is good. I’ve
cleared some time now.</p>
<p><strong>talmud torah parking lot</strong>: The students mill about.
It is overcast dark, and extremely windy. Someone is fumbling with keys
at the shul. DANNY still has his radio with the earpiece in. Everyone’s
clothing flaps. Ronnie Nudell shouts above the wind: Ronnie Nudell That
fucking flag is gonna rip right off the flagpole!</p>
<p><strong>car</strong>: We are looking through a windshield lashed by
rain at LARRY, driving. His hands are clenched tight on the wheel.
Wipers pump to keep up with the rain. The cars behind have their lights
on. It has gotten quite dark. Passing streetlights rhythmically sweep
LARRY’s face, their light stippled and bent by the rain on the
windows.</p>
<p><strong>talmud torah parking lot</strong>: DANNY is looking across
the lot in which orange school busses are parked. His head bobs in time
to the music. His hair whips in the wind. A building roar, very
deep.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey! Fagle! From behind DANNY, over his
shoulder: we see a funnel cloud in the middle distance. A growing
rumble. The tornado is approaching. At the first downbeat of its chorus
the Jefferson Airplane song bumps up full.</p>
