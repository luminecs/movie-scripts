<p><strong>waitress</strong>: When you be back?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Couple a weeks. Don’t do nothin’ you
wouldn’t want me to hear about!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How about a lift, mister?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Can’t you see that sticker?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure I see it. But a good guy don’t pay no
attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Scrunch down on the running board till we
get around the bend.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Goin’ far?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just a few miles. I’d a walked her if my dogs
wasn’t pooped out.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Lookin’ for a job?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He’s a
sharecropper, but we been there a long time.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Been doin’ a job?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick
or a sledge–that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that
all the time. Got a trade?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why don’t you get to it, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Get to what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You know what I mean. You been givin’ me a
goin’ over ever since I got in. Whyn’t you go on and ask me where I
been?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I don’t stick my nose in nobody’s
business.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Naw–not much!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I stay in my own yard.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Listen. That big nose of yours been goin’ over
me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain’t keepin’ it a secret. I
been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You ain’t got to get sore.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I didn’t mean nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Me neither. I’m just tryin’ to get along
without shovin’ anybody around, that’s all. See that road up ahead?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s where I get off.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You’re about to bust to know what I done, ain’t
you? Well, I ain’t a guy to let you down. Homicide!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I never asked you!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure, but you’d a throwed a fit if I hadn’t
tol’ you.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Mmmmm he’s my saviour. Mmmmm my saviour,
Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now. Howdy, friend.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Say, ain’t you young Tom Joad–ol’ Tom’s
boy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah. On my way home now.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Well, I do declare! I baptized you, son.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why, you’re the preacher!</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Used to be. Not no more. I lost the call. But
boy, I sure used to have it! I’d get an irrigation ditch so squirmin’
full of repented sinners I pretty near drowned half of ’em! But not no
more. I lost the sperit.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Pa always said you was never cut out to be a
preacher.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I got nothin’ to preach about no more–that’s
all. I ain’t so sure o’ things.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: At my meetin’s I used to get the girls
glory-shoutin’ till they about passed out. Then, I’d go to comfort
‘em–and always end up by lovin’ ‘em. I’d feel bad, an’ pray, an’ pray,
but it didn’t do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just
wasn’t no hope for me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I never let one go by me when I could catch
her.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: But you wasn’t a preacher. A girl was just a
girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin’ their souls.
I ast myself–what is this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe that’s love. Why,
I love everybody so much I’m fit to bust sometimes! So maybe there ain’t
no sin an’ there ain’t no virtue. There’s just what people do. Some
things folks do is nice, and some ain’t so nice. But that’s as far as
any man’s got a right to say.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: figuring there is no percentage in continuing
this philosophical discussion, pulls out a flask, which</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Course I’ll say grace if somebody sets out the
food– –but my heart ain’t in it. Nice drinkin’ liquor.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ought to be. That’s fact’ry liquor. Cost me a
buck.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Been out travelin’ around?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Didn’t you hear? It was in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: No, I never. What?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I been in the penitentiary for four years.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Excuse me for asking.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t mind any more. I’d do what I done
again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and
I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: And you ain’t ashamed?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He had a knife in me. That’s why they only gave
me seven years. Got out in four–parole.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Ain’t you seen your folks since then?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin’ kind
of excited about it, too. Which way you going?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: It don’t matter. Ever since I lost the sperit
it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other. I’ll go your
way.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maybe Ma’ll have pork for supper. I ain’t had
pork but four times in four years–every Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I’ll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen
him was at a baptizin’, an’ he had one a the bigges’ doses of the Holy
Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin’ over bushes, howlin’ like a
dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin’ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana
an’ he let out a squawk an’ took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he
cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin’
dentist there and he set her, an’ I give her a prayin’ over, but they
wasn’t no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Lissen. This wind’s fixin’t to do somepin’!</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Shore it is. It always is, this time a
year.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Is it fur?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just around that next bend.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Your granma was a great one, too. The third
time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a
full-growed deacon with her fist.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s our place.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: And it ain’t any too close, either! We better
run!</p>
<p><strong>tom’s voice</strong>: Ma?… Pa?… Ain’t nobody here? Somepin’s
happened.</p>
<p><strong>casy’s voice</strong>: You got a match?</p>
<p><strong>tom’s voice</strong>: There was some pieces of candle always
on a shelf.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They’re all gone–or dead.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: They never wrote you nothing?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No. They wasn’t people to write.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This was Ma’s. Had ’em for years.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when
I went away. You reckon they could be dead?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I never heard nothin’ about it.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Muley! Where’s my folks, Muley?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: They gone.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I know that! But where they gone?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This is Muley Graves. You remember the
preacher, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I ain’t no preacher anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: All right, you remember the man then.</p>
<p><strong>muley and casy</strong>: Glad to see you again. Glad to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Now where is my folks?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Gone– –over to your Uncle John’s. The whole
crowd of ’em, two weeks ago. But they can’t stay there either, because
John’s got his notice to get off.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: But what’s happened? How come they got to get
off? We been here fifty years–same place.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Ever’body got to get off. Ever’body leavin’,
goin’ to California. My folks, your folks, ever’body’s folks. Ever’body
but me. I ain’t gettin’ off.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: But who done it?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Listen! That’s some of what done it–the
dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin’ like this, year after year–blowin’
the land away, blowin’ the crops away, blowin’ us away now.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Some say I am. You want to hear what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s what I asked you, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: The way it happens–the way it happened to
me–the man come one day…</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them
dusters done to the land, the tenant system don’t work no more. It don’t
even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can
handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and
take all the crop.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: But we couldn’t do on any less’n what our
share is now. The chillun ain’t gettin’ enough to eat as it is, and
they’re so ragged we’d be shamed if ever’body else’s chillun wasn’t the
same way.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: I can’t help that. All I know is I got my
orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that’s what I’m
telling you.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: You mean get off my own land?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Now don’t go blaming me. It ain’t my
fault.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Whose fault is it?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: You know who owns the land–the Shawnee Land
and Cattle Company.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Who’s the Shawnee Land and Cattle
Comp’ny?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: It ain’t nobody. It’s a company.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: They got a pres’dent, ain’t they? They got
somebody that knows what a shotgun’s for, ain’t they?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: But it ain’t his fault, because the bank
tells him what to do.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: All right. Where’s the bank?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Tulsa. But what’s the use of picking on
him? He ain’t anything but the manager, and half crazy hisself, trying
to keep up with his orders from the east!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Then who do we shoot?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Brother, I don’t know. If I did I’d tell
you. But I just don’t know who’s to blame!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Well, I’m right here to tell you, mister,
ain’t nobody going to push me off my land! Grampa took up this land
seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was all born on it, and some
of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that’s what makes it
ourn–bein’ born on it, and workin’ it, and dyin’ on it–and not no piece
of paper with writin’ on it! So just come on and try to push me off!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: They come. They come and pushed me off.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: They come with the cats.</p>
<p><strong>tom’s voice</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: The cats–the caterpillar tractors.</p>
<p><strong>muley’s voice</strong>: And for ever’ one of ’em ten-fifteen
families gets throwed outa their homes–one hundred folks with no place
to live but on the road. The Rances, the Perrys, the Peterses, the
Joadses–one after another they got throwed out. Half the folks you and
me know–throwed right out into the road. The one that got me come a
month ago.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: You come any closer and I’m gonna blow you
right outa that cat!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: I tol’ you!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Why, you’re Joe Davis’s boy!</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: I don’t like nobody drawin’ a bead on me.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Then what are you doin’ this kind a thing
for–against your own people?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: For three dollars a day, that’s what I’m
doin’ it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife’s mother.
Them people got to eat. Fust and on’y thing I got to think about is my
own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: But this is my land, son. Don’t you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Used to be your land. B’longs to the comp’ny
now.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What’s he fixin’ to do, ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Hush!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Have it your own way, son, but just as sure
as you touch my house with that cat I’m gonna blow you plumb to kingdom
come.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: You ain’t gonna blow nobody nowhere. First
place, you’d get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn’t be two
days before they’d have another guy here to take my place.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Don’t! Please don’t!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: I’m tellin’ you!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: What was the use. He was right. There wasn’t
a thing in the world I could do about it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: But it don’t seem possible–kicked off like
that!</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: The rest of my fambly set out for the
west–there wasn’t nothin’ to eat–but I couldn’t leave. Somepin’ wouldn’t
let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell
myself I was lookin’ out for things, so when they come back ever’thing
would be all right. But I knowed that wan’t true. There ain’t nothin’ to
look out for. And ain’t nobody comin’ back. They’re gone– and me, I’m
just an ’ol graveyard ghost–that’s all in the world I am.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: You think I’m touched.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: No. You’re lonely–but you ain’t touched.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: It don’t matter. If I’m touched, I’m touched,
and that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What I can’t understand is my folks takin’ it!
Like ma! I seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken.
She aimed to go for him with an ax she had in the other hand but she got
mixed up and forgot which hand was which and when she got through with
that peddler all she had left was two chicken legs.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Just a plain ’ol graveyard ghost, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s settlin’.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: What you figger to do?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s hard to say. Stay here till mornin’ an’
then go on over to Uncle John’s, I reckon. After that I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: Listen! That’s them! Them lights! Come on, we
got to hide out!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hide out for what? We ain’t doin’ nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: You’re trespassin’! It ain’t you lan’ no
more! An’ that’s the supr’tendant–with a gun!</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Come on, Tom. You’re on parole.</p>
<p><strong>a part of the cotton field</strong>: Muley leads the way.</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: All you got to do is lay down an’ watch.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Won’t they come out here?</p>
<p><strong>muley</strong>: I don’t think so. One come out here once an’
I clipped him from behin’ with a fence stake. They ain’t bothered
since.</p>
<p><strong>the exterior of the cabin</strong>: The car stops. A strong
searchlight flashes on and goes over the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Muley? He ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Anybody ever ‘tol me I’d be hidin’ out on my
own place…!</p>
<p><strong>ma’s voice</strong>: Lord, make us thankful for what we are
about to receive, for His sake. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I seen you!–You et durin’ grace!</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: One little ole dab!–one teeny little ole
dab!</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Ain’t he messy though!</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I seen him!–gobblin’ away like an ole
pig!</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Whyn’t you keep your eyes shet durin’ grace,
you ole…</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: What’s it say again?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Says plenty work in California– peaches. Eight
hundred pickers needed.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Wait’ll I get to California! Gonna reach up
and pick me an orange whenever I want it! Or grapes. That there’s
somethin’ I ain’t never had enough of! Gonna get me a whole bunch a
grapes off a bush and I’m gonna squash ’em all over my face and just let
the juice dreen down offen my chin!</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Maybe I get me a whole washtub fulla them
grapes and jest sit in ’em and scrooge around till they was gone! I
shore would like to do that!</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Look. I’m Grampa!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Thank God. Oh thank God. Tommy, you didn’t bust
out, didya? You ain’t got to hide, have you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, Ma. I’m paroled. I got my papers.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I was so scared we was goin’ away without
you–and we’d never see each other again.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’d a found you, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Muley tol’ me what happened, Ma. Are we goin’
to California true?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: We got to, Tommy. But that’s gonna be awright. I
seen the han’bills, about how much work they is, an’ high wages, too.
But I gotta fin’ out somepin’ else first, Tommy. Did they hurt you, son?
Did they hurt you an’ make you mean-mad?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Mad, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Sometimes they do.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, Ma I was at first–but not no more.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Sometimes they do somethin’ to you, Tommy. They
hurt you–and you get mad–and then you get mean–and they hurt you
again–and you get meaner, and meaner–till you ain’t no boy or no man any
more, but just a walkin’ chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that,
Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, Ma. You don’t have to worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Thank God. I–I don’t want no mean son</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: It’s Tommy! It’s Tommy back! What’d you do,
son–bust out?</p>
<p><strong>winfield and ruthie</strong>: Tom’s outa ja-ul! Tom’s outa
ja-ul!</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: I knowed it! Couldn’t keep him in! Can’t
keep a Joad in! I knowed it from the fust!</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: You know what I al’ays said: “Tom’ll come
bustin’ outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence.” Can’t keep
no Joad in jail!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I didn’t bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah.
Howya, Uncle John.</p>
<p><strong>noah and john</strong>: Fine, Tommy. Glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: I was the same way myself. Put me in jail
and I’d bust right out. Couldn’t hold me!</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Bust out?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Parole.</p>
<p><strong>al and rosasharn</strong>: Hi, Tom! Howya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Rosasharn! Hi, Rosasharn! Howya, Al!</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: The jailbird’s back! The jailbird’s
back!</p>
<p><strong>omnes</strong>: Hi, Ma! Hi, Connie! Hiya, Grampa!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: That’s Connie Rivers with her. They’re married
now. She’s due about three-four months.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why, she wasn’t no more’n a kid when I went
up.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You bust outa jail, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Naw. They paroled me.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Heh’o Tom. This is Connie, my
husband.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: If this don’t beat all! Well, I see you been
busy already!</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: You do not see either!–not yet!</p>
<p><strong>omnes</strong>: Lookut his face! Y’see his face? Lookut
Rosasharn! Y’ever see anything like her face when Tom said it? Look
around, Rosasharn! Let’s see it again!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, Joad! John Joad!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Ain’t forgot, have you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We ain’t forgot.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Comin’ through here tomorrow, you know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know. We be out. We be out by sunup.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How you get all this money?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Sol’ things, chopped cotton–even Grampa. Got us
about two hunnerd dollars all tol’. Shucked out seventy- five for this
truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I
figger we oughta be able to make it on that.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Easy. After all, they ain’t but about twelve of
us, is they?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: She’ll prob’ly ride like a bull calf– but she’ll
ride!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Reckon we better begin roustin’ ‘em out if we
aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys
comin’?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How about it, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. We’re
fixin’ to leave.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Where’s Grampa? Al, go git him.</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I’m gonna sit up front! Somebody he’p
me!</p>
<p><strong>ruthie and winfield</strong>: Goin’ to California! Goin’ to
California!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: You kids climb up first, on top. Al’s gonna
drive, Ma. You sit up there with him and Granma and we’ll swap around
later.</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I ain’t gonna sit with Grampa!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Connie, you he’p Rosasharn up there alongside
Ruthie and Winfiel’. Where’s Grampa?</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: Where he al’ays is, prob’ly!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Well, leave him a place, but Noah, you and John,
y’all kinda find yourself a place–kinda keep it even all around.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Think she’ll hold?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: If she does it’ll be a miracle outa
Scripture.</p>
<p><strong>grampa’s voice</strong>: Lemmo go, gol dang it! Lemmo go, I
tell you!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: He wasn’t sleepin’. He was settin’ out back a
the barn. They’s somepin’ wrong with him.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Ef you don’t let me go–</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s the matter, Grampa?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Ain’t nothin’ the matter. I just ain’t
a-goin’, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: What you mean you ain’t goin’? We got to go. We
got no place to stay.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: I ain’t talkin’ about you, I’m talkin’ about
me. And I’m a-stayin’. I give her a good goin’ over all night long– and
I’m a-stayin’.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: But you can’t do that, Grampa. This here land is
goin’ under the tractor. We all got to git out.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: All but me! I’m a-stayin’.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How ’bout Granma?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Take her with you!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: But who’d cook for you? How’d you live?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Muley’s livin’, ain’t he? And I’m twicet the
man Muley is!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: And I ain’t gonna listen either. I tol’ you
what I’m gonna do. And I don’t give a hoot in a hollow if they’s oranges
and grapes crowdin’ a fella outa bed even, I ain’t a- goin’ to
California! This here’s my country. I b’long here. It ain’t no good–
–but it’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ma. Pa. Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and
frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: And can’t nobody make me go, either! Ain’t
nobody here man enough to make me! I’m a-stayin’.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Either we got to tie him up and throw him on
the truck, or somepin. He can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Can’t tie him. Either we’ll hurt him or he’ll
git so mad he’ll hurt his self. Reckon we could git him drunk?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ain’t no whisky, is they?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Wait. There’s a half a bottle a soothin’ sirup
here. It put the chillun to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t taste bad.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: And they’s some coffee here. I could fix him a
cup…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s right. And douse some in it.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Better give him a good ’un. He’s awful
bull-headed.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: If Muley can scrabble along, I can do it
too. I smell spareribs. Somebody been eatin’ spareribs? How come I ain’t
got some?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Got some saved for you, Grampa. Got ‘em warmin’
now. Here’s a cuppa coffee.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Awright, but get me some a them spareribs,
too. Get me a whole mess of ’em. I’m hongry.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: I shore do like spareribs.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Easy, easy! You wanta bust his head wide open?
Pull his arms, John.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Ain’t a-goin’, thas all…</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Put somepin’ over him, so he won’t git
sun-struck. Ever’body set now? Awright, Al, letta go!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: You be awright, Grampa.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Good-by, an’ good luck.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Hey, wait! Hold ‘er, Al! Ain’t you goin’ with
us?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I’d like to. There’s somethin’ happenin’ out
there in the wes’ an’ I’d like to try to learn what it is. If you feel
you got the room…</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Come on, get on, plenty room!</p>
<p><strong>omnes</strong>: Sure, come on, Casy, plenty room!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: California, here we come!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Ain’t you gonna look back, Ma?–give the ol’
place a last look?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: We’re goin’ to California, ain’t we? Awright
then, let’s go to California.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: That don’t sound like you, Ma. You never was
like that before.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I never had my house pushed over before. I never
had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose… ever’thing I
had in life.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Ain’t a-goin’… ain’t a-goin’…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: ’S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar’d,
that’s all. Somebody fix a pallet.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Thas it, jus’ tar’d thas all… jus’
tar’d…</p>
<p><strong>tom’s voice</strong>: This here is William James Joad, dyed
of a stroke, old old man. His folkes bured him becaws they got no money
to pay for funerls. Nobody kilt him. Jus a stroke an he dyed.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I figger best we leave something like this on
him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt. Lotta times
looks like the gov’ment got more interest in a dead man than a live
one.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Not be so lonesome, either, knowin’ his name is
there with ‘im, not just’ a old fella lonesome underground.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Casy, won’t you say a few words?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I ain’t no more a preacher, you know.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We know. But ain’t none of our folks ever been
buried without a few words.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I’ll say ‘em–an’ make it short. This here ol’
man jus’ lived a life an’ jus’ died out of it. I don’t know whether he
was good or bad, an’ it don’t matter much. Heard a fella say a poem
once, an’ he says, “All that lives is holy.” But I wouldn’t pray for
jus’ a ol’ man that’s dead, because he’s awright. If I was to pray I’d
pray for the folks that’s alive an’ don’t know which way to turn. Grampa
here, he ain’t got no more trouble like that. He’s got his job all cut
out for ’im–so cover ’im up and let ’im get to it.</p>
<p><strong>omnes</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What is it, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Wasn’t that the state line we just passed?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes’m, that was it.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Your pa tol’ me you didn’t ought to cross it if
you’re paroled. Says they’ll send you up again.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as
I keep outa trouble, ain’t nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is
keep my nose clean.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Maybe they got crimes in California we don’t
know about. Crimes we don’t even know is crimes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Forget it, Ma. Jus’ think about the nice things
out there. Think about them grapes and oranges–an’ ever’body got
work–</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I gotta git out!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: First gas station, Granma–</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I gotta git out, I tell ya! I gotta git
out!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Awright! Awright!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They shore don’t waste no time! Take her
out.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Save your strength, lady. Get goin’, buddy. No
campin’ here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We ain’t campin’. We jus’ stoppin’ a
minute–</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lissen, I heard that before–</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I tell ya I gotta git out!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s kinda ol’–</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: I tell ya–</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay, okay!</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Ma… all this, will it hurt the baby?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Now don’t you go gettin’ nimsy-mimsy.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Sometimes I’m all jumpy inside.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Well, can’t nobody get through nine months
without sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: But will it–hurt the baby?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: They use’ to be a sayin’: A chile born outa
sorrow’ll be a happy chile. An’ another: Born outa too much joy’ll be a
doleful boy. That’s the way I always heard it.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: You don’t ever get scairt, do you,
Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Sometimes. A little. Only it ain’t scairt so
much. It’s just waitin’ an’ wonderin’. But when sump’n happens that I
got to do sump’n– –I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Don’t it ever scare you it won’t be nice
in California like we think?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: No. No, it don’t. I can’t do that. I can’t let
m’self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They’d
all get upset if I done anymore ‘n that. They all depen’ on me jus’
thinkin’ about that. That’s my part–that an’ keepin’ the fambly
together.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Thas my son-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Sings real nice. What state y’all
from?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Oklahoma. Had us a farm there, share-
croppin’.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Till the tractors druv us out.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: We from Arkansas. I had me a store there,
kind of general notions store, but when the farms went the store went
too. Nice a little as you ever saw. I shore did hate to give it up.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Wal, y’cain’t tell. I figure when we git out
there an’ git work an’ maybe git us a piece a growin’ lan’ near water it
might not be so bad at that.</p>
<p><strong>other men</strong>: Thas right… Payin’ good wages, I hear…
Ever’body got work out there… Can’t be no worse…</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: You folks must have a pot a money.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: No, we ain’t got no money. But they’s plenty of
us to work, an’ we ‘re all good men. Get good wages out there an’ put it
all together an’ we’ll be awright.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Good wages, eh! Pickin’ oranges an’
peaches?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: We gonna take whatever they got.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s so funny about it?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: What’s so funny about it? I just been
out there! I been an’ seen it! An’ I’m goin’ back to starve– because I
ruther starve all over at once!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Whatta you think you’re talkin’ about? I got a
han’bill here says good wages, an’ I seen it in the papers they need
pickers!</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Awright, go on! Ain’t nobody stoppin’
ya!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: But what about this?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: I ain’t gonna fret you. Go on!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Wait a minute, buddy. You jus’ done some
jackassin’! You ain’t gonna shut up now. The han’bill says they need
men. You laugh an’ say they don’t. Now which one’s a liar?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: How many you’all got them han’bills?
Come on, how many?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: But what does that prove?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Look at ‘em! Same yella han’bill– 800
pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a
them han’bills an’ maybe 20,000 people sees ‘em. An’ maybe two-three
thousan’ starts movin, wes’ account a this han’bill. Two- three thousan’
folks that’s crazy with worry headin’ out for 800 jobs! Does that make
sense?</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: What are you, a troublemaker? You sure
you ain’t one a them labor fakes?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: I swear I ain’t, mister!</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Well, don’t you go roun’ here tryin’ to
stir up trouble.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: I tried to tell you folks sump’n it took
me a year to fin’ out. Took two kids dead, took my wife dead, to show
me. But nobody couldn’t tell me neither. I can’t tell ya about them
little fellas layin’ in the tent with their bellies puffed out an’ jus’
skin on their bones, an’ shiverin’ an’ whinin’ like pups, an’ me runnin’
aroun’ tryin’ to get work– –not for money, not for wages–jus’ for a cup
a flour an’ a spoon a lard! An’ then the coroner came. “Them children
died a heart-failure,” he says, an’ put it in his paper.
Heart-failure!–an’ their little bellies stuck out like a
pig-bladder!</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Well–gettin’ late. Got to get to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: S’pose he’s tellin’ the truth–that fella?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: He’s tellin’ the truth awright. The truth for
him. He wasn’t makin’ nothin’ up.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How about us? Is that the truth for us?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: You folks aim to buy anything?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Need some gas, mister.</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: Got any money?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Whatta you think:–we’s beggin’?</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: I just ast, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, ask right. You ain’t talkin’ to bums, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: All in the worl’ I done was ast!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Kinda pie y’got?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate
cream–and apple.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a
cuppa java.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Make it two.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Two it is. Seen any new etchin’s lately,
Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, here’s one ain’t bad. Little kid comes
in late to school. Teacher says–</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf
of bread, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: This ain’t a groc’ry store. We got bread to
make san’widges with.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: I know, ma’am… on’y it’s for a ole lady, no
teeth, gotta sof’n it with water so she can chew it, an’ she’s
hongry.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Whyn’t you buy a san’wich? We got nice
san’widges.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: I shore would like to do that, ma’am, but the
fack is, we ain’t got but a dime for it. It’s all figgered out, I
mean–for the trip.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: You can’t get no loaf a bread for a dime. We
only got fifteen-cent loafs.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Give ’em the bread.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: We’ll run out ’fore the bread truck comes.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Awright then, run out!</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: This here’s a fifteen-cent loaf.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Would you–could you see your way to cuttin’ off
ten cents worth?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Give ’im the loaf!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: No, sir, we wanta buy ten cents worth, thas
all.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: You can have this for ten cents.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: I don’t wanta rob you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Go ahead–Bert says take it.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: May soun’ funny to be so tight, but we got a
thousan’ miles to go, an’ we don’t know if we’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Is them penny candy, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Which ones?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: There, them stripy ones.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Oh, them? Well, no–them’s two for a penny.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Well, give me two then, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Sure, take ’em, take ’em!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Thank you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Them wasn’t two-for-a-cent candy.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Them was nickel apiece candy.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We got to get goin’. We’re droppin’ time.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin’.</p>
<p><strong>bill’s voice</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Bert.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: What ya want?</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Look here.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Truck drivers.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I figgered No. 3 was about ready to pay
off.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: How long you plan to be in Arizona?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No longer’n we can get acrost her.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Got any plants?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No plants.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep
movin’.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure. We aim to.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: There she is, folks–the land a milk an’
honey–California!</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Well, if that’s what we come out here
for…</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Maybe it’s nice on the other side. Them
pitchers–them little pos’cards– they was real pretty.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Aw, sure. This here’s jus’ a part of it. Ain’t
no sense a gettin’ scairt right off.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Course not. Come on, let’s get goin’. She don’t
look so tough to me!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight.
Take her in the daytime fella says she’ll cut your gizzard out.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: How’s Granma since we got her in the tent?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: She’s off her chump, seems to me.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: She’s outa her senses, awright. All night on
the truck keep talkin’ like she was talkin’ to Grampa.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s jus’ wore out, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: I shore would like to stop here a while an’ give
her some res’ but we on’y got ‘bout forty dollars left. I won’t feel
right till we’re there an’ all workin’ an’ a little money comin’ in.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Like to jus’ stay here myself. Like to lay
here forever. Never get hungry an’ never get sad. Lay in the water all
life long, lazy as a brood sow in the mud.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Never seen such tough mountains. This here’s a
murder country, just the bones of a country. Wonder if we’ll ever get in
a place where folks can live ‘thout fightin’ hard scrabble an’ rock.
Sometimes you get to thinkin’ they ain’t no such country.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: How’s the swimmin’?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Dunno. We ain’t tried none. Sure feels good to
set here, though.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Mind if we come in an’ set?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She ain’t our river. But we’ll len’ you a
little piece of her.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Goin’ west?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Nope. We come from there. Goin’ back
home.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where’s home?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Panhandle, come from near Pampa.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Can you make a livin’ there?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But at leas’ we can starve to death with folks
we know.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Ya know, you’re the second fella talked like
that. I’d like to hear some more about that.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Me an’ you both.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: He ain’t gonna tell you nothin’ about it.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: If a fella’s willin’ to work hard, can’t he cut
her?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Listen, mister. I don’t know ever’thing. You
might go out an’ fall into a steady job, an’ I’d be a liar. An’ then,
you might never get no work, an’ I didn’t warn you. All I can tell ya,
most of the folks is purty mis’able. But a fella don’t know
ever’thing.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: John, you never was a fella to say much, but
I’ll be goldanged if you opened your mouth twicet since we lef’ home.
What you think about this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t think nothin’ about it. We’re a-goin’
there, ain’t we? When we get there, we’ll get there. When we get a job,
we’ll work, an’ when we don’t get a job we’ll set on our behin’s. That’s
all they is to it, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Uncle John don’t talk much but when he does he
shore talks sense.</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: You people got a lotta nerve.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What you mean?</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: Crossin’ the desert in a jalopy like
this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You been acrost?</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like
this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: If we broke down maybe somebody’d give us a
han’.</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: Well, maybe. But I’d hate to be doin’ it.
Takes more nerve than I got.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It don’t take no nerve to do somep’n when there
ain’t nothin’ else you can do.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Don’t you worry, Granma. It’s gonna be
awright.</p>
<p><strong>granma</strong>: Grampa… Grampa… I want Grampa…</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Don’t you fret now.</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: Holy Moses, what a hard-lookin’
outfit!</p>
<p><strong>second boy</strong>: All them Okies is hard-lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: Boy, but I’d hate to hit that desert in a
jalopy like that!</p>
<p><strong>second boy</strong>: Well, you and me got sense. Them Okies
got no sense or no feeling. They ain’t human. A human being wouldn’t
live like they do. A human being couldn’t stand it to be so
miserable.</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: Just don’t know any better, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What a place! How’d you like to walk acrost
her?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: People done it. If they could, we could.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Lots must a died, too.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, we ain’t out a it yet.</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: This here’s the desert an’ we’re right in
it!</p>
<p><strong>winfield</strong>: I wisht it was day.</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Tom says if it’s day it’ll cut you gizzard
smack out a you. I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever’place.</p>
<p><strong>winfield</strong>: Man bones?</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Some, I guess, but mos’ly cow bones.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: ’S awright, honey. Everything’s gonna be
awright.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Seems like we wasn’t never gonna do
nothin’ but move. I’m so tar’d.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Women is always tar’d.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: You ain’t–you ain’t sorry, are you,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: No, but–but you seen that advertisement in
the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don’t pay nothin’. Jus’ send ‘em the
coupon an’ you’re a radio expert–nice clean work.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: But we can still do it, honey.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: I ought to done it then–an’ not come on any
trip like this.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: We can’t give up, honey. The family’s got to get
acrost. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Ever’thing all right?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Yes, ever’thing’s all right. I–I guess I dropped
off to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s this here?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Agricultural inspection. We got to go over
your stuff. Got any vegetables or seed?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Well, we got to look over your stuff. You
got to unload.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Look, mister. We got a sick ol’ lady. We got to
get her to a doctor. We can’t wait. You can’t make us wait!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yeah? Well, we got to look you over.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I swear we ain’t got anything. I swear it. An’
Granma’s awful sick. Look!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: You wasn’t foolin’! You swear you got no
fruit or vegetables?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: No, I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Then go ahead. You can get a doctor at
Barstow. That’s just eight miles. But don’t stop. Don’t get off.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay, cap. Much oblige.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Tell Tom he don’t have to stop. Granma’s all
right.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Will ya look at her!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: I never knowed they was anything like her!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where’s Ma? I want Ma to see it. Look, Ma! Come

<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ma, you sick?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Ya say we’re acrost?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look, Ma!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Thank God! An’ we’re still together– most of
us.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Didn’ you get no sleep?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Was Granma bad?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Granma’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Since before they stopped us las’ night.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: An’ that’s why you didn’t want ’em to look?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I was afraid they’d stop us an’ wouldn’t let us
cross. But I tol’ Granma. I tol’ her when she was dyin’. I tol’ her the
fambly had ta get acrost. I tol’ her we couldn’t take no chances on
bein’ stopped.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: So it’s all right. At leas’ she’ll get buried in
a nice green place. Trees and flowers aroun’. She got to lay her head
down in California after all.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: How far you figger you gonna get this
way?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Right here. We give out a gas.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where’s the bes’ place to get some work aroun’
here? Don’t matter what kin’ either.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: If I seen one a them things I must a seen
ten thousan’.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Ain’t it no good?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Not here–not now. Month ago there was
some pickin’ but it’s all moved south now. Where’bouts in Oklahoma you
from?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sallisaw.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: I come out from Cherokee County–two years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Why, Connie’s folks from Cherokee
County–</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Okay, ma’am, let’s don’t go into it. I
already met about a hundred firs’ cousins an’ it mus’ be five hundred
secon’. But this is what I got to tell you, don’t try to park in town
tonight. Keep on out to that camp. If we catch you in town after dark we
got to lock you up. Don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: But what we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Pop, that just ain’t up to me. But I
don’t min’ tellin’ you, the guy they ought to lock up is the guy that
sent out them things.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: How many, folks?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She shore don’t look prosperous. Want to go
somewheres else?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: On a gallon a gas? Let’s set up the tent. Maybe
I can fix us up some stew.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I could break up some bresh if you want me,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You want to get ast to eat, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Didn’ you have no breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No, ma’am. They ain’t no work hereabouts. Pa’s
in tryin’ to sell some stuff to get gas so’s we can get along.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Didn’ none of these have no breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I did. Me an’ my brother did. We et good.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Then you ain’t hungry, are you?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: We et good.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Well, it’s a good thing some a you ain’t hungry,
because they ain’t enough to go all the way roun’.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Aw, he was braggin’. Know what he done? Las’
night, come out an’ say they got chicken to eat. Well, sir, I looked in
whilst they was a-eatin’ an’ it was fried dough jus’ like ever’body
else.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: How ’bout it?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Go get Tom an’ Al. I dunno what to do. I got to
feed the fambly. What’m I gonna do with these here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You take this. I ain’t hungry.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Whatta ya mean? You ain’t et today.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain’t
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You take that plate inside the tent an’ you eat
it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wouldn’t be no use. I’d still see ’em inside
the tent.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You git. Go on now, git. You ain’t doin’ no
good. They ain’t enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: We can’t send ‘em away. Take your plates an’ go
inside. Take a plate to Rosasharn. Look. You little fellas go an’ get
you each a flat stick an’ I’ll put what’s lef’ for you. But they ain’t
to be no fightin’! I don’t know if I’m doin’ right or not but–go inside,
ever’body stay inside. They ain’t enough. All you gonna get is jus’ a
taste but–I can’t help it, I can’t keep it from you.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I done fine! Now nobody got enough!</p>
<p><strong>at the group of men</strong>: The agent, wearing a
flat-brimmed Stetson and with his pockets filled with pencils and
dog-eared booklets, looks down at the silent men. All of the men in the
camp are approaching slowly, silently. The women give their anxious
attention in the background. Among the men who walk up is FLOYD, a
grimly disappointed young man.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You men want to work?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Sure we wanta work. Where’s it at?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Tulare County. Fruit’s opening up. Need a lot
of pickers.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: You doin’ the hirin’?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Well, I’m contracting the land.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Whay you payin?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Well, can’t tell exactly, yet. ’Bout thirty
cents, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Why can’t you tell? You took the
contrac’, didn’ you?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: That’s true. But it’s keyed to the price.
Might be a little more, might be a little less.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: All right, mister. I’ll go. You just show
your license to contrack, an’ then you make out a order–where an’ when
an’ how much you gonna pay–an’ you sign it an’ we’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You trying to tell me how to run my own
business?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: ‘F we’re workin’ for you, it’s our business
too. An’ how do we know– –you ain’t one a the guys that sent these
things out?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Listen, Smart Guy. I’ll run my business my
own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Twicet now I’ve fell for that line. Maybe he
needs a thousan’ men. So he get’s five thousan’ there, an’ he’ll pay
fifteen cents a hour. An’ you guys’ll have to take it ‘cause you’ll be
hungry. ’F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an’ say what he’s
gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain’t allowed by law to contrack
men without a license.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Joe!</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: You see? If this guy was on the level, would
he bring a cop along?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: What’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Ever see this guy before?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: What’d he do?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: He’s agitatin’.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Hmmm. Seems like I have. Seems like I seen
him hangin’ around that used car lot that was busted into. Yep, I’d
swear it’s the same fella. Get in that car.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You got nothin’ on him.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Open your trap again and you’ll go too.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You fellas don’t wanta lissen to
troublemakers. You better pack up an’ come on to Tulare County.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Might be a good idea to do what he says. Too
many of you Okies aroun’ here already. Folks beginnin’ to figger it
ain’t maybe safe. Might start a epidemic or sump’n. Wouldn’t like a
bunch a guys down here with pick handles tonight, would you?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Now, you.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in
them willows an’ wait.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I ain’t gonna run.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted?
You wanta get sent back for breakin’ parole?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You’re right!</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Hide in the willows. If it’s awright to come
back I’ll give you four high whistles.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Go on. Get in your tent. You don’t know
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: How ’bout you?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Somebody got to take the blame. They just got
to hang it on somebody, you know. An’ I ain’t doin’ nothin’ but set
around.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: But ain’t no reason–</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Lissen. I don’t care nothin’ about you, but if
you mess in this, your whole fambly li’ble to get in trouble, an’ Tom
get sent back to the penitentiary.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Okay. I think you’re a darn fool, though.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Sure. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: What’s goin’ on here?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: This man a yours, he got tough an’ I hit him.
Then he started shootin’– hit a woman down the line–so I hit him
again.</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: Well–what’d you do in the first
place?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I talked back.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: They’s a woman down there like to bleed to
death from his bad shootin’.</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: Take a look at her. Mike, is this the
fella that hit you?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Don’t look like him.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: It was me, all right. You just got smart with
the wrong fella.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Don’t look like him, but… maybe it was. I
ain’t sure.</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: Get in that car.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Boy, what a mess a .45 does make! They got a
tourniquet on. We’ll send a doctor out.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: But what you gonna do? Must be thousands of
’em around here, sore and hungry and living in them dumps. What you
gonna do about ’em?</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: You gotta hold ’em down. Hold ’em
down or they’ll take over the whole country. That’s all you can do.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Well, they ain’t gonna take over my country.
I been livin’ here too long for that. Maybe some a the boys better drop
around tonight and give ’em something to think about.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Leave him alone, Ma–Al’s just billy- goatin’
around–</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Sure! I was just aimin’ to meet up with a couple
girls I know.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You don’t know no girls around here. You’re
lyin’, You’re runnin’ away!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: momentary but ill</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You’ll what?… Come on, Pa. Come on an’ whup me.
Jus’ try it.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Now don’t get sassy, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Al ain’t a-goin’ away, an’ you gonna tell him he
ain’t a-goin’ away. An’ if you think diff’unt, you gotta whup me first.
So some on.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: I never seen her so sassy. An’ she ain’t so
young, neither!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I’d come back–</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: But ef you do whup me, I swear you better not
ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you’re
settin’ down, or your back’s turned, I’m gonna knock you belly-up with a
bucket.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Jus’ sassy, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Sassy my foot! I’m jus’ sick and tar’d a my
folks tryin’ to bust up. All we got lef’ in the worl’ is the fambly–an’
right down at bottom that’s all we got to have! Ef some of us dies, we
can’t he’p that–but ain’t nobody else runnin’ away!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: But it ain’t runnin’ away, Ma. All I wanta do is
go away with another fella an’ look aroun’ for work by ourself–</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Well, you ain’t a-goin’! Ain’t nobody else
a-goin’! We got here an’ we gonna stay here, together! As long as we got
the fambly unbroke I ain’t scared, but it’s a long bitter road we got
ahead of us– –an’ I’m here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us
up anymore I’m a-goin’ cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey, Al!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Tom? You can come on. They gone.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We got to get outa here right away. Ever’body
here? Where’s Uncle John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: What’s a matter now?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fella tells me some a them poolroom boys
figgerin’ to burn the whole camp out tonight. Got to get that truck
loaded–what you doin’ with the jack-handle, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma, pa, and al</strong>: Al’s tryin’ to go away… She jus’ got
sassy… All I aimed to do…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Awright, you can fight it out later. Right now
we got to hustle. Where’s Connie?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Connie’s gone. Lit out this e’enin’–said he
didn’t know it was gonna be like this.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an’
never will be–</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Pa! Shh!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: How come I got to shh? Run out, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Cut it out, Pa. He’p Al with the truck. Don’t
fret, honey. You goin’ to be awright.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Tom, I jus’ don’t feel like nothin’ a
tall. Without him I jus’ don’t wanta live.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maybe he’ll be back. We’ll leave word for him.
Jus’ don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just in case. Sit up back an’ if anybody tries
to climb up–let ’im have it.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: I ain’t got nothin’ in my han’.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Give ‘im a fryin’ pan.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Maybe Connie went to get some books to
study up with. He’s gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered
to suprise us.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Maybe that’s jus’ what he done.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Tom–you tol’ me–you promised you wasn’t like
that. You promised me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I know, Ma. I’m a tryin’. If it was the law
they was workin’ with, we could take it. But it ain’t the law. They’re
workin’ away at our spirits. They’re tryin’ to make us cringe an’ crawl.
They’re workin’ on our decency.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You promised, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m a-tryin’, Ma. Honest I am.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly’s breakin’
up. You got to keep clear.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s that–detour?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Where you think you’re goin’?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well– –we’re strangers here. We heard about
they’s work in a place called Tulare.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Well, you’re goin’ the wrong way, an’ what’s
more, we don’t want no more Okies in this town. We ain’t got work enough
for them that are already here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Which way is it at, mister?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: You turn right aroun’ and head north. An’
don’t come back till the cotton’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Don’t you min’, Tommy. You done good. You done
jus’ good.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Sump’n got to happen soon. We got one day’s more
grease, two day’s flour, an’ ten potatoes. After that… An’ Rosasharn, we
got to remember she’s gonna be due soon.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: It sure is hell jus’ tryin’ to get enough to
eat.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fella tells me they’s three hunerd thousan’
aroun’ here like us, a- scrabblin’ for work an’ livin’ like hogs. Can’t
figger what it is, but sump’n’s wrong.</p>

<p><strong>tom</strong>: We can pick anything.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Well, there’s plenty of work for you about

<p><strong>ma</strong>: Fust thing I’ll get is coffee, cause ever’body

<p><strong>al</strong>: Know what I’m a-gonna do? I’m a-gonna save up
an’ go in town an’ get me a job in a garage. Live in a room an’ eat in
restaurants. Go to the movin’ pitchers ever’ night. Cowboy pitchers.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What is it, a wreck?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Where you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fella named Spencer sent us–said they was work

<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s the matter? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Little trouble up ahead, but you’ll get
through. Just follow the line.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Maybe the road’s out.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t know what these cops got to do with it
but I don’t like it. An’ these here are our own people, all of ’em. I
don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Go on, go on! Keep movin’!</p>

<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: Not here. Take a look at his

<p><strong>al</strong>: Think I’ll look aroun’ an’ see if I can’t meet
me a girl.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thing’s been workin’ on me, what they was
yellin’ about. Got me all curious.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I got to get a lot curiouser than I am–with
all them cops out there.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay. I be back a little later.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You be careful, Tommy. Don’t you be stickin’
your nose in anything.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay, Ma. Don’t you worry.</p>
<p><strong>near the gate</strong>: beyond, cars pass. As Tom approaches
the gate a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises from
a box.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Where you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thought I’d take a walk. Any law against
it?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Well, you just turn around and walk the other
way.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You mean I can’t even get outa here?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Not tonight you can’t. Want to walk back?–or
you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll walk back.</p>
<p><strong>a tent</strong>: there is a light inside and there are the
shadows of figures. In the background, beyond the tent, is the
silhouette of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream. Following
a trail, Tom enters and approaches the tent. IN FRONT OF THE TENT, a man
sitting on a box looks up suspiciously as Tom enters. His name is
Joe.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Evenin’.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Jus’ goin’ pas’, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Know anybody here?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No. Jus’ goin’ pas’, I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Casy! What you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Well, if it ain’t Tom Joad. How ya, boy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thought you was in jail.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: No, I done my time an’ got out. Come on
in.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This the fella you been talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: This is him. What you doin’ here, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Workin’. Pickin’ peaches. But I seen a bunch a
fellas yellin’ when we come in, so I come out to see what’s goin’ on.
What’s it all about?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This here’s a strike.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, fi’ cents a box ain’t much, but a fella
can eat.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fi’ cents! They pain’ you fi’ cents?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure. We made a buck since midday.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell
us it’s gonna be fi’ cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man
says two an’ a half cents. Well, a fella can’t even eat on that, an’ if
he got kids… So we says we won’t take it. So they druv us off. Now
they’re payin’ you five–but when they bust this strike ya think they’ll
pay five?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I dunno. Payin’ five now.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I don’t expeck we can las’ much longer– some a
the folks ain’t et for two days. You goin’ back tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I aim to.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Well–tell the folks inside how it is, Tom.
Tell ‘em they’re starvin’ us and stabbin’ theirself in the back. An’ as
sure as God made little apples it’s goin’ back to two an’ a half jus’ as
soon as they clear us out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You hear sump’n?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll tell ’em. But I don’t know how. Never seen
so many guys with guns. Wouldn’t even let us talk today.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Try an’ tell ‘em, Tom. They’ll get two an’ a
half, jus’ the minute we’re gone. An’ you know what that is? That’s one
ton a peaches picked an’ carried for a dollar. That way you can’t even
buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell ‘em to come out with us, Tom!
Them peaches is ripe. Two days out an’ they’ll pay all of us five!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They won’t. They’re a-gettin’ five an’ they
don’t care about nothin’ else.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: But jus’ the minute they ain’t strike-
breakin’ they won’t get no five!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: An’ the nex’ thing you know you’ll be out,
because they got it all figgered down to a T–until the harvest is in
you’re a migrant worker–afterwards, just a bum.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Five they’re a-gettin’ now, an’ that’s all
they’re int’rested in. I know exackly what Pa’d say. He’d jus’ say it
wasn’t none a his business.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: I guess that’s right. Have to take a beatin’
before he’ll know.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not
much, but we had it. Think Pa’s gonna give up his meat on account a
other fellas? An’ Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma’s gonna starve that
baby jus’ cause a bunch a fellas is yellin’ outside a gate?</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Got to learn, like I’m a-learnin’. Don’t know
it right yet myself, but I’m tryin’ to fin’ out. That’s why I can’t ever
be a preacher again. Preacher got to know. I don’t. I got to ask.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Can’t tell. Seems like I hear sump’n, an’ then
I listen an’ they ain’t nothin’ to hear.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: ’Tain’t outa the question, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: All of us a little itchy. Cops been tellin’ us
how they gonna beat us up an’ run us outa the country. Not them reg’lar
deppities, but them tin- star fellas they got for guards. They figger
I’m the leader because I talk so much.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Turn out that light an’ come outside. They’s
sump’n here.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I dunno. Listen.</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Can’t tell if you hear it or not. You hear it,
Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I hear it. I think they’s some guys comin’ this
way, lots of ’em. We better get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Down that way–under the bridge span.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There they are! Stand where you are!</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: That’s him! That one in the middle, the
skinny one! Chuck! Alec! Here they are! We got ’em!</p>
<p><strong>casy</strong>: Listen, you fellas. You don’t know what you’re
doin’. You’re helpin’ to stave kids.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Shut up, you red–</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: Looks like to me you killed him.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Turn him over. Put the light on him.</p>
<p><strong>deputy’s voice</strong>: Serves him right, too.</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: Where’s that flash?</p>
<p><strong>third deputy</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>third deputy</strong>: Boy, he’s good and dead! You see that
fella that done it?</p>
<p><strong>second deputy</strong>: I ain’t sure–but I caught him one
across the face, and believe me, I give him a trade-mark he ain’t gonna
be able to shake off easy!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Anybody ask anything?</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: No’m.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Stand by the door.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: How’s it feel, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Busted my cheek but I can still see. What’d you
hear?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Looks like you done it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I kinda thought so. Felt like it.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Folks ain’t talkin’ about much else. They say
they got posses out. Talkin’ about a lynchin’–when they catch the
fella.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They killed Casy first.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: That ain’t the way they’re tellin’ it. They’re
sayin’ you done it fust.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They know what–this fella looks like?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: They know he got hit in the face.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m sorry, Ma. But–I didn’t know what I was
doin’, no more’n when you take a breath. I didn’t even know I was gonna
do it.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: It’s awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn’t do it,
but you done what you had to do. I can’t read no fault in you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m gonna go away tonight. I can’t go puttin’
this on you folks.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Tom! They’s a whole lot I don’t understan’, but
goin’ away ain’t gonna ease us. They was the time when we was on the
lan’. They was a bound’ry to us then. Ol’ folks died off, an’ little
fellas come, an’ we was always one thing– we was the fambly–kinda whole
an’ clear. But now we ain’t clear no more. They ain’t nothin’ keeps us
clear. Al–he’s a-hankerin’ an’ a- jibbitin’ to go off on his own. An’
Uncle John is just a-draggin’ along. Pa’s lost his place–he ain’t the
head no more. We’re crackin’ up, Tom. They ain’t no fambly now.
Rosasharn– –she gonna have her baby, but it ain’t gonna have no fambly.
I been tryin’ to keep her goin’ but–Winfiel’– what’s he gonna be,
this-a-way? Growin’ up wild, an’ Ruthie, too– like animals. Got nothin’
to trus’. Don’t go Tom. Stay an’ help. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay, Ma. I shouldn’t, though. I know I
shouldn’t. But okay.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Here come a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper’s voice</strong>: How many of you?</p>
<p><strong>migrant’s voice</strong>: Ten of us. Whatcha payin’?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: House 25. Number’s on the door.</p>
<p><strong>migrant</strong>: Okay, mister. Whatcha payin’?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: Two and a half cents.</p>
<p><strong>migrant</strong>: Two an’ a half! Say, mister, a man can’t
make his dinner on that.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: Take it or leave it. There’s 200 men
coming from the South that’ll be glad to get it.</p>
<p><strong>migrant</strong>: But–but how we gonna eat?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: Look, I didn’t set the price. I’m just
working here. If you want it, take it. If you don’t, turn right around
and beat it.</p>
<p><strong>migrant</strong>: Which way is House 25?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but–he
seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern–he helped mw see things
too.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Comes night we’ll get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: It’s jus’ till we get some distance. Then you
can come out.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’d hate to get trapped in here.</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: What’s goin’ on here?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: We’re goin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: We got a job offered–good job.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yeah? Let’s have a look at you. Wasn’t there
another fella with you?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella
with a pale face?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I guess that’s what he looked like.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: We just picked him up on the way in. He went
away this mornin’ when the rate dropped.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’d he look like again?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Short fella. Pale face.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Was he bruised up this mornin’? About the
face?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I didn’t see nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Okay. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Goin’ out for good?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Yeah. Goin’ north. Got a job.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You done good, Al. Just good.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Know where we’re a-goin’?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Don’t matter. Just got to go–an’ keep a-goin’,
till we get plenty a distance away from here.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Ma… you know, if Connie was here I
wouldn’t min’ any a this.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I know, honey, an’ just as soon as we get
settled Al’s gonna set out an’ look for him. How ’bout gas, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Full up. Uncle John come through with five
bucks he been hol’in’ out on us since we lef’ home.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s hotter’n a heifer.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Fan-belt’s shot.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Picks a nice place for it, too, don’t she?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Any gas?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Gallon or two?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, looks like we done it this time
awright!</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Tommy. Some smoke up there.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Looks like about a mile. Reckon she’ll make
it?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: She got to make it.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t know–but it’s better’n this.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: You hit ’er too fast.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What’s the idea of that?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Well, a lot a kids play in here. You tell
folks to go slow and they liable to forget. But let ’em hit that hump
once and they don’t forget!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Got any room here for us?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: You’re lucky. Fellow just moved out
half-hour ago. Down that line and turn to the left. You’ll see it.
You’ll be in No. 4 Sanitary Unit.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Toilet and showers and washtubs.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You mean you got washtubs? An’ runnin’
water?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Yes, ma’am. Camp committee’ll call on you
in the morning and get you fixed.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Cops?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: No. No cops. Folks here elect their own
cops. The ladies’ committee’ll call on you, ma’am, about the kids and
the sanitary unit and who takes care of ’em. Come inside and sign
up.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Take ’er on down, Al. I’ll sign.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: We gonna stay, ain’t we?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You’re tootin’ we’re gonna stay.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: I don’t mean to be nosy, y’understand. I
just got to have certain information. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Joad. Tom Joad.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: How many of you?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: How ’bout it, Uncle John? Gotta pitch this
tent.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m a-comin’.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You don’t look so good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I ain’t so good, but–I’m a-comin’.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you
can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean–stuff like
that.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’ll work it out. What’s this committee you
talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: We got five sanitary units. Each one
elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an’ what they say
goes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Are you aimin’ to tell me that the fellas that
run this camp is jus’ fellas–campin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: That’s the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: An’ you say no cops?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: No cop can come in here without a
warrant.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I can’t hardly believe it. Camp I was in once,
they burned it out–the deputies an’ some of them poolroom fellas.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: They don’t get in here. Sometimes the
boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You got dances too?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: We got the best dances in the county

<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Can’t promise you that, but there’ll be a
licensed agent here tomorrow mornin’, if you want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ma’s shore gonna like it here. She ain’t been

<p><strong>tom</strong>: Crate fell on me.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Better take care of it. Store manager’ll

<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: It’s them white things, made outa

<p><strong>winfield’s voice</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>ruthie’s voice</strong>: Now don’t you go monk’ing–</p>
<p><strong>ruthie’s voice</strong>: Now you done it! You busted it!</p>
<p><strong>winfield’s voice</strong>: I never–</p>
<p><strong>winfield</strong>: Lemme go! I didn’t go to do it!</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Keep qui’te, will ya! Shet your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>winfield</strong>: I never knowed it! All I done was pull

<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Lissen. You done busted it. You hear? But
lissen here. I won’t tell nobody, y’understan’?</p>
<p><strong>winfield</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: I won’t– –if you won’t tell what I done!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: If this don’t feel good!</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: Wait’ll about ’leven o’clock, see how good
she feels then!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Seems like a nice frien’ly fella to work for,
too.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas.
Trouble is they’re little, they ain’t got much say-so.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin’
some work at las’.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Lissen here. Maybe I’m talkin’ myself outa
my farm, but I like you fellas, so I’m gonna tell you. You live in that
gov’ment camp, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: And you have dances every Saturday
night?</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: We sure do.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Well, look out next Saturday night.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What you mean? I belong to the central
committee. I got to know.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Don’t you ever tell I told.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Well, the association don’t like the
government camps. Can’t get a deputy in there. Can’t arrest a man
without a warrant. But if there was a big fight, and maybe shooting–a
bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp. Like last night.
Lissen. “Citizens, angered at red agitators, burn another squatters’
camp, warn agitators to get out of the county.”</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Listen. What is these reds? Ever’time you turn
aroun’ somebody sayin’ somebody else’s a red. What is these reds,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: Well, I tell you. They was a fella up the
country named King–got about 30,000 acres an’ a cannery an’ a winery–an’
he’s all a time talkin’ about reds. Drivin’ the country to ruin, he
says. Got to git rid of ‘em, he says. Well, they was a young fella jus’
come out an’ he was listenin one day. He kinda scratched his head an’ he
says, “Mr. King, what is these reds you all a time talkin’ about?” Well,
sir, Mr. King says, “Young man, a red is any fella that wants thirty
cents a hour when I’m payin’ twenty-five.”</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I ain’t talkin’ about that one way or the
other. All I’m saying is that there’s going to be a fight in the camp
Saturday night. And there’s going to be deputies ready to go in.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: But why? Those fellas ain’t botherin’
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’ll tell you why. Those folks in to being
treated like humans. Suppose the Government closes its camps. Suppose
too many people pass through ‘em. Well, when those people go back to the
squatters’ camps they’ll be hard to handle. Go on back to work now.
Maybe I’ve talked myself into trouble, but you’re folks like us, and I
like you.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Nobody won’t know who tol’. We thank you. An’
they ain’t gonna be no fight, either.</p>
<p><strong>committee man</strong>: Ev’nin’, ma’am. Who’d you say invited
you?</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Mister an’ Mizz Clark, they ast us.</p>
<p><strong>committee man</strong>: Yes, ma’am. Come right in, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: Hidy, Mr. Thomas. Hidy, Mizz Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You watching out, ain’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: Don’t you worry. Ain’t gonna be no
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I hope you know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: Ma… Ma, I–I can’t go to the dance. I jus’
can’t Ma. I can’t hardly stan’ it, with Connie not here–an’ me this
way.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl
that way–makes folks sort of giggly an’ happy.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: I can’t he’p it, Ma. It don’t make me
giggly an’ happy.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You an’ me’s goin’ together–jus’ you an’ me.
We’re a-goin’ to that dance an’ we’re a-goin’ to jus’ set an’ watch. If
anybody says to come dance–why I’ll say you’re poorly. But you an’ me,
we’re gonna hear the music an’ see the fun.</p>
<p><strong>rosasharn</strong>: An’ you won’t let nobody touch me?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: No–an’ look what I got for you.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I used to wear these–when your pa come callin’
on me. You’ll look pretty in ’em tonight.</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: They tell me you’re half Injun. You look all
Injun to me.</p>
<p><strong>jule</strong>: No, jes’ half. Wisht I was full- blooded.
Gov’ment’d be lookin’ out for me an’ I’d be ridin’ around in a Buick
eight.</p>
<p><strong>committee man</strong>: Who give you the invitation?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fella named Jackson–Buck Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>committee man</strong>: Okay. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>jule</strong>: Them’s our fellas.</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: How you know?</p>
<p><strong>jule</strong>: Jes’ got a feelin’. They’re kinda scared too.
Follow ‘em an’ get a holt of Jackson. See if he knows ’em. I’ll stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>fiddler</strong>: Swing your ladies an’ a dol ce do. Join
han’s roun’ an’ away we go! Swing to the right an’ a swing to the lef’.
Break, now break–back to back!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Thank you kin’ly but she ain’t well.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Maybe you wouldn’t think it, but your pa was as
nice a dancer as I ever seen, when he was young. Kinda makes me think a
ol’ times.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I seen ’em before. Worked at Gregorio’s
with ’em. But I never ast ’em.</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: Awright. Keep your eye on ‘em. Jus’ keep ’em
in sight, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I seen ‘em, Mr. Wallace. A car with six men
parked down by the euc’lyptus tree an’ one with three men on the main
road. They got guns, too. I seen ’em.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Thank you, Willie. You done good. Well, it
looks like the fat’s in the far this time.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: What them deppities want to hurt the camp
for? How come they can’t leave us be?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: What we oughta do, we oughta git us some
pickhandles an’–</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No! That’s what they want. No sir. If they can
git a fight goin’, then they can run in the cops an’ say we ain’t
orderly–</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: They’re here. We got ’em spotted.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You sure you got ever’thing ready?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ain’t gonna be no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You ain’t to hurt them fellas.</p>
<p><strong>wilkie</strong>: You don’t have to worry. We got ever’thing
arranged. Maybe nobody’ll even see it.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Just don’t use no stick nor no knife, no piece
a arn. An’ if you got to sock ’em, sock ’em where they won’t bleed.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Awright. An’ if she gets outa han’, I’ll be in
the right han’ corner, this side the dance floor.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ain’t gonna get outa han’.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Mighty sure a themselves, looks like.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: All I hope, I hope they don’t kill nobody.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Gonna dance tonight? I can waltz.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s nothin’–anybody can waltz.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Not like me!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You git right along! This here girl’s spoke
for. She’s gonna be married, an’ her man’s a-comin’ for her.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s gettin’ prettier, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Girl with a baby always gets prettier.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Excuse me, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Well, you said anybody can waltz… How’m I
doin’?</p>
<p><strong>blonde girl</strong>: Don’t hold me so tight.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Why, I ain’t hardly touchin’ you!</p>
<p><strong>blonde girl</strong>: You’re ticklin’ me!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: That comes from not holdin’ you tight
enough.</p>
<p><strong>blonde girl</strong>: Now I can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I’ll dance with this girl.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You an’ who else?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Don’t gimme no argament– –you little–</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Open up! We hear you got a riot.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Riot? I don’t see no riot. Who’re
you?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Deputy sheriffs.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Got a warrant?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: We don’t need a warrant if it’s a riot.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Well, I don’t know what you gonna do
about it, because I don’t hear no riot an’ I don’t see no riot, an’
what’s more I don’t believe they is no riot. Look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: You got no right to arrest anybody
without a warrant, you know.</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: We’ll have a warrant–just as soon as we
check with headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Ain’t you gonna tell me goodbye, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I didn’t know, Ma. I didn’t know if I
ought.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Come outside.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin’
down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump’n.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’d like to stay. I’d like to be with ya– –an’
see your face when you an’ Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure
wish I could see you then. But– –I guess I won’t never be able to do
that. Not now.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I could hide you, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I know you would, Ma. But I ain’t gonna let
you. You hide somebody that’s kilt a man an’… an’ you’d be in trouble
too.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You know what I been thinkin’ about, Ma? About
Casy. About what he said, what he done, an’ about how he died. An’ I
remember all of it.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: He was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I been thinkin’ about us, too–about our people
livin’ like pigs, an’ good rich lan’ layin’ fallow, or maybe one fella
with a million acres, while a hundred thousan’ farmers is starvin’. An’
I been wonderin’ if all our folks got together an’ yelled–</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Tommy, they’ll drive you, an’ cut you down like
they done to Casy.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later
they’ll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then…</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: You don’t aim to kill nobody, Tom!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, Ma. Not that. That ain’t it. But long as
I’m a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump’n. Maybe I can jus’ fin’ out
sump’n. Jus’ scrounge aroun’ an’ try to fin’ out what it is that’s
wrong, an then see if they ain’t sump’n could be done about it. But I
ain’t thought it out clear, Ma. I can’t. I don’t know enough.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: How’m I gonna know ‘bout you? They might kill
you an’ I wouldn’t know. They might hurt you. How’m I gonna know?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, maybe it’s like Casy says, a fella ain’t
got a soul of his own, but on’y a piece of a big soul–the one big soul
that belongs to ever’body– an’ then…</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Then what, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Then it don’t matter. Then I’ll be all aroun’
in the dark. I’ll be ever’where–wherever you look. Wherever there’s a
fight so hungry people can eat, I’ll be there. Wherever there’s a cop
beatin’ up a guy, I’ll be there. I’ll be in the way guys yell when
they’re mad–an’ I’ll be in the way kids laugh when they’re hungry an’
they know supper’s ready. An’ when our people eat the stuff they raise,
an’ live in the houses they build, why, I’ll be there too.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I don’t understan’ it, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Me neither. It’s jus’ stuff I been thinkin’
about. Gimme you han’, Ma. Good-by.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Good-by, Tom. Later–when it’s blowed over–you’ll
come back? You’ll try to fin’ us?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure. Good-by.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Good-by, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>al, pa, john</strong>: Get them buckets on! Somebody tie down
the mattress! You little fellas keep outa the way!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What y’all hurryin’ so for? Tell me they got
twenny days work.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Yes, sir, an’ we aim to git in all twenny of
’em.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Ready, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I’ll get Rosasharn.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: All aboard, ever’body! All aboard for
Fresno!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Try to be strong, honey. Someday it’ll be
diff’rent–someday you’ll have another one. You’re still jus’ a little
girl, remember.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Make her easy, John. Watch her.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: She’ll be awright.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Ready, Pa?</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Let ’er go, Gallagher!</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Good luck to you! Good luck,
ever’body!</p>
<p><strong>the joads</strong>: Good-by, Mr. Conway! Much oblige to you
for ever’thing!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Twenty days work, oh boy!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Be glad to get my han’ on some cotton. That’s
the kin’ a pickin’ I understan’.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe no days
work. We ain’t got it till we get it.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin’ scared?</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: No. Ain’t ever gonna be scared no more. I was,
though. For a while I thought we was beat–good an’ beat. Looked like we
didn’t have nothin’ in the worl’ but enemies–wasn’t nobody frien’ly
anymore. It made me feel bad an’ scared too–like we was lost… an’ nobody
cared.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Watch me pass that Chevvy.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: You the one that keeps us goin’, Ma. I ain’t no
good any more, an’ I know it. Seems like I spen’ all my time these days
a-thinkin’ how it use’ta be–thinkin’ of home–an’ I ain’t never gonna see
it no more.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Woman can change better’n a man. Man lives in
jerks–baby born, or somebody dies, that’s a jerk–gets a farm, or loses
one, an’ that’s a jerk. With a woman it’s all one flow, like a stream,
little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman
looks at it like that.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Look at that ol’ coffeepot steam!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Maybe, but we shore takin’ a beatin’.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas
come up an’ they die, an’ their kids ain’t no good, an’ they die out.
But we keep a-comin’. We’re the people that live. Can’t nobody wipe us
out. Can’t nobody lick us. We’ll go on forever, Pa. We’re the
people.</p>
