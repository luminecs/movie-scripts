<h1 id="the-white-ribbon">the-white-ribbon</h1>
<p><strong>long shot of the riding stables.</strong>: The rider is the
village doctor, a gaunt, intellectual- looking man of around 60, who has
finished his dressage session, and now rides toward the open gate beside
the CAMERA, goes through it and into the landscape. We see him in the
avenue, now visible behind him, and watch him grow smaller until he
vanishes.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …to see if any of his patients had
arrived. As it entered the property, the horse had tripped over a hardly
visible, taut wire that had been strung between two trees. The doctor’s
fourteen-year old daughter had watched the accident from the window of
the house, and was able to inform the woman who was their neighbor, who
in turn got the message to the manor house, so that the agonizing doctor
could be transported to the hospital of the district capital that was
over 30 kilometers away…</p>
<p><strong>tracking shot:</strong>: Emilie Wagner, a skinny, modestly
dressed woman in her late thirties hurries along the village street.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …The neighbor, a single woman of around
40, was the village midwife, who had filled the invaluable position of
housekeeper and receptionist for the doctor since the death of his wife
in childbirth. After tending to the doctor’s two children, she had gone
to the school to fetch her own son, Hans. Since she didn’t like leaving
him alone, she asked me - in return for a small fee - to keep him at the
school with me every day, after the other children had finished their
lessons. But on the day of the riding accident there was choir practice
in the afternoon, so that most of the children were still present.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Were you at Xenia’s place?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Can’t you say hello? Good afternoon,
Mrs. Wagner, excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Hello, Marie.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We’re so worried, you know. That’s why Martin
forgot his manners.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: How is the Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Not very well.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Will he have to stay in the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We’ll take care of Xenia. Maybe, we can help
her somehow. MIDWIFE : Good idea. It’ll cheer her up.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Well, did you enjoy the singing? HANS : It
was great!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Show your mother what you’ve been
singing.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: La… La… lalala…</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Good-bye, Sir. Good-bye, Mrs. Wagner.</p>
<p><strong>georg</strong>: Last one is a rotten egg!</p>
<p><strong>4. the doctor’s house int/day</strong>: Xenia, who is herself
in a pitiful condition, holds her four-year-old brother Rudolph on her
knees. She rocks him and herself back and forth. As his head is bowed,
we can only guess that he’s crying. After a while</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Hush!</p>
<p><strong>georg</strong>: Hi, Xeni! MARIE: How are you? Can we help
you?</p>
<p><strong>5. manor ext/night</strong>: The steward of the estate, a
heavy set rustic man in his mid fifties, is talking with the landowner .
They are standing beside a team of carthorses. With a torch the steward
lights up a dead horse that lies on the ground after being towed in by
the carthorses.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: …its tendons were almost severed. It never
would have recovered.</p>
<p><strong>landowner</strong>: How did that thing get there? Didn’t the
Doctor say anything? STEWARD : He was in no mood to talk, with his
collarbone sticking out of his throat. I asked his daughter. She has no
idea. He always rides through those trees.</p>
<p><strong>landowner</strong>: Did you look at the wire?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Of course. It’s thin, but strong. You can
hardly see it, if you don’t look closely.</p>
<p><strong>landowner</strong>: But why was it tied there? STEWARD : And
at knee height! I don’t know… Maybe so the kids could jump over it. No
idea. I don’t think the doctor himself was stupid enough to tie that
thing there.</p>
<p><strong>landowner</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Meaning: I don’t know. Anyway it was
definitely put there intentionally and looks damn…</p>
<p><strong>6. manor. living room on the top floor. int/night</strong>:
Sigi, the 9-year old son of the landowner stands at the window, and
watches his father and the steward standing in the torchlight beside the
dead horse. In the background MUSIC . After a short while the two men
down in the courtyard separate: the landowner heads to the manor, the
steward with the team of carthorses to a farm building. Sigi turns away
from the window and looks into the room. There his mother Beatrix, a
beautiful, nervous woman in her late thirties, is sitting at a baby
grand piano. Beside her stands the tutor, holding a violin tucked under
his chin. He looks as if he’s in his late twenties, plump and slightly
greasy, and obviously infatuated with his beautiful employer, who has
just interrupted her playing with an annoyed sigh.</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: I’m sorry, Madame. You’re just playing too
well for me.</p>
<p><strong>beatrix</strong>: Stop apologizing and concentrate. That’ll
be more helpful for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: To tell the truth: You’re just playing too
fast for me. I’m not Paganini.</p>
<p><strong>beatrix</strong>: Well, let’s start all over again at the
letter D.</p>
<p><strong>beatrix</strong>: Listen, darling. If you like the music,
then sit down beside me and turn the pages of the sheet music. But if
you’re bored, go up to your room and at least stay out of my sight. It
makes me nervous if you’re constantly sauntering around in front of me.
BEATRIX : By the way, what time is it? Where is the girl?</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: She’s with the twins, I presume. Twenty to
nine.</p>
<p><strong>beatrix</strong>: Twenty to nine?! : You should have been in
bed long ago. : Has he done his homework?</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: Of course, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>beatrix</strong>: All right. : Well, do you want to turn the
pages for me or not?</p>
<p><strong>beatrix</strong>: Then come here! BEATRIX : All right, here
we go again: the letter D. Try to play a bit faster. Or else I might as
well play with the village schoolteacher.</p>
<p><strong>7. rectory. dining room. int/night</strong>: Marie and Martin
come through the door and stand in front of it. At the dinner table, the
pastor sits with his back to the door. In front of him, at the other end
of the table, sits his wife Anna, a woman in her late forties. On the
sides of the table sit the children: Anton , Magdalena , Katharina and
Florian . Two other places are empty. The table is set for 8 people, but
the plates are empty.</p>
<p><strong>silence.</strong>: MARIE : Please forgive us. MARTIN : Please
forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: There’s no question of forgiving. You
haven’t offended me. It’s your mother and your brothers and sisters that
you have frightened away and offended. Ask them for forgiveness. You
amaze me. I didn’t know that the two oldest and therefore most
reasonable of my children wouldn’t mind frightening their mother and
brothers and sisters to death.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: You probably agree with me, that I cannot
leave your offense unpunished, if we want keep living in mutual respect.
So, tomorrow evening at this hour, I shall give each of you 10 strokes
of the cane. Until then, you have time to ponder over your offense. Do
you agree with me? MARIE and MARTIN: Yes, Father.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: All right then. Go to bed now, all of
you.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: I refuse to be touched by you. Your mother
and I will sleep poorly because we know I have to hurt you tomorrow, and
because it will more painful to us than the strokes will be painful to
you. Leave us alone and go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: When you were small, your mother once in a
while would tie a ribbon in your hair or around your arm. Its white
color was to remind you of innocence and purity. I thought that at your
age you were well-mannered enough to get by without such reminders. I
was wrong. Tomorrow, once you’ve been purified by your punishment,</p>
<p><strong>8. the doctor’s property ext/day</strong>: CLOSE ANGLE: one
of the trees to which the wire was tied that tripped up the doctor’s
horse. A policeman is looking for clues. With him are Xenia, Rudolph,
the midwife and her son Hans. The two boys don’t show much interest in
the investigation. They run after each other in the garden and the
neighboring fields. Hans especially seems enjoy this, and is shrieking
with delight.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Where is the wire now?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Then who took it away?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You weren’t here?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Did you accompany your father? To
town?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: That means you were here.</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: I was in school. Today.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: And when you left for school, the wire
was still here?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: I didn’t check.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: And when did you come?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: At noon. I make lunch for the Doctor and
the kids. Since the death of the Doctor’s wife, I’ve been helping him
out.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: It’s been 4 years. Since the birth of
little Rudolph. I’m the midwife here. We often work together.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: But you didn’t see anything?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Do you have any idea how long the wire
had been there?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I’d never seen it before. POLICEMAN : Let
me get this straight: Nobody saw the thing before, nobody saw it
afterwards. It wound itself around the two trees all alone, and made
itself vanish after the doctor’s fall. Right?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Mother! … Look! …Look… come! MIDWIFE : What’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: People! …Lots of people. Come!! MIDWIFE :
Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The day following the doctor’s riding
accident not only brought no solution to the question of who’d done it,
but a second, far more tragic incident almost made people forget the
misfortune of the previous day: the wife of a tenant farmer died in a
work-accident.</p>
<p><strong>9. farm int/day</strong>: It’s very dark in the low-ceilinged
room. Small windows. A couple of women in peasant dresses take care of
the dead woman, who’s been laid out on the bed. The women remove her
clothes and wash her.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The woman, who because of an injured arm
could only do light work, had been dispensed</p>
<p><strong>bathing-midwife</strong>: You stay outside! I haven’t yet…
FARMER : Get out!</p>
<p><strong>10. a river and meadow with bridge ext/day</strong>: With his
net and his fishing rod the schoolteacher is landing a fish.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On the same day, I had a strange
encounter: the weather was beautiful and hot, so I decided to try and
improve my meager menu with some brown trout, which are plentiful in the
river. The landowner apparently liked me, and allowed me to fish.
SCHOOLTEACHER : Martin! SCHOOLTEACHER : Martin!!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Martin, be careful!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Are you completely insane? ! Do you
want to break your neck? ! MARTIN : Hello, sir.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What’s happening? Are you mad? !
Don’t you know how high that is?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Didn’t you hear me? I shouted to you.
MARTIN : Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well?!!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: You saw me down there and wanted to
impress me?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well, why didn’t you… MARTIN I gave
God an opportunity to kill me. He didn’t do it. That means, he’s pleased
with me. SCHOOLTEACHER : What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He doesn’t want me to die. SCHOOLTEACHER :
Who? Who doesn’t want you to die?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: God.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Why would God want you to die?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Please, don’t tell him! Please, sir,
don’t!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>11. sawmill int/day</strong>: Franz, the farmer eldest son,
is searching for evidence of his mother’s accident. He is accompanied by
the neighbor’s son Matti, a slight boy of around 16. The sawmill is a
ramshackle wooden building beside the river. Matti, who obviously was
there when the accident happened, shows Franz the place.</p>
<p><strong>matti</strong>: There. Be careful. Everything’s rotten
here.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: Who made her climb up here?</p>
<p><strong>matti</strong>: I haven’t a clue. They told us to collect all
the lose ends. She just climbed up there.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: She could never stand heights. It made her
dizzy. Who assigned you to this job? MATTI : You know how it works. The
sawmill needed to be cleaned up, and the foremen pick the weaker
harvesters</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: Who picked her?</p>
<p><strong>12. street at the end of the village ext/day</strong>: . The
schoolteacher with his fishing gear and several fish that he caught.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was on my way home after the strange
encounter with Martin that I met Eva for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Hello. EVA : Hello. SCHOOLTEACHER :
Excuse me! EVA : Yes? SCHOOLTEACHER : Excuse me for accosting you this
way. You’re the new nanny of the Baron’s children, aren’t you? EVA :
Why?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: They say you’re from Oberdorf.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Who says that?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Folks around here.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Oh. So what?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Nothing. I don’t know. Sorry. I’m the
schoolteacher here. I just thought I… I don’t know : when I saw you, I
thought… I’m from Grundbach… I’m the tailor’s son…</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I know. SCHOOLTEACHER : What?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: The Baroness already told me.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What did she tell you?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: That the schoolteacher is from the village next
to mine. SCHOOLTEACHER : Oh, I see! Yes. Well… I thought… : You look as
if you’re going there…</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Back home. To Oberdorf. EVA :
Yes?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Are you going there?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Yes, I am. SCHOOLTEACHER : Well, I thought…
since you’ll cycle through our village… you might perhaps… : … say hello
to my father and bring him one of the fishes. They’re fresh. I just
caught them.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: What?! SCHOOLTEACHER : Well. I’m sure he’d be
delighted. Especially as it’s the start of the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Well, how…</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I don’t know either. Unfortunately, I
have nothing to wrap them in.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Neither have I. Unfortunately. SCHOOLTEACHER :
I could give you some fishing line, to tie them up. EVA : There on the
bicycle?!</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I don’t think that’s a very good idea.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: You’re right. It was just an
idea.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Is that your bicycle? EVA : No! It
belongs to the estate.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Is this your first day off? EVA :
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well, you’re probably looking forward
to being at home.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I can imagine. EVA says : Well. I’ve
still a long way to go. SCHOOLTEACHER : Of course. Well, good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Good-bye. SCHOOLTEACHER : If you cycle through
Grundbach and see my father, at least say hello to him from me.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I don’t know your father.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I only learned to ride a bicycle today!
SCHOOLTEACHER : Well, you’re doing fine! But be careful! As she picks up
speed, Eva rides better and soon is just a speck on the dusty country
road.</p>
<p><strong>13. the doctor’s house int/dusk</strong>: It’s still too
early to switch on the light. Xenia and little Rudolph are sitting in
the kitchen, eating. For quite a while. Suddenly</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: The woman today. What was wrong with her?
XENIA : Which woman? Oh, I see. She was dead.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: What’s dead? My God, that’s when someone
doesn’t live anymore. When he’s stopped living.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: When does one stop living?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: When you’re too old or very ill.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: And the woman?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: She had an accident.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: An accident?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes. That’s when you hurt yourself very
badly.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: Like Dad?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes, but much worse than that. So bad, that
your body can’t take it anymore. Another SILENCE: Then</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: And then you’re dead?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes. But most people don’t have an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: That means they don’t need to die?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: No, they die much later.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Later, when they’re very old.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: Do all people die?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: All of them, really?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes, everyone dies.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: But not you, Xeni?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Me too. Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: But not Dad?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Dad too.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: Me too?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: You too. But not before a very very long
time. All of us, only in a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: And you can’t do anything against it? It
has to happen?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: It has to happen. But not now, not for a very
long time.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: And Mom? She didn’t go on a trip?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: RUDOLPH: Is she dead too?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: XENIA: Yes. She’s dead too. But that was a
long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>14. rectory. dining room. int/night</strong>: While we hear
the SOUNDS of the punishment and the children being beaten, COUNTING the
strokes with increasing MOANS and stifled WHINING, we see the faces of
the other brothers and sisters. Some have turned away their faces, and
others start to cry with pity and fear. Finally both have received their
10 strokes.</p>
<p><strong>close angle</strong>: The pastor. He is breathless and beads
of sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>close angle</strong>: Marie. You know how much I love you and
how much it hurts me to inflict such pain on you. Today was a very sad
day in my life, and I hope for all of us that it doesn’t happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>close angle</strong>: Both kiss their father’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>close angle</strong>: The pastor. PASTOR : And now hug me.
There’s nothing we have to forgive each other anymore. I love you with
all my heart.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Now the ribbon, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: This will remain on you until we’re all sure
you have learned how to fight bad thoughts and manners. You’re well
aware, this year you will receive Christ’s body in the form of bread and
wine. Until then, strive to be free of sinful thoughts. Now let’s eat.
PASTOR : Marie, would you say grace today? MARIE : With pleasure,
father.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Come Lord Jesus and be our guest And bless
what you’ve given to us.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Amen. Blessed be this meal.</p>
<p><strong>the others</strong>: Blessed be this meal.</p>
<p><strong>15. farm int/night</strong>: The body of the farmer’s wife
has been laid out. The candles to its left and right are almost burnt
out. Its very quiet. Little five-year old Sepp sneaks into the room,
bare- foot and wearing a shirt. He hesitates. Then, slowly and
carefully, he comes over to his dead mother. He ends up standing beside
the bed. The face of the dead woman is covered with a white
handkerchief. Sepp is very frightened. He makes several attempts before
he dares to lift the handkerchief. Then he watches her, breathless, his
eyes and mouth wide open. Suddenly, startled by a noise, he jerks back.
He turns around: his 14-year old brother Paul is sitting on a bench
against the wall. He too only wears a shirt. Paul doesn’t say a word.
Sepp doesn’t know what to do. He looks at his mother again, then again
at his brother. He goes over to him and sits beside him on the bench.
Like birds in a cage, they remain seated in the dark. Very close
together.</p>
<p><strong>int/night</strong>: The steward and his children Liesl ,
Georg and Ferdinand ] are waiting for something. Then the door opens and
the midwife comes out. She tells them to come into the other room.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: That night, the wife of the steward gave
birth to her fourth and last child at the age of 42. LIESL : What is it?
MIDWIFE : Well, what do you think? LIESL: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: It’s a boy.</p>
<p><strong>ferdinand</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: What do you mean?! Don’t you want a
brother?</p>
<p><strong>ferdinand</strong>: Pff!</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: You’re lucky your father can’t hear
you.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: You should be ashamed. FERDINAND :
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>17. track near the farm ext/dawn</strong>: The farmer, Franz
and Paul leave the farm, they go to work. The two oldest carry scythes.
In the background vast fields of crops. The three walk hurriedly. After
a while</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: I went to the sawmill. The floor, on the
first level, where mother worked, was totally rotten. The steward, who
sent her there, must have known it. And the landowner too. Father?!
FARMER : What do you want? FRANZ : They sent her there knowing it was
dangerous. FARMER : What are you getting at? FRANZ : But…</p>
<p><strong>franz: i…</strong>: FARMER: Go and cut off his head of with
your scythe. Sure, that’ll bring your mother back to life. FRANZ : I
think our father loved our mother.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>close angle</strong>: Paul. He was listening carefully the
whole time. He looks at the father. Then, lowers his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: After these two days in July, life in the
village returned to what it had always been…</p>
<p><strong>18. montage ext/ins./day/night</strong>: Harvesting. Even
teenagers and children are used to tie the sheaves and to do other
easier jobs.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: … The daily harvesting drove the people
almost to exhaustion. Most of the children were busy helping their
parents.</p>
<p><strong>19. manor ext/day</strong>: NARRATOR: … until the harvest
festival at the end of the summer brought the whole village</p>
<p><strong>harvester</strong>: …with our songs and our prayers We’ve
gathered the rye and given that crown to your lordship. It is not big,
it is not small, But pretty, nice and fine. Not with thistles or thorns
is it made, but with pure grain. Had our lordship sowed more, The men
would’ve scythed more And we girls gathered more. We girls have gathered
the grain, Over mountains and valleys, Over thistles and thorn, Over the
fields of our lordship. I wish our lordship a happy life, As many years
as there’s sand on the beach As many years as there are drops in the
rain So much may our lordship be blessed. And as a reward to be of good
cheer We’d like for our folks a barrel of beer, And if we could have a
fried goose perchance Then we’ll all be ready to dance. BARON: My thanks
to all of you. Thank you very much. You have worked well and the heavens
were merciful, and now the barns are full. Therefore there’s more than
enough beer, and you won’t starve today.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Enjoy your meal!! Eat and drink as much as
you wish. You deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>20. vegetable garden of the manor ext/day</strong>: The
vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house. In the distance we
hear the MUSIC from the feast. Franz, in working clothes, comes over,
opens a gate in the fence, then goes to a large field with the cabbages
and slices them all off with his scythe. The whole scene looks like a
mass execution.</p>
<p><strong>21. estate ext/day</strong>: The party is in full swing:
people dance and shout, children run around, young men quarrel and show
off in front of the young girls. Older women are stand around in groups,
gossiping. Some farmers are gathered around the landowner � he is
friendly with them, but we don’t understand what they’re talking about.
His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of place in this crowd.
She’s talking to the schoolteacher.</p>
<p><strong>beatrix</strong>: …didn’t you promise us a little chorale
sung by your prot�g�s.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: You have to talk to the pastor,
Baroness. We’re still busy studying the choir pieces for the
confirmation feast. BEATRIX : But that’s in spring, my dear. This is the
start of autumn. SCHOOLTEACHER : I know, but unfortunately not all of
our little singers are very musical. I’m sorry if…</p>
<p><strong>22. estate. under the lime tree . ext/day</strong>: A quieter
part of the estate. Under a big shadowy tree, we see the two strollers
of the landowner’s family, a small table and a few chairs. Eva is
sitting beside the twins and watches the colorful bustle. Sitting beside
her, turning her back to the manor, is Emma, the steward’s wife who is
breastfeeding her baby. The steward separates from a group of men and
comes over to the two women. As he comes over, he shouts to them:</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Well, you two “mothers”? Don’t you want to
be part of the festivities?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It’s so nice here in the shade. STEWARD :
Well, our son seems to be enjoying that, right?!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: I can imagine. Who wouldn’t like that. EMMA
: Georg! STEWARD : What about you? Don’t you get bored taking care of
other people’s children, with all the young lads over there? EVA : No
Sir, I love to be with the children. How old are you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Eighteen, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Eighteen! And you want me to believe you’d
rather hold the Baroness’s baby in your arms than your true love? EMMA :
Come on, Georg, leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: I’m not doing her any harm. Can you get us
something to eat, Emma? EVA : If you mind the children for a moment,
I’ll get us something. STEWARD : Don’t worry, princess, I’m going. Not
to panic.</p>
<p><strong>ext/day</strong>: A bunch of children between 5 and 15,
dressed up in their Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, both
wearing their white ribbons, the pastor’s other</p>
<p><strong>24. estate. outside the barn. ext/day</strong>: Farmhands and
tenant farmers are eating at the tables. One of them tells a story, that
we only partially understand because of all the noise:</p>
<p><strong>first tenant farmer</strong>: …so the guy really tried to
steal the rooster from the steeple. He was already completely pickled,
but even then they couldn’t stop him. A huge, massive guy, you see. So
they just let him go, saying to themselves: if he falls down, he falls
down, that’s it. But he didn’t get much farther than the first window,
that’s where the trellis ends, see. And even with all his strength, he
couldn’t hoist himself up on the lightning rod. So the guy stands up
there in the window. And what do you think that idiot does: he starts to
crow! He crows, shouting: I’m the rooster on the steeple. You’ll never
catch me! He made such a commotion that little by little the people in
the neighborhood started to wake up…</p>
<p><strong>leni</strong>: I’m coming. I haven’t got a magic wand. FIRST
FARMHAND : Shall I help you, Leni? I’d love to help you. SECOND FARMHAND
: What do you want to help her with?!</p>
<p><strong>laughter.</strong>: FIRST FARMHAND: All over. Front and
backside.</p>
<p><strong>second tenant farmer</strong>: Come on, leave her alone</p>
<p><strong>second farmhand</strong>: You like her that much? Go and help
her. FOURTH FARMHAND : Don’t you know: it was her mother who had that
accident?…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Father, they cut off the Baron’s cabbages.</p>
<p><strong>first tenant farmer</strong>: What’s that? BOY : They cut off
the Baron’s cabbages.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I never learned it. SCHOOLTEACHER : Neither did
I. You just have to count out loud. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three.
One…</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Aren’t you afraid your students might laugh at
you, when they see you dancing with me that way, sir. SCHOOLTEACHER :
They’d better not! And stop being so formal with me. I’m not that old,
am I?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One. Two.
Three. One. Two. Three.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: You see: we’re getting better.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Stop looking at your feet.</p>
<p><strong>26. vegetable garden ext/day</strong>: MUSIC of the village
band can be heard coming from the manor. The Baroness reaches the
vegetable garden, followed by the pastor’s wife, the tutor and some
“ladies” from the village. Behind the fence, among the “beheaded”
cabbages are the Baron, the steward and some farmers. A couple of
curious onlookers have gathered by the fence. Mutters, and now and then
laughter. The Baron turns to his wife and, with a snicker, points to the
“heads” lying around him.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Quite a job, isn’t it?!</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: This is disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: It used to be an old custom : “Now that the
harvesting’s done,”It’s time to pay us, every one, “Any miser who leaves
us in a rut,”He shall have his cabbage cut.</p>
<p><strong>27. rectory. study. int/dusk</strong>: The pastor works at
his desk. Suddenly a KNOCK on the door Florian comes hesitantly through
the door.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: What do you want? FLORIAN : I’d like to ask
you something, Father.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: I have found it. It’s wounded.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: What do you want? FLORIAN : May I keep
it?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: How do you plan to do that?</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: We’ll heal it. PASTOR : And when it’s
healed? Don’t you think, you’ll be attached to it then? Will you let it
fly away?</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: “Pipsi” also lives in a cage.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Yes, but Pipsi grew up in captivity. : This
one is used to living in freedom. PASTOR : Will you set him free, as
soon he’s healed?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Have you already asked Mother?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: And? What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: She said, it was for Father to decide.
PASTOR : That’s what she said?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: You’ll really to take care of it? That’s a
heavy responsibility. You know that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Well. You’re its father and mother now.
We’ll have to find a cage for your patient.</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: Thanks, Father!</p>
<p><strong>28. track to the farm ext/dusk</strong>: Leni comes along the
track, excited. She`s almost running. She reaches the farm and
disappears inside.</p>
<p><strong>29. farm. room. int/dusk</strong>: The family is eating.
They’re in working clothes, since they didn’t attend the Thanksgiving
feast. Only Leni, who visibly just came into the room, is still wearing
the clothes she wore at the feast. She’s out of breath and very excited.
The farmer looks very concerned. Franz doesn’t answer and keeps on
eating.</p>
<p><strong>leni</strong>: It seems somebody saw you. FRANZ : So what?
They should be glad that they still have their own heads. And I want you
to know this, Father: I’m proud of it! FARMER : Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: What did you intend to do?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Tell me. Come on. Tell me: FRANZ : You know
why, Father. FARMER : Because of your mother? Because you feel they’re
responsible for her death? Is that it? What do you think? That I’m not
man enough to settle this? It’s that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: And how do you know they’re innocent?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: But I don’t know the opposite either.</p>
<p><strong>30. manor. stairwell. int/night</strong>: The Baron stands at
the bottom and shouts up at the tutor who’s standing on the stairs:</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: …What do you mean “not there”? TUTOR : He…
disappeared. I`ve already looked everywhere. I can’t find him.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Nonsense. He can’t have vanished into thin
air. When did you see him last? TUTOR : Around 2 o’clock. BARON : Around
two? Do you know what time it is?! TUTOR : I know, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What does my wife say, doesn’t she have any
clue?</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: Madame sent me to you, Baron. She is beside
herself with fear. BARON : I can imagine. : You’re an idiot, Huber. Why
do you think you’re here? To take care of a single child! Is that such a
hard task? TUTOR : I’m awfully sorry, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You’re even too stupid for that.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Where did you see my son for the last
time?</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: Outside, in the courtyard. He said, he was
going to play with the other children.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: That he didn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: And my wife didn’t notice anything
either?</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: After that business with the cabbage heads,
Madame retired to her room. She was indisposed. BARON : Indisposed?!</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: Yes. She had a terrible migraine attack.
BARON : My God, this place is a zoo!</p>
<p><strong>back to the scene.</strong>: The torches of the feast have
almost burned out. Here and there we see some lanterns, put there to
facilitate the cleaning up. Coming from the front door, the Baron
crosses the vast courtyard. Half way across he screams:</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Br�ker!! BARON. Have you seen my son? STEWARD
: No. BARON : Could you please ask your boys. Apparently, Sigi has
disappeared with a whole bunch of kids.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Immediately. : When you’re finished with
the cleaning up, wait for me. There’s still a job to do. Get some fresh
torches and lanterns!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: In the meantime I’ll go round up the men.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The steward’s children said, they had seen
Sigi only for a short time, that he had gone off with other kids, and
that they didn’t pay much attention to it…</p>
<p><strong>in the courtyard.</strong>: Many men of different ages with
lanterns and torches. The Baron makes a short speech and the steward
assigns the areas to be searched. Most of this is drowned out by the
narrator’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …The search began shortly after midnight.
Before, the Baron had ridden to the Rectory. But there he found out
nothing new from the children who had been specially woken up.</p>
<p><strong>various landscapes: forest, field, river meadows.</strong>:
The search.</p>
<p><strong>in the courtyard.</strong>: The men come in with a
stretcher.</p>
<p><strong>33. church int/day</strong>: The room is packed. The whole
village is gathered.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The next Sunday, the Baron, at the end of
the service, asked the pastor if he could say a few words:</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You all know now what was done to my son
Siegmund. Policemen from the district town were here this week. They
questioned many of you. But to no avail. First I thought that the people
who tortured my child were the same people who cut off my family’s
“cabbage heads”…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Don’t run away, Felder. It’s your honor I
want to salvage. It has turned out that the valiant Franz Felder has
been boasting of his feat in front of his fianc�e. Then the coward that
he is, hid among his family, and so he didn’t have time to torture my
son. And there’s one thing I know for sure: the senior Felder would
rather bite off his tongue, than cover for his wayward son. May I remind
you something what most of you have already forgotten. Almost two months
ago, the doctor had a riding accident and he has still not returned from
the hospital. This accident was caused by a wire that had been strung in
his garden with the explicit intent of bringing him down. And in that
case too, nobody knows anything, saw anything or heard anything.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The landowner’s speech frightened the
people. Most knew about the incident at the Thanksgiving feast. But the
majority didn’t know exactly what had happened, and in the end they
didn’t care. The Baron was not really popular among the people, but he
was respected as a powerful social figure, as well as the employer of
nearly the whole village.</p>
<p><strong>back to the scene.</strong>: The people are leaving the
church, groups are forming. As the farmer Felder and his children come
out, they’re shunned. Gauntlet down the village street. The CAMERA
follows.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …His threat about loosing the peace of the
community couldn’t mean anything good. At the same time the mysterious
character of what were obviously criminal deeds fed the mistrust of the
farmers, deeply rooted since time immemorial.</p>
<p><strong>35. school. int/night</strong>: The empty classroom. On the
harmonium: a petroleum lamp. The schoolteacher is PLAYING. After a
while, someone knocks at the door. The schoolteacher stops.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What a question. Of course. Come in.
What happened.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Come over here. It’s so dark. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: They fired me.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Nothing. They just threw me out The tutor has
also been fired.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: The son of the Baron isn’t at all well. His
parents are angry and desperate. Now they say that it’s the tutor’s and
my fault, because we didn’t pay enough attention to him. But I’m only
there for the twins.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I know, come on. Stop crying!</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Where shall I go now? We need the money I was
earning here.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: You’ll find something else. Besides,
you know very well that the Baron is quick-tempered. With him, nothing
is ever as bad as it seems.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: : I’ll try to talk to her. A while
back, we played music together. : Unfortunately, I wasn’t very good. Now
she’s got the tutor, he plays better. As far as I know, he’s been
studying music in town.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: To beat a child that way.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Can I stay here tonight? Don’t send me away,
sir, please.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: How can you think something like
that?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I’ll just wait for the daylight to come. Here
in the classroom. Then I’ll leave.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Do you want me to come with you.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: And why should you do that, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Stop being so formal.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Come here, I’ll play something for
you. If you’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>36. farm. pigsty. int/ext/day</strong>: The farmer and Paul
are cleaning the pigsty which is not very big. The pigs grunt excitedly
because of the disturbance. Suddenly, Franz enters.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: Good morning, Father.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: I’m back again. They set me free.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: I can see that. So what?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: What do you want me to forgive for? That the
estate won’t give me any work now? That Leni has been fired in disgrace?
That your brothers and sisters soon won’t have anything to eat. Is that
what you mean? Or is it something else?</p>
<p><strong>37. country road and doctor’s property ext/day</strong>: The
CAMERA follows the carriage in which are Eva and the schoolteacher.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The next day, after school, I went to the
estate to inquire about Sigi’s health and to intercede for Eva’s
reinstatement. We were told the Baroness had left that morning with her
children. Reluctantly, the steward lent me a carriage to take Eva
home.</p>
<p><strong>stairwell.</strong>: DOCTOR : Rudi?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: He was in the living room a short time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: There’s nobody. They go into the
kitchen KITCHEN. Nobody. The look under the kitchen table, in the
pantry. Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Rudi? Where are you? DOCTOR : Hello, Rudi.
Don’t you want to say hello to your father? No?</p>
<p><strong>pause:</strong>: I heard you even wanted to visit me at the
hospital. And now you lock yourself in? All right. Then, I don’t want to
see you either. I’m going away now. You can stay in the toilet, if you
want.</p>
<p><strong>39. property the doctor’s ext/day</strong>: BACK TO THE
scene.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Why do you tell me that?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: I don’t know. I just thought you might want
to know.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: DOCTOR: Has she taken good care of you?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How old are you now?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s amazing how much you look like your
mother.</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>40. rectory. study. int/night</strong>: The pastor cleans the
cage of the small bird behind the desk and feeds the animal. As he does
it, he talks to</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Your mother and I are deeply worried about
you. Think about it. Are you sleeping badly? Are you overtired? MARTIN :
No.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Do you have problems in school that I don’t
know? MARTIN : No, Father.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: You probably don’t understand why we worry.
It comes from a sad experience I want to tell you briefly about: As you
know, I’m also acting as pastor for the communities of Birkenbrunn and
Hebern. In the latter place, some years ago, a mother came to see me.
She had noticed that her son, who was about the same age as you, and had
the same symptoms that you’ve been showing for some time. Although until
then the boy had been healthy and active, suddenly he showed a
noticeable weariness, he had dark rings under the eyes, seemed depressed
and joyless. The boy had also changed emotionally: before he had been
funny, frank, almost naughty, but now he became withdrawn. He tried not
to look his parents in the eye, and was caught telling small and even
big lies.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Do you understand now why I’m worried?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: So, according to you: what caused these
changes that led to the miserable end of this boy? MARTIN : I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: I think you know well.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Blushed? I don’t know… I felt sorry for
him.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Is that all? No, Martin, there has to be
another reason. It’s written on your face. Be sincere, Martin. Sincerity
brings you closer to God, our beloved Father, and to all human beings.
MARTIN : Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Well, Martin, why are you crying? Shall I
spare you that confession? You too have done what that wretched boy did,
haven’t you? MARTIN : Oh my God! Yes.</p>
<p><strong>41. the midwife’s house. living room. int/night</strong>:
Intercourse between the midwife and the doctor. She holds on to the
sideboard, as he penetrates her from behind. Both are fully dressed, she
has just lifted her skirt. When he is ready, she turns around and puts
her arms around him. He lets her do it, with a patronizing smile and
pulls gently away from her.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Careful, my arm.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: It’s great that you’re back. It was about
time.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You can say that. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: MIDWIFE: It was difficult with the children,
without you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: He doesn’t like me.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Rudi. DOCTOR : He’s at a difficult age.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Actually not. They’re always at a difficult
age. DOCTOR : Yes.</p>
<p><strong>long pause.</strong>: MIDWIFE: You didn’t miss me.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Come on. What are you saying?!</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Nothing. I said it because it’s the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: DOCTOR: There’s nothing like a nice dose of
self-hate.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Nothing. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>42. church ext/day</strong>: It’s snowing. From the inside of
the church, we hear the children’s choir: CHILDREN :</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Winter came early that year. At the
Reformation feast on the first Sunday of November, a deep blanket of
snow covered the village. The Baron, who had come back without his
family, didn’t attend, which was very unusual for him…</p>
<p><strong>43. church int/day</strong>: IMMEDIATE BACK TO THE scene. The
community celebrates the Reformation Feast. The schoolteacher conducts
the children’s choir. The children sing enthusiastically. Marie and
Martin wear the white ribbon on their arm.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …The villagers took that as a sign of his
anger. Indeed, no evidence had been found as to the possible author of
the crime, although the Baron’s appeal had led to a flood of mutual
suspicions, even to some attempts of denunciation that had all turned
out to be untenable.</p>
<p><strong>44. the steward’s house. int/night</strong>: The doctor
examines the steward’s baby that is crying. Finally, he turns to the
parents.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, it’s not pneumonia. But you must be
careful. If his temperature rises, call me again. For the time being you
must give these drops every two hours. And hang some wet sheets over the
oven. That facilitates breathing.</p>
<p><strong>room.</strong>: How long has the window been open?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Difficult to say. My wife nursed him at
about one o’clock. When she came back, it was around half past two. At
that time it was icy cold in this room.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: And the baby didn’t cry?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: No. The children were upstairs and didn’t
hear anything either. DOCTOR : He’s doing all right, considering the
circumstances. We have to wait. For now we’ll have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Can I offer you something to warm you
up?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No, thanks. I’m overloaded with work. When
one has been away for so long…</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Georg! And how is your arm doing?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s all right. Everything will be fine in
two or three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: That must be terrible, I imagine. You
probably feel like half a man when you can’t use your arm properly.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Good night, Doctor. DOCTOR : Thank you. If
your wife thinks that the baby…</p>
<p><strong>ferdinand</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>georg</strong>: What do you mean “well”? FERDINAND : I mean!
That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: LIESL : When did you go down to see Father?
Down in his office.</p>
<p><strong>ferdinand</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Just asking.</p>
<p><strong>45. snow-covered country road ext/day</strong>: The
schoolteacher, a rucksack on his back, walks through the snow which is
only furrowed by some carriage tracks.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In mid-December, I finally got a letter
from Eva. Her father had found her a new job in the district capital,
which she would start at the beginning of the New Year. Since that
night, where she had come looking for shelter in the school and we had
tried to tell each other the story of our short lives until the wee
hours of the morning, I could no longer banish from my thoughts her pale
face, her shy but frank personality and her shining hair red. The school
holidays lasted until the morning after New Year’s Day, but already the
second day after Christmas � the weather was cold but sunny � I went on
my way to Obersdorf in order to visit Eva and her parents.</p>
<p><strong>46. the horse-trader’s living-room int/day</strong>: A lower
middle-class room. The schoolteacher sits in front of Eva and her
siblings, 6 children between 14 and 6, mostly red-haired like Eva.
Embarrassed silence. The younger children whisper and giggle. The
conversation is slow. After a long pause</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I don’t know. The Baroness isn’t back
yet.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: And the Baron? SCHOOLTEACHER : We hardly see
him. He talks to nobody. I don’t know. Some say they’ve gone to the
south. To Italy.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: To Italy? Really.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: They now want to tear down the
sawmill for good. That’s what the steward says. Because it isn’t
worthwhile to…</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Good morning, young man.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Please be seated. We’re not very formal
here. FATHER : Scram!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Would you like something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: No, thank you. Very kind.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Really. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: So you’re a schoolteacher.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Can you afford to have a wife?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: My father works as a tailor in
Grundbach. I have an apprentice’s diploma. So I earn quite a bit on the
side</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You should have taken over your father’s
business, that would have been smarter.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: Well. And why are you so focused on that
girl? She’s almost still a child. You could almost be her father.
SCHOOLTEACHER : I’m thirty-one. FATHER : Well, you can still handle what
matters. MOTHER : Father!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Let’s be serious: do you know whether she’s
willing to get married. She’s still a child. She hasn’t seen anything of
the world. To Eva: Say something. Do you want him?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Come on. Don’t make such a fuss. He walked
all the way over through the fresh snow.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Why don’t you leave her alone. Of course,
she wants him. Can’t you feel that?!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How can I? If she keeps her mouth shut!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Just sit down. That’s how women are. A bit
hysterical, the whole lot of them. Listen. I’m not a big talker. On one
hand, it suits me for the girl to leave the house. We have a lot of
mouths to feed, as you can see.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I actually thought I… FATHER : I
know, I know. But it’s either that or nothing. You get it? SCHOOLTEACHER
steps back: If you insist…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: That’s it. I’m pleased. Well, business is
waiting. Even on holidays. I’ll send the girl back in so that you can
say good-bye. A year goes by fast. The world won’t collapse. And during
your holidays you can come and visit her. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: SCHOOLTEACHER says: Did your father
tell…?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that all right with
you?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: EVA: Is that all right with you, sir?
SCHOOLTEACHER : Don’t be so formal with me.</p>
<p><strong>47. rectory. the boys’ bedroom. int/night</strong>: It is
dark. Martin, Anton and Florian, whom we don’t recognize at first
glance, are lying in their beds. Through the window, a red glow, slowly
getting stronger. Suddenly</p>
<p><strong>martin’s voice</strong>: Toni! Are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>martin voice</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>anton’s voice</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>martin voice</strong>: Look! Look what’s happening out
there!!</p>
<p><strong>anton’s voice</strong>: My God, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>martin voice</strong>: Over there!! Have a look out of the
window!!</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Something is burning! Over there at the
estate!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Untie me!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Come on, untie me! I told you to untie
me!!</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll beat you black and blue, if you don’t
untie me!</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: What’s happening? Why can’t you be
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Flori, come over and untie me!</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: What’s going on? MARTIN : Untie me,
dammit!! You idiots! It’s burning!!</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: It’s burning? It’s burning! MARTIN : OK,
it’s burning! Now untie me, godammit!</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: But Father hasn’t allowed it… MARTIN : But
if there’s an emergency, you idiot. Somebody must warn them! loudly:
Faaaather!! Mooooother!! Father!</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Stop shouting. I’ll untie you.</p>
<p><strong>florian</strong>: Shall I call Mother?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s burning!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I know. Your father has already gone.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What are you doing here? : You all go to bed
now. It’s nothing. There’s a fire on the estate. You don’t need to be
afraid. Go to bed and sleep. Come on, Marie, take your sisters with you
and go to your room. Otherwise you’ll catch a cold. Why did you make so
much noise? You woke us all up!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I thought it was dangerous. ANTON : I had to
untie his hands. MOTHER : Now, everything’s all right again. Tomorrow,
Father will tell you what happened with the fire. All right? Now you</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Good night then. Sleep well.</p>
<p><strong>martin, anton, florian</strong>: Good night, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot.</strong>: A big barn is blazing fiercely.
SOUNDS of the FIRE. Against it we see, as silhouettes, the Baron, the
steward and his wife, the pastor, and all those, who are vainly trying
to save thing.</p>
<p><strong>49. the steward’s house int/night</strong>: In the children’s
bedroom, lit by the reflection from the nearby flames: Liesl, Georg and
Ferdinand. They stand at the window and stare into the flames.</p>
<p><strong>50. farm buildings /ext/day</strong>: Paul discovers his dead
father in the pigsty. The farmer has hung himself up from a hook in the
wall. The knocked-over stool still lies beneath his dangling feet. Paul
runs from the stable out to the courtyard. He stops. Then he tiptoes
toward the stable door. As he touches the stable door, he lacks the
strength to go inside again. Slowly he heads for the living room. The
children, who are gathered, pay no attention to him. Leni, who’s
cooking, has looked up from her work briefly. Paul sits down on the
bench against the wall. It is quite dark in there.</p>
<p><strong>51. the doctor’s house. office. int/day</strong>: The doctor
sits at his desk, the midwife sits on the visitor’s chair opposite him.
She tries to masturbate him.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Wouldn’t it be better if you stopped doing
that?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Why all the effort? Don’t look at me so
dumbfounded. It’s not that you lack talent… It’s just that I can’t do it
with you any more, that’s all. To tell you the truth: you disgust
me.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Are you through?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: : Yes, I have been for ages.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: You must be very unhappy to be so mean.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Oh God! Please, not that routine!</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I know that I’m not much to look at. My bad
breath comes from my stomach, you know that very well. But it didn’t
bother you in the past when we got together. I already had my ulcer when
your wife was still alive.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Please spare me these sordid details. But
let me reassure you: it has always disgusted me. I accepted it, because
I wanted to ease my pain after Erika’s death and I didn’t care with
whom. I could have screwed a cow. Whores are unfortunately too far from
here and regrettably once every two months isn’t enough for me, even
though I’m getting older. So skip your damn martyrdom routine and get
out.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: MIDWIFE : Why did this only occur to you
now?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: According to you: when should it have
occurred to me? At the hospital, I had forgotten how tiresome you were.
One grows sentimental when one’s in pain.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: DOCTOR : Get out. Why don’t you get out.
Don’t you have any pride? MIDWIFE : There’s no room for any with
you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Aren’t you afraid that I might do something
silly? DOCTOR : Go ahead. At least that would surprise me. But be
careful: it might be painful.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I know. I’m ridiculous. You wouldn’t care
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Why do you despise me? For helping to raise
the boy? For watching you fingering your little daughter and not saying
a word?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That’s it. Now leave me alone. I’ve got work
to do.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: You can’t afford to get rid of me. Who
would do the dirty work for you, who would help you with the children,
and here in you practice? You’re not speaking seriously. You just want
to see how far you can go, don’t you: will she still put up with it or
can I drag her even lower through the mud?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: My God, why don’t you just die?!</p>
<p><strong>52. farm. ext/day</strong>: Rays of cold winter sun. The men
carry the coffin out of the house. Some people are already waiting
outside. All wear mourning clothes. The coffin is shouldered, the
funeral procession forms, with the pallbearers and in the lead. The
others who had gathered in the house follow. Paul comes out with Sepp,
whom he tries to calm. Finally Leni comes out and, in</p>
<p><strong>53. village and surrounding landscape ext/day</strong>:
Various long shots of the snow-covered landscape.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The year was coming to an end with fine
weather. The sun made the snowy landscape sparkle so brightly that it
hurt the eyes. None of us suspected that it would be the last time a
year moved on to the next in an era of peace, and that that same year a
radical change would take place of which no one had the faintest
inkling…</p>
<p><strong>54. rectory. living room. int/day</strong>: The decorated
Christmas tree. Outside bright sunlight. The pastor is taking the white
ribbon off Marie’s head and Martin’s arm. The rest of the family
witnesses this almost solemn act.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Despite of the strange events, that had
unsettled the village, we thought of ourselves as united in the belief
that the life in our community was God’s will and worth living.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: … I take of this ribbon from you, in the
belief that from now on you’ll no longer need it. You, Marie, will be
accepted this year as a full member of the church community. You will
receive</p>
<p><strong>55. estate ext/day</strong>: Springtime. The Baroness, Sigi
and a new, a forty-ish nanny with the twins are get out of a carriage in
front of the manor.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Shortly after Easter, in the last week of
April, the Baroness came back with the children. She was accompanied by
a new nurse. Thus my secret hope that Eva would be able to come back
here, had definitely been dashed. The nurse was a chubby, middle-aged
Italian who came, as everybody soon learned, from the town on the
Mediterranean coast where the Baroness had spent the winter.</p>
<p><strong>ferdinand’s voice</strong>: Sigi!</p>
<p><strong>sigi</strong>: Hi, Ferdinand!</p>
<p><strong>ferdinand</strong>: Wait! I’m coming down!</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: Stay here, Sigi, you can see him later.
NURSE : Let him go, Signora! He’s so happy to be home again. BARONESS :
All right, you can go. But don’t stay too long. BARON : Beatrix?
Beatrix, where are you? NURSE : Sigi. Don’t you want to come say hello
to your father?</p>
<p><strong>classrooms.</strong>: The children are going wild. Brawling,
sponge and chalk are flying through the air. Some are packing up their
belongings, preparing to leave the classroom. In short, the way children
behave once the lesson is over. Marie stands at the classroom door. She
watches her classmates. The she looks through the door into the</p>
<p><strong>corridor.</strong>: It’s empty. She comes back to the
CLASSROOM, but stays at the door so that she can still keep an eye on
the corridor. Apparently, she has been posted there as a lookout to warn
against the possible arrival of a teacher. The shouting, laughter and
brawling goes on. Suddenly, Marie sees the schoolteacher in the CORRIDOR
with her father. The two are having an animated conversation. Marie
bursts into the CLASSROOM and closes the door to muffle the noise, then
she shouts to her classmates:</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Watch out, he’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>quiet!!!!</strong>: At that moment, the door opens and the
pastor comes in with the schoolteacher. Almost instantly, the room
becomes QUIET. Without saying a word, the pastor goes over to Marie,
grabs her by the ear and drags her through the whole classroom to the
stove, where he makes her stand, face to the wall. The pupils remain
silent, embarrassed. While the pastor goes back to the black board,
putting his briefcase on the desk without saying a word, the
schoolteacher, who feels slightly responsible for the lack of discipline
of his classroom, says:</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What’s going on here? Why are you
still here? You know that there’s a confirmation class now! Get out! How
about saying good-bye? Good-bye, Sir! Good-bye, Pastor!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I’m sorry, Pastor. It won’t happen
again. Good-bye, Pastor.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Good-bye. Let us pray. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>stairwell.</strong>: The only light comes in from the living
room. Rudolph comes down the stairs, wearing a nightshirt. He goes into
the LIVING ROOM. It’s empty. He goes into the KITCHEN. It’s also empty.
Rudolph is desperate. He starts to cry. Finally, he goes back to the
STAIRWELL and goes up the stairs to his room. On the stairway, he
notices light coming from under the door of the practice. He goes back
down the stairs down again and opens the door of the PRACTICE. In the
bright light, sitting in front of each other, are the doctor and Xenia.
The doctor has his back to Rudolph, so that we see Xenia’s face first.
She sits on</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: What are you doing here? Why aren’t you in
bed?</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: I can’t get to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: That’s why you’re wandering around like a
ghost in the middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: I woke up and you weren’t there. XENIA :
Dad has pierced my earlobes.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes, a bit.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: That’s why you’re crying? XENIA : I’m not
crying any more. DOCTOR : Beauty has to suffer. That’s what they say. At
least for girls…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now go to bed again. You too, Xeni.</p>
<p><strong>xenia</strong>: Yes. I haven’t worn earrings for a long time,
that’s why my earlobes grew back again. For Whitsun feast, when we all
want to look our best make ourselves look beautiful, I’m getting new
earrings. The ones that Mom had, with garnets…</p>
<p><strong>58. rectory. the pastor’s study. int/day</strong>: Marie
comes in. She’s wearing a nightshirt, her hair is damp and sticks to her
head. She looks sick and feverish. She closes the door quietly, then
goes to her father’s desk and opens a few drawers. She ends up finding
the letter-opener. It has a hilt and looks like a small sword. She takes
the letter-opener, goes to the birdcage, puts the letter-opener down
beside it and grabs the tiny canary. As the bird chirps, she glances
round at the door, as if to make sure that nobody is coming.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A few days after Marie’s fainting-fit that
frightened us all, and that was followed by her feverish and debilitated
state…</p>
<p><strong>59. estate. steward’s house. int/day</strong>: The
schoolteacher is led by the steward’s wife to the living room. She
carries an apron and her sleeves are rolled up. Apparently she was just
preparing a cake, and her sticky hands make her open the door with her
elbow. Because of the narrator’s voice, we don’t grasp what they’re
saying, but we understand that she’s asking him to come in and wait for
the person he wants to see, and that she can’t keep him company now.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …I went to see the steward, because I
wanted to borrow the carriage for the Whitsun holidays again. Since my
marriage proposal, Eva had written me once a week, and I got the feeling
that she felt lost and alone in the city, and was asking me between the
lines to come to see her again, despite of her father’s interdiction. I
wanted to spend Whitsun Saturday with her so that I could be back on
Sunday again and prepare the confirmation feast with the pastor. The
steward had gone to the sawmill, but was supposed to be back any minute.
His wife, who was busy preparing for Whitsun, asked me into the living
room and to wait there for his return.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Good morning, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Hello, Liesl..</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: He’s cute..</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Do you like him.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Yes. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: He was very sick last winter, I was
told.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Yes. Very sick. But the doctor cured him.
With God’s help.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Maybe, I’ll pop back this
evening.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: I’m sure Father will be back for coffee at
four.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Then, I’ll go sit down again next
door.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Can I bring you something? A cup of coffee.
I’m sure it’s ready. SCHOOLTEACHER : No, no. Thanks. I’ll sit down over
there again and just wait.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Can dreams come true?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: That depends, why? LIESL: On what?
SCHOOLTEACHER : On what does it depend? Well if you dream of getting the
first prize at the school feast, and study hard for it, then your dream
can come true. LIESL, shakes her head, quietly: That’s not what I
meant.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well, what did you mean then?</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: I mean, if you dream something in your sleep,
I mean, if you really dream it in your sleep, can it come true?
SCHOOLTEACHER : Why, what did you dream? Come on, tell me. You have
something on your mind, haven’t you? LIESL : I always dream such
horrible things. SCHOOLTEACHER : Tell me what you’ve been dreaming? Take
this. Now, calm down again. And then tell me what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: All right. Now go on.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: I dreamt that the Hansi � the midwife’s odd
little boy … SCHOOLTEACHER : I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: - …that something very bad is going to happen
to him.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Something very bad?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: I don’t know. Something like what happened to
Sigi not long ago. But even worse. But he’s so sweet. He harms no
one.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: All right. All right. That was just a
dream. You needn’t take it so seriously. LIESL : They always make fun of
him, because he doesn’t really… SCHOOLTEACHER : Yes, I know, but nobody
will do him any harm, you can be sure of that. Do you want my
handkerchief back?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What gave you the idea that your
dream would come true? SCHOOLTEACHER : Dreams don’t come true. Let alone
that kind. LIESL: But sometimes my dreams do come true.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: LIESL says: Last winter, before Putzl became
ill, I dreamt that my brother put him beside the open window, so that
he’d die. And the day the window was open and he caught a chill and he
almost died.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What are you saying there? That’s
complete nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Somebody probably didn’t close the
window properly. What gave you that idea? Why would your brother do such
a thing?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: And because you believe that, you
dreamt it. It doesn’t mean anything at all. It’s just a coincidence.
LIESL : All right.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Don’t tell such stories to anybody!
You obviously don’t realize the harm you can do with it. You didn’t tell
the story to your parents, didn’t you? All right then. Forget it
quickly. I shall forget it, too. Promise? Promise?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well. All right then. You don’t have
to worry. Nothing will happen to Hansi. : Nobody is jealous of him.</p>
<p><strong>60. rectory. the pastor’s study. int/day</strong>: The pastor
comes through the door, goes to his desk, and is about to put down his
briefcase. The dead bird lies in the middle of the desk with its wings
spread out. The pastor’s letter-opener is stuck in its neck - only the
hilt sticks out from its beak.</p>
<p><strong>61. street. ext/day</strong>: The schoolteacher and Eva drive
in the carriage. In the background, we catch glimpses of the town.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: We had arranged to meet at the town
railway station, since Eva wanted to avoid being seen with me. She was
living with distant relatives, who were apparently reporting regularly
to Eva’s parents about her life-style. She had become thinner which made
her even prettier, and once again I was ravished by her mixture of
shyness and almost childlike outspokenness. EVA : …“…You want your hair
parted r to the right or to the left?” “How about one parting to the
left and one to the right”? All the people in the saloon were laughing
their heads off. Even Mr. Murer, who’s so distinguished that he never
cracks a smile, had to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Then, it isn’t really so awful, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: No. But sweeping up hair all day � honestly the
twins were more fun, I must say. But it’s all right. I can’t really
complain.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: No. Really. SCHOOLTEACHER : And apart from the
twins, there’s nothing you’re missing?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Oh, you of course!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I don’t know. That’s what the steward
told me.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Over there, into the forest beside
the brook. We can picnic over there. I brought a basket of food. EVA : I
don’t want that. SCHOOLTEACHER : Why? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Nothing. Please.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: But I don’t want anything forbidden
from you. I just wanted you to enjoy the picnic.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Please. SCHOOLTEACHER : Do you think, I might
want to bring disgrace on my future wife? All right then. I’ll turn over
there.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>62. church int/day</strong>: The church is packed. The 8
candidates for confirmation are kneeling at the Communion bench. One
after the other, the pastor puts the cup to their lips.</p>
<p><strong>pastor:</strong>: Accept and drink! This is the blood of the
New Testament, Shed for the forgiveness of your sins.</p>
<p><strong>63. forest ext/night</strong>: Distant VOICES. At first
incomprehensible. Gradually we understand them better:</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Hansi? Where are you? Give us a sign! Hansi,
where are you? MAN’S VOICE: Over here. He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>corridor.</strong>: Marie, Martin, Paul, Georg, and a couple
of other children are waiting at the classroom door. They remain silent.
They’re listening.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: After this intricate atrocity committed on
the retarded boy, even the Baron was finally convinced that it would be
more intelligent to call upon the professional help of the county’s
police force. So a few days later a couple of plainclothes policemen
arrived and, after a visit to the several of the crime scenes, started
to ask in various homes if anyone had noticed anything suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: After learning of Hansi’s torture, I
didn’t think at first of what Liesl had told me. When it came back to my
mind, I at first hesitated to tell the authorities about it. Because of
such an absurd coincidence, I didn’t want to jeopardize the reputation
and inner peace of the steward’s family. But when I heard that Hansi
might loose his eyesight because of his injuries, one afternoon I made
Liesl come to school and tell the police officers about her dream.</p>
<p><strong>first police officer</strong>: …Thank God, we’re not as
stupid as you might think.</p>
<p><strong>first police officer</strong>: Now listen carefully! I’ll
give you a last chance: you tell me, who told you about the plan to
torture the boy, and we won’t tell anybody who told us. All right?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: She’s already dreamed of something
that has come true. FIRST POLICE OFFICER : Is that so? And what was it,
if I may ask? SCHOOLTEACHER : Something that happened in her family.
FIRST POLICE OFFICER : I see. Something to do with her family. And have
you checked if it was true? SCHOOLTEACHER : No. FIRST POLICE OFFICER :
Well, all that may be true. Maybe we’re really dealing here with an
authentic clairvoyant, and we don’t realize how lucky we are. Maybe we
only need to ask her, who’s behind all this. The we send her to bed, she
dreams a bit, and tomorrow she tells us who did it. How about that?
Everything’s possible, isn’t it? Stop crying!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>first police officer</strong>: Oooops! What do we have here?
CHILDREN : Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>first police officer</strong>: Why are you eavesdropping?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What do you want? MARIE strangers: We
wanted to ask you something about Hansi.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>65. the midwife’s house int/night</strong>: The doctor
carefully examines Hansi’s wounds. Especially the areas around eyes that
are badly affected. The boy moans softly. The midwife stands beside him,
trying to stay calm, but she is paralyzed with fear, and visibly still
in a state of shock. It’s very quiet. The doctor speaks with a soothing,
almost tender voice to the child, who keeps on moaning: He has finished
his treatment , and wants get up. But Hansi’s hand clings to his, and
holds him back. He hesitates a moment. The doctor and the midwife
exchange a brief glance. Then, the doctor cautiously frees his hand from
the child’s. The boy moans louder and tries again to grasp the hand of
the doctor, who he can’t see. Brief exchange of glances between the
doctor and the midwife, who ends up sitting on Hansi’s bed, taking the
boy’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: It’s all right, Hansi. Don’t be afraid. The
Doctor will be back.</p>
<p><strong>66. landscape with a brook and pastures ext/day</strong>:
Sitting at a brook, Sigi, Ferdinand and Georg have cut willow twigs with
their pocketknives and are now carving whistles out of them. Their feet
dangle in the water, they’re concentrated on their work. Georg is the
first to have finished. Proudly he tries it out, but the little whistle
doesn’t sound very good. He hides his disappointment, and keeps on
carving to improve the sound. Then Sigi’s whistle is ready and it sounds
very good. Sigi is delighted. After a short and proud look over to his
rivals, he leans back into the grass and keeps on whistling. Georg looks
with irritation at the “braggart”, and keeps on carving. Then he gives
it another try, but the whistle doesn’t sound much better than before.
Sigi’s whistling makes Georg’s seem ridiculous. Ferdinand looks at Georg
with a gloating grin.</p>
<p><strong>67. rectory. study. int/day</strong>: The pastor sits at his
desk, working. A KNOCK is heard.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Yes? PASTOR : What is it? What do you want?
FLORIAN : For Pipsi. : Because Father is sad.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the children’s room.</strong>: Georg stands at the window and
looks down at the</p>
<p><strong>the children’s room.</strong>: Georg leaves the window and
sits down at his table, doing his homework. We hear the FRONT DOOR
opening downstairs, then the father’s hasty STEPS on the stairs.
Finally, the father appears in the door. He’s out of breath, furious,
and tries to speak quietly</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Give me that whistle!</p>
<p><strong>georg</strong>: I beg your pardon? STEWARD : Give me that
whistle!</p>
<p><strong>georg</strong>: What whistle? Give it to me! GEORG : What
whistle?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Give away it to me, or I’ll kill you. GEORG
: I have no whistle.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: For God’s sake, Georg, what are you doing?
What has the boy done?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: For the last time: give it to me! GEORG :
But I don’t know what you mean, Father.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What’s going on? What are you talking about?
STEWARD : You know exactly what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But if he says so! Georg! What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>screams of pain</strong>: After a short hesitation, the
mother runs upstairs after her husband, and we now hear her trying in
vain trying to control her husband.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Georg! Please! Stop it! Don’t kill him…!</p>
<p><strong>69. estate. dining room. courtyard. int/ext/night</strong>:
The meal is over. The Baroness watches the maid clearing the table and
putting everything away on a tray. The Baron has stood up, standing with
his back to his wife. He pours himself a glass of brandy.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: … with the birches over there in Aigen that
should make about six-thousand cubic meters. Working steadily, they
should have finished it within three weeks. If until the end of the
month we… BARONESS : I won’t stay here. BARON : What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: I won’t stay here. BARON : What do you
mean</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: What I mean is that I shall leave with the
children.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What do you mean: you’re leaving with the
children?</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: Come on, Armin! It’s not that difficult to
understand, is it?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: BARON: May I ask you how you plan to do
that? BARONESS : I don’t know yet. But in any case, we’re leaving this
place. BARON : We.</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Good night, Baroness. Good night, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: I returned from Italy only out of deceny
toward you. I wanted to give us a chance. BARON : You wanted me “to give
me a chance”?!</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Well, that’s brilliant! And did I miss my
chance? Or what?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: BARONESS : Do you think that will help us
solve the problem?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: Your sarcasm.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Actually, what is the problem that has to be
solved? BARON : You stay here!! BARON : You only leave this room if I
tell you to do so.</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: I wanted to spare you this, but you force
me to do it: During our stay with Uncle Edoardo I fell in love with a
man. He’s from Lombardy, he works in the banking business and helped
Uncle Edoardo in a financial matter. He courted me and was also very
fond of the children. If Sigi has blossomed and grown so healthy, it’s
largely thanks to him. Despite all this, we came back. Because I feel
committed to you. But I can’t stand this place any longer. Not so much
for me personally, though I can’t say that life with you is exactly
thrilling for a woman of my age. But if I leave this place, it’s because
I don’t</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: BARON: Did you sleep with him? BARONESS :
You don’t understand anything.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Did you sleep with him?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: BARONESS : No. I didn’t sleep with him.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: BARON: You’re lying, aren’t you? BARON :
Come in!</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Good evening. Could I talk to you for a
moment, Baron? BARON : Can’t it wait until tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: It’s really urgent. Normally, I wouldn’t
have disturbed you so late.</p>
<p><strong>dining room</strong>: opens again. The Baron comes back
inside. He looks distressed. The Baroness doesn’t know whether this is
the result of her conversation, or of the message brought by the
steward. The Baron paces a few steps, pondering, then glances at his
wife. Finally, she asks</p>
<p><strong>baroness</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: They’ve shot the heir to the throne of
Austria. In Sarajevo.</p>
<p><strong>70. village and surrounding landscape ext/day</strong>: The
same setting as in Scene 57. The countryside in all its summer
splendor.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The news spread around the village like
wildfire. What would the consequences be? The first person who spoke the
word WAR, was severely contradicted. But once it had been uttered, it
remained at the center of all our thoughts in a curiously stubborn way.
I wanted to go to the town as quickly as possible, in order to discuss
it with Eva, what we should do if war broke out. Perhaps her father
would now agree to an earlier marriage. I asked the Baroness for the
bicycle, with which Eva had visited her parents some time ago. The
following weekend I planned use it to ride to town and see her.</p>
<p><strong>71. estate ext/day</strong>: The schoolteacher is pushing the
bicycle out of the manor house. He says good-bye to a maid, who closes
the door behind him. Some SHOUTING o.s. makes him look toward the
steward’s house: the steward comes out with the midwife, and it looks
like he’s throwing her out with a flood of angry insults.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: When I went to the estate on Friday
evening to pick up the bicycle, so I could take it with me to the
school, and get going early, as the trip was a quite long one, I
witnessed a strange confrontation:</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: …completely mad! Go if you want. He’ll
throw you out on your ear. Slandering other people and creating trouble.
That’s all we need now! Get out and never come back again! This is
unbelievable! Go ahead, do whatever you think you have to do! You’re
hysterical! MIDWIFE : …I’ll go to the Baron. We’ll see what he says. You
won’t silence me. Who do you think you are?! You’ll see. I’ll</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Good afternoon, Mrs. Wagner. What’s
happening? MIDWIFE : Good afternoon. Can I borrow your bicycle?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: It’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Could I borrow it just the same?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I just borrowed it myself. I going to
ride to town, to see my fianc�e..</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Please! Lend it to me!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Why do you need it? Where do you want
to go?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I must go to town.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I asked the steward for a carriage, but
that stubborn fool won’t agree to anything.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: Please! Lend me the bicycle.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Why? What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I have to go to the police in town. I now
know who committed all these crimes. SCHOOLTEACHER : Who?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Will you let me have the bicycle?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Why don’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: From now on I shall only talk to the
police. I won’t let them insult me : As you just saw.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Can’t the doctor can lend you his
horse?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I don’t know how to ride.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Please! Believe me! : My son told me who
did it to him. He may loose his eyesight. Please, you let me have the
bicycle!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The state that woman was in, who I knew
was level-headed, had deeply impressed me. What had her son told her,
that she didn’t dare tell anybody?</p>
<p><strong>72. village street. ext/dusk</strong>: The schoolteacher goes
home.</p>
<p><strong>tracking shot.</strong>: NARRATOR: With each step I took from
the estate back to the school, I felt more foolish for having given away
the bicycle. As I passed the midwife’s house, I saw Marie, Martin, and a
few other children in the garden.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Good evening, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Good evening, Marie.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Good evening, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We wanted to see how Hansi was doing.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: SCHOOLTEACHER: But can’t you see that the
shutters are closed.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Yes. We were worried. We saw Mrs. Wagner
riding off on a bicycle. So we wondered what had happened to Hansi.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: SCHOOLTEACHER: Go home now. Nobody said you
could come in here.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: You better go back home now,
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Good evening, Teacher. SCHOOLTEACHER : Good
evening.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Then I thought of Liesl’s dream again.
What if Liesl hadn’t dreamt, but had known, that Hansi was going to be
tortured. Whose crimes did she know of? Whose name had she refused to
reveal? The strong interest of the children in Hansi seemed strange to
me, considering that they had usually refused to have any contact with
him because of his disability, or only dealt with him in a rather
disdainful manner.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Hansi? Can you hear me? Hansi!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: If the midwife couldn’t take care of him,
she would have entrusted the boy to me, or to the doctor. But since the
night he was mistreated, I hadn’t seen him again. I decided to ask the
doctor directly.</p>
<p><strong>stairwell.</strong>: The pastor’s wife and the schoolteacher
stand before the closed front door.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: His daughter? Wasn’t she with you at
your school?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Yes, she was.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: And she didn’t say anything?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I have a request.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Could I ask Marie and Martin?</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: Don’t you want to wait for my
husband? He’s at the church. The service will be over in a quarter of an
hour. But if you insist. Please, come in.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: THE PASTOR’S WIFE: Don’t you want to sit
down? SCHOOLTEACHER : Yes. Perhaps. With pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: Can I offer you something? , : A cup
of coffee? Like during the piano lessons</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Yes, with pleasure. That’s very kind
of you.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Did you know that the Doctor was
leaving Eichwald?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: But you don’t seem surprised at my
question.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Our mother told us when she came to fetch
us.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: And Xenia didn’t tell you anything
about it?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No. SCHOOLTEACHER : Not a word? It’s very
unusual for a child not to tell his classmates before going away on a
trip. MARIE : Xenia never talks much about home.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well, that’s something completely
different?!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I get the feeling you’re hiding
something from me.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: That’s what I’d really like to
know.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: When you were looking for Hansi a
while ago, what did you want from him?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We were worried. He’s ill.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I’m asking Martin.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: MARTIN: Yes. He isn’t well. And since his
mother is gone… we thought, we should go and pay him a visit.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Did you ever ask yourselves who could
have treated Hansi that way? And Sigi?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: And who tied the wire in the doctor’s
garden? And who set fire to the barn? Well?!</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: MARIE: Yes, of course we wondered.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We discussed it with Father. He said it must
be a sick person.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Sigi was with you at Thanksgiving.
And so was Hansi.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: MARIE: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: What did they do to you? MARIE :
Who?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Sigi and Hansi? MARIE : Why?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: They obviously were being punished.
For what? MARIE : I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Liesl foresaw that Hansi would be
punished? What for? MARIE : I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: Why do you ask us?</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: SCHOOLTEACHER: You’re an intelligent girl,
Marie. Don’t try and play dumb.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: MARIE: I don’t understand you, Sir. You
should talk with Father about this or with Mother. Shall I go get
her?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Martin, would you please get her?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Stay here, Martin: I’ll talk to your
parents when I consider it’s the right time. Now, I’m talking to you.
And I expect you tell me the truth. Where were you on the evening Hansi
was found? MARIE : At home.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I mean after the confirmation?</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: There we are. The coffee will be
ready in a minute. Were the children able to help you?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I’m afraid not. They don’t know
anything, either.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: That’s really odd. A doctor can’t
vanish into thin air. What about his patients?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: No. I’m sorry if I disturbed you.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: Why don’t you stay? My husband will
be back any moment, and the coffee is almost ready.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: That’s very kind of you, but I’m
really worried about the midwife’s son.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: And she didn’t say when she’d be
back?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I didn’t ask her. She caught me off
guard. She was completely panicked.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: Strange… Wait a second! I think
that’s my husband. PASTOR : Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>pastor’s wife</strong>: Good evening. The schoolteacher has
been anxiously waiting for you. PASTOR : Yes?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Yes. I’d like to have a quick chat
with you.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Please. We’d better go to my study. It’s
quieter there.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Well, how can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I spoke to the midwife today: she
said she now knew who tortured her son. PASTOR : She does?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: She’ll only tell the police. That’s
why she went to town. PASTOR : Well?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: She left the boy behind alone and has
locked the whole house.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Locked it? SCHOOLTEACHER : I went to the
doctor’s next door to ask him what was going on, whether he was taking
care of the child or… But there’s a piece of paper saying that the
practice is closed until further notice. The doctor and his children
have disappeared. PASTOR : What do you mean? SCHOOLTEACHER : I don’t
know. I thought you might have been informed. That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Xenia… Wasn’t his daughter in school?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Yes, she was. She never mentioned
anything.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I asked Marie and Martin. They both
know nothing either. PASTOR : Why should they?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: I don’t know. When I went to the
midwife’s place, they were there with a few others in the garden. PASTOR
: To do what?!</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: They were looking for the boy. PASTOR
: Why?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: They wanted to help him.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: So what</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: Nothing. I had forgotten it. Today,
it came back to my mind again. PASTOR : I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>pause.</strong>: SCHOOLTEACHER: When they found the Baron’s
son… the last time he had been seen, he was with the children.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: What are you getting at?</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher</strong>: A couple of days before Hansi was
almost beaten to death, the steward’s daughter had predicted precisely
that to me. Supposedly, she had dreamed it. The police thinks she’s
lying. Who told her about it? Who announced it to her?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: If I understand you correctly, you’re saying
that your pupils, my children included, committed these crimes. Is that
right? Do you realize what you’re saying? Do you know…</p>
<p><strong>74. the midwife’s house ext/day</strong>: The steward, his
wife and the schoolteacher try to break into the house. First the
steward tries several keys. As this doesn’t work, they break down a door
at the rear of the house and go in.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The midwife never came back. I waited
until the morning, two days later. Then, I went to the manor house to
inform the Baron. He referred me to the steward and said to open the
house immediately and to look after the disabled boy.</p>
<p><strong>back to the scene.</strong>: 96</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I had never come to the midwife’s house
and felt uncomfortable at the idea of barging into somebody else’s house
without asking. It was strange, but we were still seeking and calling
out anxiously Hansi’s name, and I already knew, that we were searching
in vain. Anyone who knew the midwife also knew how devoted she was to
her disabled child, and that she would never have left her wounded Hansi
all alone.</p>
<p><strong>76. the midwife’s house ext/day</strong>: The schoolteacher,
the steward and his wife come out from behind the house, leave the
property and go their separate ways on the street. All that is left is
the empty house with its closed shutters.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: During the next few weeks, the village
gossip-factory worked overtime. Some claimed, the doctor was Hansi’s
father. He and the midwife had tried to abort the child so that the
shame of their relationship wouldn’t be found out, and that’s how the
child became disabled. Others even went as far as to claim that there
was something fishy about the death of the doctor’s wife, and that they
wouldn’t be surprised, if the two weren’t responsible for it.</p>
<p><strong>77. montage: ext/day</strong>: The houses of the doctor, the
pastor, the farmer, the street before the school, the estate’s
administrative buildings and the manor house. There is nobody to be
seen.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Whoever had lynched the boy obviously knew
about the hidden crimes of his parents.</p>
<p><strong>high angle shot:</strong>: The villagers are about to take
their seats. The smaller children are sitting with their parents on the
pews. All are in their Sunday best, the members of the militia are in
uniform. Flags are planted. Joyful excitement reigns everywhere. Once
the church is full, the Baron, the Baroness and their son Sigi walk down
the aisle and sit down in the front row.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On the Sunday between those dates, the
whole village came to the festive service. An atmosphere of expectation
and departure was in the air. From now on nothing would be the same.
Only a few days ago everybody would have called the life they lived as
God’s will, worthy of being lived, and would have shunned any change.
The strange joy with which the coming war was greeted, showed that this
certainty of order and security was based on very shaky foundations.</p>
<p><strong>close-ups:</strong>: Of all the adult leading characters of
the film, aside from the doctor and the midwife. Also of Eva and her
father.</p>
<p><strong>more close-ups.</strong>: The schoolteacher on the gallery
lifts his hands and cues them to begin. They start SINGING. We see them
one after the other. At the end we see Marie: she wears the white ribbon
in her hair.</p>
