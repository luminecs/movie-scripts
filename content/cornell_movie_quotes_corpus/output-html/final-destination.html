hour… and although we know it may be difficult, we must ask you some
questions… regarding today’s events, while it’s still fresh in your

any potential… criminal investigation.</p>

<p><strong>mr. waggner</strong>: Didn’t you… “see” it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. waggner</strong>: Couldn’t you “predict” it? Couldn’t you
read his mind?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Mr. Waggner…</p>
<p><strong>mr. waggner</strong>: You caused Tod so much guilt over He
took his own life.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He wouldn’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He… he told me we would be friends again after
you got better. After</p>
<p><strong>mr. waggner</strong>: All my wife and I will ever know is</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Almost Autumn.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s only the end of June.</p>

If you focus, even now, Almost like bein’ able… to see the</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Like, um… you’re mad about something?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: A piece of debris… from the plane.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You went there? I’ve wanted to go</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It is. But that didn’t stop me. Shouldn’t
stop you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why were you there last night?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Look, I’ve seen enough T.V. to know the
F.B.I. doesn’t investigate teen suicides. But they were there last
people got off the plane is probably suspicious. And it doesn’t help
that</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why were you there last night?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It’s you.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Not a likeness. It’s how you make</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m… really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Like you, the sculpture doesn’t even know
what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an
absolute but incomprehansible</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Before that day, you were just But at that
moment… on the plane…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I didn’t see what you saw, but I</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: And you can still feel it, can’t</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: That’s why I was there last night.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve never dealt with death before. I wasn’t
alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean,</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: “It?”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What if Tod… is just the first… of us?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Is that something you’re “feeling?”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t know. I wish I could just see him… one
more time, then, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Then, let’s go see him!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Gives me a rush…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: This place?!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Doin’ somethin’ I’m not supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Good call. Very “Quincy.”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That… him?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I think. But why’d they make him up like…
Michael Jackson?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s him, but… he’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>alex clear</strong>: Ahhh! fuck! You fucking Ohmygod!
OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD! asshole. You think this He’s not dead? is funny, you
fucking dick? Tod, if you’re not dead I’m gonna fucking kill you!</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: Please don’t yell…</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: You’ll wake the dead.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why..?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasm.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m… a friend of his. His best friend. See,
his father…</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: They said he hung himself, but</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: I crafted a reconstruction of the</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What are all those tiny marks?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: Cuticle lacerations.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why would he pull at the wire if he</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Why would they say it was a suicide… if it
weren’t?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: His father’s pretty fucked up with</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: In Death…</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: … there are no accidents. No
coincidencess. No mishaps. And no… escapes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You saying Tod did kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: Suicide. Murder. Plane crash.
What</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: You may not realize it, but we’re all
just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we leading to
the grave.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Design?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: If Life is like a box of only upset
the big hand holding the hospital you just see the big cage Game
over.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Maybe there’s no way to win…</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: You already did that by walking off
the plane. Now you gotta out when Play your hunch, Alex. If you think
you can get away from it. But beware the risk of cheating the And you
don’t even want to fuck with</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m sorry we broke in.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: No harm. No foul.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We didn’t find what we were looking for.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, we did.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bludworth</strong>: I’ll see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: The mortician was whacked.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: He was trippin’ on formaldehyde.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He said Death has a design. Even before he
said that I had been seeing patterns.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: As in flannels and plaids?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How many died on Flight 180? From our
group?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Thirty-nine.</p>

<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right. April 25th.</p>

know… “Oswald shot</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m not just layin’ down a bunch of math here,
with this. I’m talking about indications… omens… that day, that we were
meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of… would</p>

Tod’s death… and maybe our own… will happen because of… an active
Presence.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The mortician said Death has a But what if it

<p><strong>ken</strong>: She’s concerned about you. I’m concerned about
you.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Why don’t you want to talk to her… or me?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dad… you and mom have helped me out, so much.
But there’s… some things I need to understand before I can talk… to
anyone about it.</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: The National Transportation Safety Board
has a new theory tonight on the possible cause of Euro-Air Flight
180…</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: Deterioration of silicon insulation on

combustible fluids.</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: A spark in the fuel switch…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s Tod’s seat…</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: … may have ignited the fuel line. And
proceeded to the fuel pump.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The path of the explosion… That’s Death’s
design.</p>
<p><strong>ms. lewton</strong>: Some nights I’m woken up by the</p>
<p><strong>ms. lewton</strong>: Everything here reminds me… of memories,
you know… but now all I</p>
<p><strong>ms. lewton</strong>: Laura, I gotta call you back.</p>
<p><strong>ms. lewton</strong>: This is Valerie Lewton. I need Agent
Schreck…</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Checking the air in her tires to make sure
they’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Get in the car.</p>

<p><strong>ms. lewton</strong>: Oh… mom’s favorite.</p>
<p><strong>john denver</strong>: He was born in the summer of his
twenty-seventh year…</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Where’d you get this “pattern” from?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I didn’t ask for what happened to me on the
plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I’m a nut. I’m used to</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress.
I haven’t developed a narcissistic deity complex. I’m not This just is.
There’s a pattern in</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And I’m not sure yet how… but I intend to
break this one.</p>
<p><strong>john denver</strong>: He left yesterday behind him/ You might
say he’s born again…</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Alex, you got our attention, at first,
because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: I know you didn’t blow up that plane.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: I don’t believe you have magical</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Alex… can you promise me that</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No… I can’t. As long as I’m in</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Alright, go on. Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Kid gives me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: We got nothing to hold him.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: I don’t mean that… There’s a couple of
times, there… I almost believed him.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Sometimes, you give me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>john denver</strong>: When he first came to the
mountains,</p>

<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ms. Lewton!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, Alex…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I don’t know where he is. He’s not talking to
me.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Because I didn’t believe him.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: If he should contact you, it would be in
the best interest of your own safety to contact us.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Terry’s name should be on this wall.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: So, why’d you want us to meet you here?
Now?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: They’re watching me, see if I go to</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: They’ll follow my car. That’s why you’re
taking me.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Why would I want to see him?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Because he knows which one of us is next.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Um… okay… drive the speed limit, right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And don’t pass on the right.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Billy! I’m gettin’ a vision! You’re the next
one…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, man, why’d you say that?!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: ‘Cause if you say another word, I’m gonna
fuckn’ kill ya!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: He could be anywhere from here to a</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Are they up there?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Somehow… is 180 still in flight? Somewhere…
are they still safe?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: When I was a kid, like, six or Every night…
it seemed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Most kids do, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Most kids never have it happen.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: When I was ten… my dad went into a 7-11 for
cigerettes. I guess he heard somebody say “Don’t turn around.” So</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: And, let me tell ya, I had every If that was
the design for my</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: And so, anyway… I’ve thought of</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Where my dad is still safe. Where he this
second life, here. A place where our friends are still</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: But that place might only exist in</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: And that is the only way we can beat</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: This won’t be safe.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Those guys are probably fifteen</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No.. I mean, I don’t have anything</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Nothing is… anymore.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I can’t go home. After Lewton’s, they’ll be
after me.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We’re takin’ you to a cabin in the woods,
it’s only a couple miles from my house. Keep off the highways, they’ll
be</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Alright, Browning, you fuckin’</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why do you think I was hiding?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: They blame me for everything. Her,</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Your shoe prints were in the blood.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I already told you…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m not talkin’ about if you did it. Or if
you knew she was dead… Did you know she was going to be</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah. When she died… at that moment, I could
tell she saw something… horrible.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Out of us… who’s next to see it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Please tell me I’m gonna get to see the Jets
win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Me, right? That’s why you’re not</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool, that
time…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Whatta you whinin’ about? He said I’m
next.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: He didn’t say nothin’. Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You have a responsibility to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Is knowing going to make it easier?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You get off havin’ control over me. Let me
choose how to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It doesn’t matter who’s next… we’re all on the
same list.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Aww, fuck… really?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Then why bother? What’s the fuckin’ point?
Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any
longer?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Knock it off!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: May as well go out under my own free will,
right?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Not with us in the fuckin’ car!</p>
<p><strong>clear billy</strong>: Stop it! Hey, c’mon, man…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What’s your fuckin’ worry? If it’s wouldn’t

<p><strong>billy</strong>: And I fuckin’ HATED FRENCH CLASS!</p>
<p><strong>alex clear</strong>: Carter, stop it, you Get control of
yourself! fuckin’ maniac!!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s what I’m doin’!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I know what you’re doing! It’s</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT’S</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Watch it! Watch it!</p>
<p><strong>clear alex</strong>: Stop the car! Let us out!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I am… so close to puking, you don’t wanna
know.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We’re afraid, too, Carter, but we’re</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: So, stop what you’re doing and STOP THIS CAR!

<p><strong>carter</strong>: It broke!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No one’s that strong.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Bullshit. He saved your life…again!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Jesus fucking Christ!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You should have been next. After Lewton, you
should’ve been next.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You’re the fuckin’ devil.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But I saved him. I intervened. Just</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Police are coming.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s why It skipped Carter and went to the
next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors
will cheat the design.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: “Intervention?” What are you, God now?!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Of course not! Gods aren’t afraid to die! Gods
don’t die! We do!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: You’re losin’ it. The police will be here. We
have to go to the cabin. You can hide there. Get your head</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: After Billy… it’s me. And then you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, I won’t let it happen, okay.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Then, get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch. I overlooked it.
You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not
forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: She was up there a minute ago…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I’m not turning him in. There’s another life
that needs him now.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I go with you.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Don’t hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Tell us where he is. Wait at home,</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I… never moved. Christa asked me to move, but
I didn’t change seats. I would’ve moved up… next to Tod… How could I not
remember… that… I never moved. Clear’s seat was in front of mine…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: She’s next.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Lost him.</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: From the direction… there’s only</p>
<p><strong>the metal arm</strong>: of the garage door opener RIPS
through the windshield, locking upon the windshield wiper grille. The
other end remains attached to the garage roof interior, essentially
acting as an anchor.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re grounded in the car. Don’t touch
anything. DON’T MOVE.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Alex, get away from there!</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Any part of that line touches you, you’re
dead.</p>
<p><strong>weine</strong>: Get back! You’ll both die!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: No! No! Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: When I do this.. it’ll have skipped</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You know what to do. I’ll always be</p>
<p><strong>schreck</strong>: Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: A little more. Little more!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s here. A beautiful boy.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I felt him! When the baby was born… I felt
Alex pass through me… like the night he died…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: 13th of May… 4:25 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Exactly a year… to the minute.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We beat it, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Alex was right.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It did skip us.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I believe… that’s what Alex believed. But how
do we know… this wasn’t the design all along?</p>
