<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Somebody shut the goddam window. Let a man
think.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Possible straight gets a – – lovely little
four.</p>
<p><strong>first player</strong>: On the last hand even, you couldn’t
give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: I put the brakes on your straight, didn’t I?
There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: And our lucky friend from Chicago gets a
queen with his pair of sixes. Little lady make you happy, Buster?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Deal to yourself, clown.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Dealer gives himself a – I might have known.
Bet your sixes, Buster.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I told you not to call me that. Cost you –
Ninety-four bucks.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Biggest pot of the whole game, I got to
drop.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Interested?</p>
<p><strong>first player</strong>: Wouldn’t call you if I had a pair
higher’n sixes. Which I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Don’t seem like he’d bet out without something
better than the sixes, does it? Cost me every cent I’ve won since
yesterday afternoon. But I tell you, I got this stubborn streak. Call
the ninety-four dollars.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You can’t have better than a pair of
kings!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh, I’m not claiming anything that fine. Just
enough to beat the pair of sixes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You seen my hole card, you bastard! He was
dealing them high.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You stole that dough.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You better watch those loose lips of yours, you
want to have any teeth left behind them – Buster.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You wouldn’t of shelled out ninety- four
bucks –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I called you on account of I didn’t think you
had another pair or another six and I know a punk like you would get
greedy and try and buy the last hand.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>hackie</strong>: What you looking for, mister?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Do I have to be looking for something?</p>
<p><strong>hackie</strong>: I can pretty much tell.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: You can pretty much tell what?</p>
<p><strong>hackie</strong>: Some guys come to town, I can tell if
they’re looking for something.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: What do you think I’m looking for?</p>
<p><strong>hackie</strong>: If you’re looking for girls, I can fix you
up.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I strongly doubt if you could fix me up. In
that department.</p>
<p><strong>hackie</strong>: Well what are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: You’re looking for a clout in the head if
you don’t keep your face to the road.</p>
<p><strong>second hackie</strong>: Hey, you know who that is?</p>
<p><strong>hackie</strong>: No. Who?</p>
<p><strong>second hackie</strong>: Shorty? Want to hear who just checked
into the Park Sherman… Yes, you do. Lancey Hodges.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: The Kid know?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Somebody sure as hell ought to tell The
Kid. Lancey Hodges is in town.</p>
<p><strong>first drinking man</strong>: Kid’s been laying for him a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: You ask me, The Kid’ll go after him as soon
as he hears.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Who’s got a better right?</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: You going to tell The Kid, Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Hell, I can’t not tell him.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: It’s where he’s been headed for years.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: What you say, Kid?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey, Hoban.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Where you been? Boys been holding a chair
for you in back.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Business opportunity come along. Something too
good to pass up.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Turn a profit?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had it took
back.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Oh, one of those.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You been in too many rough ones lately,
Kid. You can’t go on forever, coming out in one piece.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I got to build my stake, Aren’t enough chances
in this town to let one go.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: You’re too good, that’s your trouble. People
who know you’re the Cincinnati Kid, they don’t want to sit down with you
–</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: For nickels and dimes… Thing is I’ve about used
up St. Louis.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: The streets are getting full of guys you’ve
hustled.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Been thinking about Miami. There’s nothing to
keep me here.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: The hell there isn’t Lancey Hodges’ in
town.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah? The Man himself, here in St. Louis – I
might just stick around Shooter.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Mr. Schlaegel? How are you? And your
enchanting wife?… Tomorrow is quite convenient… I generally prefer stud
but you name it… Your stakes are my pleasure, sir… Thank you, why don’t
we make it after lunch? My diet these days is enough to spoil anyone
else’s appetite… A pleasure, sir. Please remember me to your charming
wife.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I been seeing it coming for a long time,
Kid. Long time.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I ain’t exactly been hiding it.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: No, you ain’t been hiding it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well I got to know.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Sure, you got to know. We all got to
know.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sometime or other we got to find out how much
juice we got.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: That’s why I had to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You ever sit down with him?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Nothing. Nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You lost.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I didn’t lose. I’m too good to lose when I
set my mind to it. I play poker a certain way, Kid. I’ve had my Lancey
Hodges. Only with me it was Whistling Sam Magee to New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I heard about him.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Well then you know it all… about 20 years
ago it was, maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Why, I lost it. It dried me up on the
inside for a long, a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I been where I’m going, know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You think I’m ready?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: several seconds of</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: But you’re not going to take my word for
it, are you? Are you now?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No, I ain’t. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I know, I know. You got to find out for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t figure to take him right away. But if I
can hang in there long enough, I can outlast him. If I can outlast him,
I got a chance. You admit that, don’t you, that I got a chance?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I already said I didn’t think you were
ready.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Did you think you were ready when you sat down
with Whistling Sam Magee?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Kid, I thought I was the best stud poker
player in the world. I’m telling you now, I thought I was the best.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well, I don’t think I’m just a cocky square
with a fair hand with cards. I got something.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: No, you ain’t no cocky square. And you
probably got something.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Okay. And I ain’t saying that you was either
when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: If you got the stuff, being a little cocky
don’t hurt you none.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well, would you say if I got any chance at
all?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: This much of a chance. If Lancey is not
right. If he’s got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or
something like that.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: But then everybody’d see he wasn’t right and it
wouldn’t prove nothing. Listen, we got to have it understood. If he’s
not right, we call it off till he is.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You’re set on a real showdown, aren’t you?
Your mind’s all made up.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I got to. You said yourself I got to. I’m
overdue.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Yeah, you been around a long time – I was a
lot younger than you when I went up against Whistling Sam – But you’d be
kinda young too, to be The Man.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I gotta find out.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Want me to set it up?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I wish you would, Shooter Man.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey, what if he turns me down?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He won’t, the way I’ll spread the word.
He’ll have to take you on, someone in your class. If he ducked it,
that’d make you The Man.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You think he knows I’m around?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He can smell meat like you a mile and a
half up the river. He knows you’re around and he’ll sit down with you.
You want to butt heads with The Man, I’ll set it up.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: There’s your woman.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I wouldn’t want to wait around too long. I want
to get in and get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He must of come to St. Louis for a big
money game. I’ll probably get asked do I want to deal it for them. And
however long that takes, he’ll have to rest up for you.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh, well, if he’s tooling a dollar, I can
understand that. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You got much of a stake?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Close to three grand.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Work on it. But three grand will give you a
ride and even if you don’t win, why you’ll come away with a good idea of
what you’re made of. But once you go in Kid you can’t quit. You get that
straight right now. Two of you go in and only one of you can come
out.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well, school’s out. I damn sure don’t want no
lessons. I want everything he’s got.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: It’s the only way to be, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: When we leaving town, Kid? This week?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No, I won’t be ready. Not for a while.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I thought –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Might even turn out we don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You must feel different about it than you
did Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah, I’m feeling a little different.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It’s all right. You don’t have to act like a
cat. You’re not bothering me.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You want me to turn out the light?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No. I’m overtired, that’s why I can’t sleep.
Why can’t you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Undertired, I guess. If a person rests
all day, she doesn’t have much to rest up from at night. Why don’t you
have a nice hot bath? I could give you a rubdown and then you could have
a nice hot bath, and then maybe you could sleep.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: ’Kay. Can’t hurt to try it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What did you do with yourself this time?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Last night I went to a movie with The
Shooter’s woman. French movie.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: In French?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: They had the words in English at the
bottom of the picture. But The Shooter’s woman knew what they were
saying without it. Pig’s woman or somebody told me she went to
college.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sure. Majored in man-eating.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I think maybe she really did go. But I
never quite dared to up and ask her.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I didn’t know you ran with The Shooter’s
woman.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: We got to be kind of friendly when you
both were in that three-day game down to Cairo. ’Course she’s older’n
me.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: And been around more. A lot more. What was the
movie like?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Weird. It wasn’t a straight story where
you knew whose side you were on, the way you do in regular pictures.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: American pictures.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Yeah. There were lots of things I didn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What was it about?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Well, there’s this town in Europe a long
time ago where they get a message from a Spanish general he’s coming to
spend the night with his troops. So all the men are scared silly about
what the soldiers will do to them.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Nothing weird about that.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: But all the wives and daughters tell the
men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That don’t make much sense.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Wait. The way they handle it is they go
to bed with the Spaniards. And the next morning the soldiers go off
peacefully and everybody’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Including the husbands and fathers? Don’t they
suspect?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: That’s part of what I wasn’t sure of. I
guess they know what went on but they care more about their safety and
their money than they do about their honor.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Then they got their heads screwed on straight.
Honor’s just an idea. You can’t see or feel it and you can’t eat it and
you sure as hell can’t get any mileage on it.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I’ll just turn off the bath water.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Hello… Yes, it is. You want him? Shooter!
Telephone! Shooter!</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Phone for you. I always seem to be the one to
answer it, no matter who it’s for.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: If you’d rather we put it in my room –</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Hello?… Well, hello. What brings you to our
fair city? Little action, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: How could you guess, Shooter? I was invited
by a Mr. William Schlaegel –</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Owns most of the Schlaegel Brewery.
Braumeister beer.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: As he put it, rather bluntly, I felt, we
don’t want everyone to have to watch everyone else dealing to see to it
they don’t make any little accidental errors by mistake. I told him a
man couldn’t ask for a better guarantee of a fair-and-square game than
having The Shooter deal it. So if you’re willing, we’re meeting at two
o’clock in the afternoon. Ask for Mr. Schlaegel’s suite at the Park
Sherman… Good. I’m glad you can do it, Shooter. Be a pleasure to see you
again… Oh pretty much the same… Just have to be a little careful about
smoking and drinking and eating – and breathing. See you tomorrow. Good
night.</p>
<p><strong>christian’s voice</strong>: Would you wear it in public?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Wouldn’t be much point wearing it in private.
Sure, why not, as long as you don’t have a bulge to hide?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I don’t know, Melba.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: My guess is there isn’t anything about you
needs hiding. But I’ll give you a more definitive opinion at the
bath.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: At the what?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Turkish Bath. After we’re through shopping.
I’m treating you, Christian.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I never been. I’m not even sure what you
do.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: You don’t do anything. That’s what’s so
marvelous. They do it to you.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: The third time I stayed. Never went back
to the boarding house except to pick up my things.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: And that side of it’s held up? No complaints
in the bed department?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Well, just one.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: The nights he isn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: He really does that to you, does he? You got
one of the rare ones.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You find a guy, you love him, and that’s
it. It’s supposed to just go on like that for life. Right?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: According to the propaganda, right.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: But it isn’t my life, it’s his life, with
me tacked on. You have any idea what it’s like to be a hash slinger in a
cheap restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: No, honey, the stock crash wafted me right
from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: It’s hell, if you’ll excuse the word. But
I didn’t want to quit. The Kid made me. I felt I ought to hang on to
something that was me away from him. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Sure. Some girls solve the problem by taking
on an extra guy.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I’m serious. Having children might take
care of it, I don’t know. Or – this is really a terrible thing to
admit.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Your most sordid secrets are safe with me.
Confess.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: If he was rich, or famous –</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Why don’t you give him both?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Why not? Well, if he was rich and famous,
maybe I wouldn’t mind so much just being – just a woman to him. Do you
think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Somehow! Are you sincere, sweetie? Oooo –
divine. Isn’t this heaven?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I’m not sure. In a way it seems soft of
–</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Decadent? Depraved?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Wicked?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Well, yes.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: That’s what I meant by heaven.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Still queens – possible flush – no help –
possible flush.</p>
<p><strong>first wealthy type</strong>: Queens check to the
possibles.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>second wealthy type</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>first wealthy type</strong>: Fold.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: And up two.</p>
<p><strong>second wealthy type</strong>: Fold.</p>
<p><strong>third wealthy type</strong>: Biggest pot yet.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Call the two thou.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Queen high.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Jack high. Can you beat that?</p>
<p><strong>first wealthy type</strong>: He just did.</p>
<p><strong>third wealthy type</strong>: It’s your office.</p>
<p><strong>second wealthy type</strong>: Dallas or Tulsa?</p>
<p><strong>third wealthy type</strong>: She just said office.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How the bloody hell did you figure out I
didn’t have the king or the ace?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I recollect a young fellow putting the same
question to Eddie the Dude. It was a game in the grand lounge of the
“J.M. White, Third,” the largest paddle-wheeler ever built. “Son,” Eddie
told him, “All you paid was the looking price. Lessons are extra.” First
time I heard of this Cincinnati Kid was in New Orleans, at Yeller’s. I
knew right away I’d have to play him someday.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You’ll enjoy his game.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I may admire it. But if he’s all that good,
I doubt if I’ll enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: The tougher the competition, the better you
used to like it.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I’ve learned to take everything in
moderation.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Have a drink with us?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Better not. Shooter said they’d break at
seven, and he has to have his food first, then his nap. You know,
there’s a day in your life I’m looking forward to.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: In my life?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: The day The Kid becomes The Man.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: How’d you sleep Kid?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I slept okay.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I hope you don’t mind my not being there
when you woke up.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No I don’t mind – What she was talking about,
Shooter’s woman – I’m going up against a big game soon.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: She told me. It’s a very big game, I
hear.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Will it be long?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Why? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I thought –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thought what?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I’d go home and see Mama.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I wouldn’t be able to spare you much
change.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t want much. Bus is really
the best way to go.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Would a hundred fish do it? For the bus and
something nice to bring your Mama?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: That would be fine, Kid. Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: When would you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: There’s no reason for not going right now
unless –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Unless what?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Unless you wanted to go to bed first.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Do you want to? Would you like it?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Un-huh. I’d like it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You want dessert?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: No. You?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I don’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You still haven’t said it.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Said what?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: If you’re coming back.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Maybe I ought to stay with Mama and Papa
a while, and see.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What’s to see?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I never did like city streets.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Uh-huh. The promise didn’t fulfill itself
for me.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Come to the city and all. Electric lights
and flush toilets. All the pretty dreams – it was all promise.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I don’t know if you do or not Kid –
You’re city – and I’m country – You grew up with it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t think that’s why you’re going – because
you like it so much better in the country.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: What will you do?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well, I’ve got that big game.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I heard he’s The Man for you.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yes. If I won, there would be a lot of
money.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You’ll win. You been coming on strong a
long way. This is your time. Come home with me to Mama’s Kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I know you are honey – I know it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’ll go down to the bus with you.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’ll go down with you.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Kid –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: This is going to sound kind of funny to
you, but I want to ask it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Do you think there’s any chance, if you
do win this big game, that you might do something else besides cards? I
don’t mean never play poker. I just mean not have it be the only thing
you do.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hell, it’s the only thing I know how to do.
What else is there for a guy never finished school? College graduates
are walking the streets looking for jobs – trained people, engineers,
scientists!</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I realize –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: When you’re The Man, you don’t have to hustle –
When you’re The Man, The Best, the Big Money comes around on their knees
just beggin’ to hustle you. I’m not goin’ to quit. I’m goin’ to win.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Yes, I can see that. Of course I didn’t
say quit.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well you see how it is.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Christian, you aren’t doing this to be off my
back, in case I lose?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I been thinking about it a long time. I
been planning to go home and see how I felt about things.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: And this just helped you decide.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Then don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: No, this is your time – Now you go on
Honey and you play The Man – I’ll be at Mama’s.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I wish it could be more.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I don’t guess I’ll ever forget these
rooms, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t guess I will either.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You going to move?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: If I win, it won’t be good enough. If I lose, I
lose it all.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Goodbye, Kid. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Goodbye, Christian.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Four stacks? Right, Schooter?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thank you for the entertainment, gentlemen. My
particular gratitude to you, Lancey. It’s been a rare pleasure to watch
a great artist at work. Thank you for the privilege.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Well now, son, you’re quite welcome. Can’t
say I recall another man, in all my days on the three rivers, who seemed
to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good day, gentlemen. You’re welcome to use the
premises as long as you like.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Hi, Kid. Shooter here. Listen, I told the
woman I’d take her to the ball park, but I’m still working. How about
you and Christian take her out?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Christian’s gone home to see her folks.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Oh. Well listen, would you mind taking her
yourself? The gang’ll be there, in the section… Thanks. Appreciate it.
See you.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: You owe me two fish on the out, plus three on
the inning, minus two on no strikeouts so far.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Hiya, Kid. Getting yourself in shape for The
Man? Shooter still on the job?</p>
<p><strong>hoban’s woman</strong>: Where’s Christian?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Lay off that.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: What’d she do, take off? So did mine. Don’t
lose no sweat, Kid, there’s plenty more where they came from. All shapes
and sizes.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hi, Hoban. Sokal. Pig.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Boyer. One to two on the sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Five to three, I’ll give you. Two- fifty
against one-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Mark it.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: I figure they’ll walk him. Fill up first.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Not with who’s coming up. I’ll take the same
odds.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Get some of this sun.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Mark it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Guess I will.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Bunting, Sokal.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: So they pitched to him. I still win.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: Everybody been on the phone to everybody about
coming to watch you and Lancey. Big Spriigi, Yeller to N’Orleans, Old
Lady Fingers. They’re all coming.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Let me give you some of this. Keep you from
burning.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t think –</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Can’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Chance to invest your profits. Bet you an
even fin he make first.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Who we got – Warwick? You got yourself a bet,
pal.</p>
<p><strong>sokal’s voice</strong>: Not your day, Hoban. Hey, beer!</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Mais tu es charmant –</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Charmant. Come here, please.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Any special reason?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Me. I’m special.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sure you are. You’re The Shooter’s woman.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Right. And maybe I’ll go on being The
Shooter’s Woman, even after you and I have had our little romp. What do
you think about that?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: First place, Old Shooter’ll come barging
through that door any minute. He said they were winding it up.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: No barging. He doesn’t have his key with him.
Have to buzz from downstairs. So we can treat ourselves to a little
sample of things to come.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Also it don’t mean anything to you, you’re
Christian’s friend?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Honey, she lost her franchise the minute she
got on that bus. You know that. I have a shaky sense of security, Kid.
Don’t make me feel unwanted.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: No good?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You know damn well how good it was. Where’s a
pack of cards?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: What do we need cards for?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Gin or casino, you name it. All I know is we’re
switching to another indoor sport.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Lady Fingers’ll want to come, I bet, and
she’s right on the edge of her stake. She could spell me dealing.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Sure, sure. Haven’t seen the dear old bitch
in fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Well, that’s it, then. Monday night, Room
Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel. And may the best man win.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Yes, that’s how it usually comes out in the
long run. You think this boy is going to give me trouble, Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Yeah, he’s going to give you trouble.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I don’t want it to be one of those marathon
games. Not any more.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Like the session with The Portugee at
Jolly’s in Omaha. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Sure, sure. Longest game I ever played
though, I was a kid on my way to the Klondike gold rush. At Soapy
Smith’s in Skagway. Four nights and three days.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You win?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Depends how you look at it. When we wound
up, the Yukon River had frozen over and you couldn’t get through to
Dawson City till the following June. Made myself a Hundred and fifty
bucks and missed the gold rush.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You been around a long time.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: That is undeniably true. But it doesn’t mean
I’m ready to retire. How old is this boy of yours?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something like
that.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Well, now, makes me feel a whole lot better,
knowing that. I was thirty- six when I sliced up Eddie the Dude. This
Kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but
Mr. Schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I ought to call my woman.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Yes, of course. They always like to know it
if you’re going to be late for supper.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Still building eights.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thanks for putting it together for me.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: It’s not my game.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Want to know what is?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Hello – Oh, hi, sugar – why not?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: What’s the switch?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Whose idea was that?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: He’s not coming home now.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Whatever you say, Shooter man.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Explain to The Kid, will you?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: He’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Tell him they decided to play a little
longer, and I’ll call him at his place later when the game’s over…
Right. Goodbye, honey.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Listen, Melba –</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I have to tell you first. You’re sitting down
with Lancey next Monday night.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I wish it was sooner. I wish it was
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Shooter’ll give you all the details
later.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t like waiting that long.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Let’s not kick a gift horse in the teeth,
sugar. We’ve got this time together. Let’s try to “fill each unforgiving
minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run.”</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Listen, what I was going to say before, I don’t
want you to think I’m being some kind of jerk or I don’t feel you’d be
great to sack up with.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Then let’s cut the filibuster.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’ve made dolls that were friends of mine’s
wives. I figured if they were willing, they were doing it to their
husbands, I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Of course. Any other attitude, you’re
degrading the woman. You’re not treating her as a person with a mind of
her own, but as somebody’s property.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Only thing is, it’s different with The Shooter
than anybody else. He’s so straight, I got the obligation to be
straighter with him than other people. So do you. On account of we both
owe him plenty.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I thought we just agreed that what you and I
did was strictly between us.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Can’t be. Shooter’s the closest thing to family
I got. It’s almost like he was my old man. Don’t you see how that’s got
a bearing on us?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Sure, it means I’m your mother.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shooter – very generous of you to come on such
short notice. Rosanna you know, and I think you’ve met my daughter June.
No point introducing you to William the Fourth. He has a bad memory for
names.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Mrs. Schlaegel. How are you, June. What’s
it all about, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Little something I’d like to sound you out on.
But the least I can do is offer you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Like me to fix it, love?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wonderful. Why don’t you do a batch of your
Bloody Marys? If that’s okay with you, Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Great. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Just don’t let it get wet again.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ve been quite busy on the telephone since I
last saw you. There’s a lot of interest all over the country in this
game with Lancey and The Kid.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Betting interest?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Jack Doyle in New York is giving twelve to
five on Lancey. Same odds in Reno. I’ve taken fifty thousand of it so
far.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Fifty thousand!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll probably go for more but I didn’t want to
rock the odds.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I knew you liked The Kid’s style but why
you going in so deep?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Two reasons. First, I want to see that smug
old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me. Second, as long as that’s
going to happen, I don’t see why I shouldn’t make some money out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: But how can you be so sure? The Kid could
do it, we both know that, but –</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: “Could” isn’t good enough for a man who hates
to lose money as much as I do. He’s going to need help – from the best
man with a pack of cards between Omaha and New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Not a chance, Bill. You ought to know I
never ever use what I got with the cards for nothing but tricks and
dressing up a game.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure, I know it. That’s why you’re the man
they choose to give them a square deal. That’s what makes it so perfect.
Nobody’ll be looking for it.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: It’s out. Out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The great thing is they’ll be so close, The
Kid won’t need much. Three or four key hands.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Understand this, Bill. I’d like for The Kid
to win, and I sure as hell don’t want to see you lose all that money
–</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If I did, I’d have to collect that twelve
grand you owe me. Not myself. My collection agents. You knew poor
Wildwood Jones, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: OK but I’m paying it off! It’s comin’ in
ain’t it? Six grand already. Bill, you got to listen to me –!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, I don’t. It’s quite the other way around.
You have some delusion you’re a free agent, but you’re not. I own
you.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: For God’s sake –!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shut up. I’ll cross the twelve off the books
and give you ten thousand dollars in cash. And you can tell The Kid if
he needs more of a stake, I’ll put it up. Marvelous. Here’s Rosanna with
what you need.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: – for that dry feeling on the roof of your
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Shine them up for you sir?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Fetch you a newspaper maybe?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: How about a singy-song then? I play good.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Play what?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Dry corn in this one. Blue shale stone from the
river in this one. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yes, I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hell, I’m ready for anything.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thank you very much. That was nice. Where did
you learn to do that?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I picked it up from Herman.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Who is Herman?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: My friend I pick it up from.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Is he a good friend?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I don’t know ‘bout that suh. He just a frien’
who teach me some things.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well, I don’t want a shine, but here’s fifteen
cents.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: And here’s another dime for you,
fella.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Nice little colored kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: – Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jansen</strong>: Monday night, uh, Kid?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Monday night.</p>
<p><strong>jansen</strong>: I sprung for some of the action. A yard and
a half of that five-to-two.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thanks, Jansen. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jansen</strong>: We got to get you loosened up. I never felt
you this tight.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Just tell The Shooter I’ll be there on the dot
Monday night.</p>
<p><strong>melba’s voice</strong>: And until then?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He doesn’t have to know.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I’m not asking for him.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Hello, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Can I help you with those?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Taking if off is harder than taking it on
in.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: How’s The Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You haven’t played yet?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Monday.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: This is Eric, Mama. He’s come to see
me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. craigie</strong>: How do, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: We lost suction on the pump right in the
middle of canning.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. craigie</strong>: There’s coffee. And sour ham and bread
in the warmer, if you’re hungry Eric.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. craigie</strong>: You know anything about canning, you
know we can’t stop now. If we’d been looking for company, we never would
have started.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Spring beans, you have to cook them fast.
But you find yourself some breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m all right. Bus stopped for doughnuts and
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You can stay with us tonight and still
make it back to St. Lou on the Sunday schedule by about midnight. I told
Mama and Papa about The Man. And all.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Where is Mr. Craigie?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. craigie</strong>: To the barn. Why don’t you go down and
introduce yourself? Christian and me’ll be at this another hour or
two.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I think I will. I think I’d like that.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Sure. And I’ll see you a little later on.
Papa don’t know everything. About you and me.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Craigie. I’m Eric
Stoner.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Christian’s Eric.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: You seen her?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: She’s helping her mother can.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: You minding to marry Christian?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You got any objections if I do, or if I
don’t?</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Son, that’s what I call a sharp answer.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It was what I call a sharp question.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: We don’t know much about you, Christian’s
mother and me.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m what’s known as a three-river man. Which
just means I go around playing stud poker wherever I can find the kind
of action I’m looking for.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: You met Christian when she was working to
Hot Springs?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah. I was playing in this game in the hotel
and she was a waitress in the coffee shop. We went out. I told her I
thought she could get a better job in St. Louis.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Now how did you happen to tell her that?
Maybe you run some kind of employment service on the side?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I said it because I wanted her in St. Louis.
Anyway, she made it there and she called me and we been seeing each
other ever since.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Living together?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah, living together.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: How come she come home now? She going to
have a baby?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: You two have a fight?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: She must have had a reason.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Think so? Well, you’ve known her longer than
me. Look, Mr. Craigie, let me and Christian find out a few things then
maybe I won’t have to answer your questions.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: I never run across anybody like you. I
guess I don’t understand gamblers.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That’s all right. I don’t understand
farmers.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: You say things that sound smart alecky. But
I’m not sure if they really are smart alecky.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well I can’t take into account what somebody’s
going to feel every time I say something.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Are you a believer?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: In some things.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: I mean in God.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That’s a tough one. I don’t disbelieve in Him,
but I couldn’t say I believed in Him either. I guess I just never paid
Him much mind. Didn’t seem important.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: God not important?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t mean what He does isn’t important – if
He exists. I mean it’s not important to me whether He exists or not.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Christian was raised in a Christian
home.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Is that so? I didn’t know — I’m not aware of
the difference. I’m not asking permission to marry Christian, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: If I was, the only person I’d be asking it from
is her.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Who is this fella Christian says you’re
going to play that’s so important?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He’s the king of the stud poker players.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: And you’re going to play him.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Are you any good?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m this good. The Man has got to play me.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: What happens if he don’t?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Then I’m The Man.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: That important to you?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I been trying to figure that out ever since I
set it up.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: You playing because of money?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Christian said you never was much worried
about money – I been worried about money most of my life – up until I
figured out it wasn’t so important.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No, it’s necessary, but it isn’t so
important.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Well how come you want to play this King
fella?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Ambition – maybe security, like that.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Is it aspiration to be the King or just
uncertainty about the future?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I ain’t looking for security if that’s what you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Not trying to lock something up tight and
nail it down?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That would figure into it. But that isn’t all
of it. – It’s important to me.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Now son which is more important to you,
this king business or Christian?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: If you got the guts to ask that question,
Mr. Craigie, I guess I got the guts to answer it. Christian, if you came
right down to it, is not as important as doing what I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Well son, I had to know.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: There never was a man worth a damn, to my
mind, who let his woman stand in the way of the thing he had to do. I
got to go now – see what I can do for a sick heifer. Why don’t you take
Christian, when her Mama lets go of her, and tell her I said you should
go to the old spring. It’s a good place.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thanks. I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: It stays warm all winter.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Papa’s mama used to bring her wash up
here.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: We liable to draw an audience?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Don’t worry. It’s on our land – Nobody
uses it.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: You must have said something to Papa gave
him the picture on us in St. Lou. Else he never would have spoke to you
about this place.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I told him on account of he already knew. Never
any sense feeding a man a lie he’s not going to believe.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Even if he did know, I’m glad you told
him.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey, you’re all wet!</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: So are you, foolish.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Let me get this straight in my head. Cards
is all a matter of luck, who gets dealt the best ones.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: So when one of you professional gamblers
sits down with a bunch of your – what do you call them – customers,
clients?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: The technical term is “suckers.” Or
“marks.”</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Their chance of winning is just as good as
yours, except if you got a way to control it, who gets what cards.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Not right. That’s cheating and it’s not any
part of what we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Then how do you win?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You see one of these cards is white on both
sides, one is red on both sides, and the other is white on one side, red
on the other.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: This. I put the three cards in a hat and shake
them up, and then I ask you to draw one card out blind. Put it face down
on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Okay, red on top. That eliminates the all-white
card, right. So the card you’ve picked is one of two – the all-red or
the red-and-white. One out of two is an even chance, an even-money
proposition. Right – you follow me?</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: So if I said I’ll bet you a dollar to
seventy-five cents the other side of that card is red, you’d take the
bet wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Seems like. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: And that answer makes you a sucker. Because the
odds are two to one, the other side of that card is red, and I ought to
be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy- five.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: But if there are just the two
possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: There are three possibilities. That can be the
red side of the red- and-white card, or it can be either side of the
all-red card. In two cases out of three the other side is red. And I’d
win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: You would?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sure. It’s obvious when I explain it, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Reckon so. Except if there’s only two
things that the bottom side can be, red or white –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Take my word for it – the odds are two to one.
And knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your
sucker. Not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds
are. In a poker game there can be a million different situations, each
with a different set of odds to figure. The man who ends up winners is
the man who knows when to bet and how much…</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: The sucker is still took advantage of,
isn’t he? The gambler knows something he don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sure – like if you grow better corn or raise a
cow that gives more milk than the other guy’s. Or two business men are
in competition, or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom.
Whatever your line is, the one who wins out is the one who knows his job
better.</p>
<p><strong>craigie</strong>: Seems like there should be something else
to it –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: There is – Making the man you’re playing
against think he’s got the best hand – and making him pay to find
out.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I can’t stay long. Papa’ll be getting up
to milk.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m the one can’t stay. I got to head for that
bus.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Why did you come, Kid?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well, hell, I don’t know. I had kind of a rough
time after you left.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Rough how?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Tuesday there was a ball game, but then the
Cardinals went on the road. I never known time to drag so; I was all
torn apart –</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Because of the poker game coming up?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That’s how I read it, but I was reading it
wrong. It wasn’t Lancey or the game that was chewing at my insides –</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: What else is there could give you such a
bad time?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I finally figured it. I located where the
trouble was. It was you.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Oh, –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: When you talk about doing something besides
poker if I get to be The Man, you don’t mean pass up the chance to make
some dough from it for a while?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I sure don’t. I told Papa, wherever money
comes from, it feels the same when you spend it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You were going to do some thinking down
here.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I done some.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’ll be back after the game Christian – You
wait here for me and I’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: All right Eric – Good luck Monday.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I got that made now. You said it right. My
time’s come.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Twenty-five years I been building a
reputation.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Handle this thing right and your reputation
will be better than ever.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I made up my mind to this. I ain’t going to
give him any help till he needs it.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I’m glad you’re taking a stand.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Hey, what if he starts off lucky and stays
ahead of the game the whole way. It could happen, you know.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: You’ll make it happen, Baby. I’ve got faith
in you –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Once more around the square.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: It’s a friendly town, St. Louis. I’ve always
said that.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: We ain’t seen much of you though, last
seven, eight years.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Climate, Shooter. In my declining years, I
spend more and more time in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Lot of folks been figuring another
reason you was keeping clear of the three rivers.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: What reason is that, Lady Fingers?</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Cincinnati Kid. That the way it is,
Lancey? You been scared of The Kid?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Should I be scared of him?</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Damn right you should! I’m telling
you, that boy going to make your stomach ulcer bleed before the night is
out. He’s close to murder. I seen him give a fella the shakes so bad on
a fourth card, it took a pint of corn liquor to settle him down.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Thanks for the warning.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Mow the man down, sugar pie, make it quick
and bloody. Been too many lean years for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I intend to take Shooter right along with
Lancey.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I’m not talking about the old Shooter. He’s
been factory rebuilt. A new spirit dwelleth in him, and his gaze is on
distant hills.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: So you showed up after all. You’re a
braver boy than I thought, so much the worse for you.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You think I’ll be sorry I come?</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Bound to. That Lancey ain’t human,
he’s one of them barracuda fish. He’s liable to bleed to death, right on
a flush hand before he give up to you. I seen him gut a fella so bad,
the fella quit and got up and spit red in the john and went square.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Hello, Kid. Pleasure to know you.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Lancey. I been looking forward a long time.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Sure, sure. You seem to know about
everybody. Yeller from New Orleans?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What do you say, Yeller? Still feeling salty
with me?</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Forgiven long since. We had a little
jurisdictional dispute.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I hustled a couple of boys, right in his
territory.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: So I tried to tell him our rules down there.
Colored marks are for colored hustlers.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: And I tried to tell him how I got no prejudice.
When I’m on the edge of my stake, I hustle anybody at all, regardless of
race, creed or color. Anybody at all.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Including my girl.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hell, I figured I was doin’ you a favor.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Did you know Old Cottonhead died?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: No, I hadn’t heard.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Heart give out in a high-low game.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: How you feel, Kid?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Great. You?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: The best. You think maybe we ought to see if
we can stir up some action?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Whatever you say, Lancey. You’re the – You’re
our guest in this town.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Well, I’m kind of in the mood to play a
little cards.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I think we ought to be able to get a game
together in this crowd.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: But first you take a look at things – make
sure everything’s the way you want it. I already been around.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thanks. I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: It’s an old table. Everything’s pretty old
in this hotel.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It’s solid, that’s what counts. And you got the
top fixed perfect.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Light all right for you?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Two hundred watt bulb.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Fine, excellent. Okay with you?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Sure, sure. Shooter’s set us up just
great.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sure has.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Thank you, gents. Tried to do the best I
could. Cards?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Good a time as any.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Hoban! Okay! You both know Joe Hoban. He’s
a draw poker man, but clean and straight as they come.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: They come from the St. Louis Bridge Club, but
they’re poker size cards. They been bonded by the club steward and I
seen him take them out of the safe. Shooter, Lady Fingers and me pick
them up and come straight here with them.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Hoban’s selling them to us at five dollars
a pack, with the usual guarantee. If it’s proved any deck is spooked, he
pays off the losers.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: St. Louis Bridge Club, eh? Steward still
that old yard bird Okra?</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Old stud man, Okra.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Quite a character. Quite a character.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Nobody heard from me what the cards were for,
Kid.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Been ten years since I seen or spoke to Old
Okra.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: ’Kay, fine. Don’t worry about it, Lancey. Who’s
sitting down with us, Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Four of us. Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc Sokal.
If that’s all right with you both?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: ’Kay, fine.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Sure, sure. Shall we have a look at the
decks?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Well, Kid, what’s your game?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t mind stud poker if that’s okay with
you.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I got no objections to stud. Gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Tell The Kid I have a suite on the fifth
floor. He can drop up during the breaks. Bedroom all for him any time he
wants a nap.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: That’s thoughtful of you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m a thoughtful man. I hope you are.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Privilege of age. Can’t take the glare of
the morning sun in my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You want to have the usual brandy and
coffee on hand, Kid? Anything special for you, Lancey?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Why, yes, Shooter. Creme de menthe frappe.
Green.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You got that, Hoban? Gentlemen, if there
are no objections, I’m the dealer. These rooms have been contracted for,
and there will be an ante of ten dollars per chair, per day. During the
breaks for me, Old Lady Fingers has agreed to deal, but she don’t care
to be a player –</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers’ voice</strong>: Do too care!</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Can’t afford to play, that’s the real
truth. Had a bad year and I’m way over my edge.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Lady Fingers will get three dollars an hour
from the ante, plus her room and food, and a five-minute break every
hour. Gents?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Fine, Shooter man.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: ’Kay with us.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: If you don’t see me when you need me,
call room three-oh-eight. You know who else ain’t with us no more?
Miriam, widow used to run the kitchen game to South Chi. Lost two
month’s Relief at blackjack, coal dealer cut her credit, and she froze
in her bed.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Gentlemen, this is a game of five- card
stud poker. There is no limit. A dead man has one half hour to raise his
roll outside and get back in the game.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Five grand? Nice, tidy sum. I’ll put out the
same.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: I swear I don’t know what I’m doing sitting
down with you titans, but maybe it’s worth putting up five thousand for
the educational value.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: I’ll play with what I have in my pocket till I
have to send out for more. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight hundred, I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Five G’s, I’m with it. Don’t mean I’m goin’
blow it all, though.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Last and certainly least –</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Seven, nine, trey, nine, ace, and The
Shooter guns up a ten. Ace bets.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Dealer folds.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Call the sawbuck.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>pig’s voice</strong>: Call.</p>
<p><strong>yeller’s voice</strong>: Call.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: King to the seven, pair of nines, deuce to
the trey, queen-nine, ace- eight.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Nines bet twenty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Queen, ten, king, four, ace again, and a
king for The Shooter.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Ace bets ten dollars</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: King over.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Shooter won’t stay on a king or an ace if
there’s another one showing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s he have to have in the hole?</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Ten or better. With no other ten showing.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: New deck.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: Aces over eights. Thank you, gents. Be a laugh
if the two champs ended up cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Any action?</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: What do you expect first five or six
hours?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Still feeling each other out?</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Pig’s ahead about a grand, Shooter maybe
three hundred.</p>
<p><strong>shooter’s voice</strong>: King bets.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: King says twenty.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: In for twenty.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: To the nine a ten, to the queen a seven, to
the king a jack, and to the jack a jack.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Pair of jacks will venture a hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: Up two hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Leave it to the rich folk.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Lancey could be laying for him with three
jacks.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Pig don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>lancey’s voice</strong>: Call the two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: I’m sticking.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Possible straight flush, pair of sevens.
Pair of jacks are still high.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Check to the sevens.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: Bet the size of the pot. Nine hundred and
eighty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: In for nine eighty.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: I’ll play.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s with Lancey? I thought he’d raise with
three jacks or drop with two pair.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: He probably thinks Pig’s faking the queens.
Anyhow, Doc’s liable take them both with a straight or a flush.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Busted, no flush, no straight. Pair of
sevens with a queen gets a nine. To the pair of jacks, a trey.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: Pair of sevens will bet whatever I got here.
Twenty-four hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I’ll call your twenty-four hundred –</p>
<p><strong>lancey’s voice</strong>: – and raise you whatever I have
left.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Comes to fourteen hundred fifty dollars,
Pig. Don’t imagine you’ll have any problem promoting that much in half
an hour – plus whatever you care to raise me.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Fourteen fifty to the queens. You want to
take your half hour, Pig?</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: No, I’m out. Out of the game.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You Tap City?</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: I got a woman.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I thought you and Hilda were quits.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: We’re back.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: See you around, Pig.</p>
<p><strong>players</strong>: So long, Pig – See you – ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: Good luck – Kid.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He shouldn’t have said that. Not after
taking Tap City from the table.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: His woman’s been giving him a rough time. Wants
him to quit and go square.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: At his age? Crazy.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: He wants to wish anybody luck, doesn’t
bother me. Personally, I don’t figure The Kid needs it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thanks, Lancey.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I know it’s early, men, but what about
taking a little break?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It always distresses me, a man reaching his
middle years and still having no assurance of next week’s income.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I know what you mean. I like a man to have
plenty of assurance.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Spider Man died kind of slow. First he
give them a kidney, then his gall bladder, and then they taking his
whole damn stomach. You remember Spider Man, run the dice table down at
Turk’s Club to Memphis.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Who? Oh, Spider Man, sure, sure.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: He died kind of slow.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Need your help, Lady Fingers… to make
arrangements for food and shelter.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Good crowd.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah. Nice-looking broads.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: That’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That was a pretty thing to watch what you done
to Pig with those jacks.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Thanks, Kid. From you, that’s nice to
hear.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: When he bet out first, he was ready to think
you had them back to back. Even when he bet the size of the pot, he
figured there was still a chance you were laying for him. But when you
called him, I could see it in his eyes he thought you had jacks and
tens, and I knew you had him hooked.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: You knew, did you? Before I raised?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh, sure, I seen what you were pulling all
along.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: You been to Miami, Kid?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Beautiful town, lot of loose money around.
You ought to come down some time.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You mean it?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Sure, sure. Lot of room down there. Another
spot you ought to work someday is Reno, Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: You got to have nerves though. So much going
on. Action everywhere you turn. You lose the feel of the cards when
you’re in so much action day in, day out.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’d like to make it out there.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: There’s different levels of action there –
you’d find yours, any kind you could ask for.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I generally stick to stud.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Sure, sure, for eating money. But you know
how it is, I like to lay off once in a while and try craps. Nothing
serious – I don’t even think of it as work.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh, I do that. I’ll take a night off and shoot
a little casino. Or even blackjack.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Your age, you don’t need a regular vacation
every year. But me, I have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks. I
go to this place near Delray Beach, and the whole time I don’t play
anything but bridge.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That’s interesting. I could go for bridge if
there was a way to do it without partners.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I’m not keeping you from your woman, am
I?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No. We’re – she’s gone away for a while. We’re
not sure we’re looking for the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I was hoping Christian would run with me and
wouldn’t try to make a big deal out of it.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: But she tried?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah, and now I don’t know. I don’t figure a
man can change his way because the way I see it a man’s lucky he’s got
something going for him that he can hold on to. A man can’t change his
way for a woman.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Nooo, a man can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I been wondering if it isn’t maybe a better
idea not to look for a fixed thing. Just tie in to something nice when
you’re away from the action, and enjoy it, and let it wear itself
out.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: That’s very interesting you should say that.
You’re pretty young to have figured things out already.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well she didn’t understand how it was with me
and —</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Between us?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: There ain’t but a few people, I guess who would
understand –</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Kid, you’re the best stud man I’ve seen in
35 years of action. You know that?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Well – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: And when it comes to broads, which is
getting to be an academic problem – I can look back now to the two or
three I ever considered I might want to spend the rest of my life with,
and you know what? I like it… looking back on them, that is – I always
got a lot of companionship out of a good book.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It’s very educational, hearing what it’s like
for a man your age.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Glad to be of help. And it’s good we had
this little talk so I know we can be friends regardless what
happens.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That sounds good to me. I didn’t think you was
coming in at me like a grudge match.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: No room for any kind of emotion in a fair
game of stud. I learned that a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers’ voice</strong>: Ready for some action,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: It’s a whole New Deal. Good hands all
around. Prosperity for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: You’re still good, Fingers.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Getting crippled up, Lancey. Not many
of the old gang left. You heard Whistling Sam was gone?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: No, I didn’t hear.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: I was the one got called to the morgue
to identify him. I don’t suppose you seen anybody been run over by a
twelve- ton bulldozer.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: No, can’t say that I have.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Don’t go out of your way.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Bet the pot. Four hundred and twenty
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Fold.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Thanks, gents. Makes me exactly even. This
kind of a game, that’s a smart place to quit. Just do the dealing, if
that’s all right with everybody.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Ace-king is the high man.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Shoot the works. Nine hundred and thirty
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: I’m over.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Doesn’t matter. If you can call me, you beat
me. Ace-king high.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Ace-king-queen high.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: I had them both with a pair of fives.</p>
<p><strong>sokal</strong>: Winds it up for me, men. And I can’t say it’s
been a pleasure. That one I was sure I could steal.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Lancey has a built-in burglar alarm. I’m
also withdrawing from the field of battle, gentlemen. Settle for the
seventeen hundred I’ve already dropped.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Well, just the two of us.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah, just the two of us. Deal them, Shooter
Man.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Cost you a grand.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Compulsory call, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Two pair, jacks up.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Kings up.</p>
<p><strong>lancey’s voice</strong>: Studded again.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Two thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Call two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>lancey’s voice</strong>: Two thousand more.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Take it. I can’t beat three sevens. I’d like a
break to get some food and sleep – I’m winners so it isn’t up to me to
say it but I’m saying it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: My dear, that young man is a stud
poker-playing son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Gettin’ to you, Lancey?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Not yet he isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Now, just what the hell are you trying to
pull?</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Nothing – what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You, Shooter Man – you been feeding me
cards for an hour.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: The hell I was. Christ, Kid, even if I was
you couldn’t spot it – I’m too good a mechanic for anybody to spot
it.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: slamming him against</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You seen it before often enough. One player
draws four good ones.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Never in a game when I been told ahead the
dealer has a stake in my coming out on top.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: My woman told you.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: She told me enough to make me start
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Why should you bitch if I give you a little
help?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Why, you dumb bastard? – You have to ask me
why. I could break you apart for what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Kid, you got to understand. It wasn’t my
idea –</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well who the hell’s was it then –
Schlaegel? –</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He’s got the squeeze on me Kid and he’s
meaner than hell. He’ll cut me up if I don’t come through. You think I
wanted to deal a phony game? You think it don’t mean something to me? I
never done a crooked thing before in my life.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: My ass bleeds for you – Now you get
straight on this. No fix. You come along straight or I blow it wide
open.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He’s liable to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He ain’t goin’ to do nothin’ to you except
pay off because I’m goin’ to win.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: It is a hell of a chance to take.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You got no choice.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He ain’t goin’ to like it.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He ain’t goin’ to know. Shooter, I’m goin’
to win this one – win it my way – and you ride with me or you’re out,
finished.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I ride with you.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You better not forget it – now beat it. I
need some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Tell Mr. Schlaegel I accept his offer to
use the room.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I want to be called at 4 p.m. on the nose.
For sure – Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Not yet he isn’t. But he damn well
might.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Good afternoon, sir. It’s exactly four
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: It’s really only about twenty-five to four.
You can stay right where you are.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I don’t want you to think I’m getting too
personal, but you mind telling me how the hell you come to be here?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: You mean you don’t remember last night? We
drank all that champagne and you said “Let’s get married right away,”
and we chartered a plane to –</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Can it – Where’s Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I locked the door. It’s incredible the way
you invariably worry about The Shooter.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: It’s incredible the way you invariably
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Worrying takes time and we don’t have a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: We’re supposed to sit down again at half
past four.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Does it really matter so much to you now,
that sense of obligation to The Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I got no obligations to The Shooter. Or to
you.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Obligations are not what I have in mind.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Reach me a towel?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: You any idea how much The Shooter has
involved in this game of yours?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: If Schlaegel bet as much on me as I heard,
I guess he’d pay a nice piece of change to be sure I won.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: It’s worse than that. Schlaegel staked him
for three years. He has his hooks so deep in Shooter Man, he’ll take out
his liver when he pulls them out.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You asking me to go along with the fix?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: I’m asking you to consider whether your ego
is worth destroying another man’s whole life.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You’re still working for him. On my time
you’re still working for him.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: What kind of switch is this? You criticize me
for trying to chippie on him, then I get a little loyal and you’re at me
for that.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: No – I don’t hold it against you. You
wanting to make things right for him – but this game I handle my way –
win, lose, or draw.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed
hero.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Believe me Kid there is too much at stake for
us to rely on your doing it on your own.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Hello, Kid. Hello, Melba. You said wait
home ’til you let me know.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I said. We took a break
in the game to catch some sleep. Shooter sent his woman up here to wake
me up.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Yeah, I woke him up.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: It don’t take much.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: No, I didn’t find it any trouble. Well, you
children don’t need me, that’s for sure. See you downstairs. You, too,
honey, right?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I’ll be around if The Kid wants me.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: See you, Melba. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Por nada, as they say. It was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You been to the place?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: No, I’ve got my bag downstairs. Maybe
I’ll take it over later on tonight.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: How’s your Mama and Papa?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Fine. How’s the game going?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: It’s come to be just me and Lancey.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I was wondering.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I got my mind on the cards.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I know. And I don’t want to rattle you.
We got plenty to talk about, but it can all wait. Except I want to say
this. I came back because I figured if it was going to work with us,
it’s silly me sitting home with Mama while you’re playing your big game.
I mean if I’m any use to you at all, this is when it’s most
important.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’m glad you came, Christian. You got as
much right here as anybody. More right, I should have said.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Should you?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Hell, yes. The change I come out with when
I win this one, you’re going to be the one to spend it.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Eric –</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Look, I said I’m glad you came – and that’s
all until I wrap this up – I’m a poker player, remember?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: The eight’ll try two bills.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: No stay.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: No stay.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Naaa, Kid paired kings. He wins a
hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Queen bets another C-note.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Take it away.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Go read a magazine, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers’ voice</strong>: All right, gents. I’m declaring
a break.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: I break.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I don’t want a break.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Well, I don’t either.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Same deck is good enough.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I want a new deck.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Alright, alright – A new deck then,
Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: You want to deal? Then deal them
yourselves. I’m going to the john. I’m going to get something to eat,
and I’m going to take a nap. You barracudas can snap all you want but at
each other – I’m taking a break and if you don’t like it you can both go
to hell.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I guess we been told.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: See you in about 3/4 of an hour, Lancey,
right?</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Make it an hour. Old bones need a little
more time to loosen up.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Listen, I think it is amazing you’ve been
able to keep going this long.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Eric –</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Your fan on the fifth floor wants you to
have a bite with him. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: There’s nothing to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: You better, Kid. You don’t, you’re only
making worse trouble.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: If you think so. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Nothing, Nothing you have to worry about.
I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Get something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I thought it would be better if you and I sat
down together to see if we couldn’t work out our differences. Felix!</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What I told The Shooter goes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Are you saying no before we’ve even discussed
it? Am I to feel all my arguments will be wasted?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll skip to the final argument. More salad,
perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The Shooter will be back dealing when you
start again. He will give you an occasional helpful card.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: That’s an argument?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s a fact. I’m coming to the argument.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’ll give you a fact. I won’t let it
happen.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Is that knife sharp enough? Felix.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: See if it cuts better with that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sharp?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Very. But it don’t cut any ice with me.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Not this time. He exits.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Did you eat?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Why not, for Chris sakes?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Eric –</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You should eat something.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I’ve got to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Talk.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: It’s – about us. What’s going to
happen?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What’s going to happen? What’s going to
happen for Chris sake is I’m going to win the game. You go back to the
apartment, honey, this might take two more days.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: If I go, I’m not going back to the
apartment. If I go – I’m just going.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, that’s up to you, Christian.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I told you, Shooter – I won’t go for
it.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: The Shooter’s not well. He didn’t want to
spoil the game, but he ought to be resting… He ought to be in the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Well, we got Lady Fingers. Or we can deal
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: I’m okay. What The Kid’s talking about is
nothing. It’s just not important.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: It is to me… You want to kill yourself, do
it on your own time.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I got to go along with that, Shooter. Lady
Fingers! You ready?</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Like Eddie the Dude said on his
deathbed, I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I can’t persuade myself you have the
flush.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Now I can.</p>
<p><strong>lancey’s voice</strong>: I’m going to pay the price to look
at that third nine.</p>
<p><strong>lancey’s voice</strong>: Caveat emptor. New deck, please.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Pair of eights bets an even thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Ten bucks and my notoriously fallible
instinct tells me the boy is bluffing this time.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Mark it.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I’m not that curious.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: The Kid is pushing it and making it
stick.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He’s getting to him.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: And up five.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Fold.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Betting the jack isn’t there, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: We’re in – I think he’s got him.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: A jack and a ten. Jack bets.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Jack is willing to wager two hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: And up five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Call your five hundred and five hundred
more.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Call.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Fifty to one hundred says Lancey paired his
jacks.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Mark it.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Pair of tens. Jack, ten of hearts.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Your five hundred – and up one thousand.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: Fifty to seventy-five he’s got the jacks
wired.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: Mark it – Could be a high heart. Queen’s the
best, but that old man can be cocky with an ace or a deuce. ’Specially
having one of The Kid’s tens.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: One thousand to the tens.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Call.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: A third ten, and a nine of hearts to
the ten, jack.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: He’ll run. He’s beat on the board anyway you
look at it. Even if he has the jacks it is better than eight to one
against improving.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: He won’t run and I don’t think he’s got the
jacks. I think he’s going for the flush.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Two thousand, five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Two thousand, five hundred dollars to
the three hearts.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Reasonable bet. Two thousand five hundred.
Deal them.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: He’s going for it and The Kid’s got him.
He’s going all the way.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: A queen of diamonds to the three tens.
And an eight of hearts to the possible flush. Possible straight flush.
Three tens bet.</p>
<p><strong>hoban</strong>: If The Kid bets into the flush he’s filled up
with a queen in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>yeller</strong>: If The Man has a flush or a straight, he
goes under. But not with both.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Bet what’s in front of me. Make it
fifty-four hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice piece of
money. I see the bet and raise sixty-seven hundred.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Kid has him, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m taking my half hour to raise my stake.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: I declare a thirty-minute break. Leave
your cards and money on the table. The game will start again at five
forty-five.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I’ll take your marker, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I can raise it.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I know you can.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Long as you know. – Call.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Straight flush to the jack – That’s $6700
you owe me, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: New deck.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Are you playing, Kid? You got a half
an hour to raise your stake.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No – I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Gentlemen, this game is over.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: You’re one hell of a poker player, Kid. That
was a rough hand.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: What’s the tab for the whole show?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: You had to do it, didn’t you – you had to go
for it your own way. Well, sonny, I hope you learned something. I know
we sure as hell did.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Where’s Christian?</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: She’s gone. She’s got too much sense to stick
with a two bit loser.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Shut up. Sorry, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah. I should have known he had it, Shooter
Man. I walked into it.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Schlaegel and Felix</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Are you ready, Shooter Man? We’re having a
meeting and I suggest you join us.</p>
<p><strong>melba</strong>: Why me – I’m not part of this.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Oh, yes you are – you and your big mouth –
you’re part of it all right.</p>
<p><strong>schlaegel</strong>: He’s right, my dear. Now run along with
Felix. We’re going to have a long talk about that big mouth of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>schlaegel</strong>: I was wrong. I figured you for brains.
But you’re a loser, Kid. You had a chance to play with grownups and you
ran. They weren’t playing your game. They were playing mine. Think about
that while you find a place to hide. But hide good, Kid – because I got
a message for you and I’m going to see it delivered.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>lady fingers</strong>: Never thought I’d see the day. You
raising tens on a lousy three-flush.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Gets down to what it’s all about, doesn’t
it? Making the wrong play at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: That’s what it’s all about? You were crazy
– odds are three hundred to one against.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: I don’t play a percentage game. I play stud
poker my way. And I got the money and you got the questions. Figure that
out. You’re good. But as long as I’m around, you’re second best, Kid…
and you might as well learn to live with it.</p>
<p><strong>lancey</strong>: Look me up if you’re in Miami after
Christmas. Stillson Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: During the progression of the game first one,
then two, then all four men will be included among the observers. Always
in the background, never positively identified. Their presence should be
felt if not recognized.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So it ain’t Eric Stone, from the foundry.
It’s the Cincinnati Kid King of the stud poker players.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: No – not the King – not much of anything
right now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’ll start with giving you back what you
gave me.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Eric –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tell her good-bye, sport. You ain’t going any
place.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’m fine. Weren’t you going to say
good-bye?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: I said good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Yeah, I guess you did. You don’t know if I
won or lost do you?</p>
<p><strong>christian</strong>: No – it doesn’t really matter. I love
you, Kid – and it’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Listen, Lady, it’s coming on the
morning rush. I got to have one fare after another or I’m behind for the
day.</p>
