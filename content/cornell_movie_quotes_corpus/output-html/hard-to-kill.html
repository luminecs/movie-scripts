<p><strong>final draft</strong>: February 17, 1989</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Daddy! I don’t want you to go!</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Your father has work to do, Sonny … but
he’ll be home soon. And we’ll all watch it together.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: You promise, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Daddy … Daddy, is E.T. gonna win?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: He’s got my vote.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: I want you back early. Tonight’s the night
those little starlets are crawling all over town.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll beat ’em off with a
stick.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Daddy What about my joke?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Knock knock.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Old lady.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Old lady who?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I didn’t know you could yodel.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Take my advice: Don’t give up your day
job.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Karl … wake up.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’m here, Mase. Where are you</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: On the Harbor … south of Torrance. I got
Calabrese right in my gunsights.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: If I had a Sidewinder missile, I could save
the taxpayers a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Here he goes. I’m shutting down the radio,
partner.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Keep off the skyline, amigo. Lou Gossett just
won Best Supporting.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Let’s go, boys. I’m missing the Oscars.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I know you, Calabrese. But who are these
mystery guests?</p>
<p><strong>calabrese</strong>: – Murder is a serious business, my
friend. And an expensive one.</p>
<p><strong>shadow man with hat</strong>: You’ll be well compensated,
Calabrese. Money now – and a lot more when I get into that office. You
can take that to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>calabrese</strong>: Slowly … slowly. Always with caution.</p>
<p><strong>shadow man with hat</strong>: I’m up to here with caution!
That fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa sprouts – he ain’t gonna die of
natural causes.</p>
<p><strong>calabrese</strong>: All I’m counseling is a little patience.
The man is public. He’s in the paper every day.</p>
<p><strong>shadow man with hat</strong>: Yeah? Well, the next time I
read about him, it better be in the obituaries.</p>
<p><strong>bareheaded shadow man</strong>: Enough bullshit. Can you do
the job or not? If you can’t -</p>
<p><strong>vitale</strong>: We’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Who are you? Get out of those shadows –</p>
<p><strong>shadow man with hat</strong>: The job is a light plane … a
Lear P61. We want it to take off – we don’t want it to land.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: You told us this dock was clean –</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: A quarter’s a quarter.</p>
<p><strong>calabrese</strong>: Mikey! Quit playing with yourself back
there. Mikey –</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Whoever that sonofabitch is, I don’t want him
to get an hour older.</p>
<p><strong>calabrese</strong>: He won’t, Mr. Assemblyman.</p>
<p><strong>dunne</strong>: Karl – Storm on three.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You throwing away dimes now?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: This doesn’t go out over the air, pal. For
your ears only.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What’s going down?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Calabrese. I just got his ass – on candid
camera.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You’re full of shit!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Him and his gorilla Vitale. I got film and
audio on both of them, laying out a hit. Two other guys I couldn’t make
out, but I’m sure they’ll come up on the film. This is a big one,
Carlito. Our own academy award. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I want you to track down Morgensteen right
now. If he’s with that meter maid from Pico, crank her legs apart and
pry him out of there.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He ain’t gonna be happy.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Screw his happiness. Tell him I want the lab
open at six-thirty tomorrow morning. I want this film pushed to the max,
and nobody but us to know about it. I know we got something here.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You bringing it in tonight?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I promised my kid I’d be home. I’ll be at the
lab before dawn.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: How ya doing? Got any champagne?</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Right next to the caviar. There’s some
in the big cooler.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You’re not watching the Oscars?</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: The Oscars? I hate the Oscars.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Who needs the goddam movies? I get it
all in here every night. Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence. And I ain’t
gotta pay no four bucks.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You got a phone back there?</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Why ?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Punch nine-one-one.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped me off
two weeks ago!</p>
<p><strong>shotgun punk</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Take it, man. Take my life’s
savings.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Where is a cop when you goddam need
one? I got half a mind to come out there and teach you sonofabitch –</p>
<p><strong>shotgun punk</strong>: Now you got half a mind, old man.</p>
<p><strong>shotgun punk</strong>: What are you grinning at, pindejo?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: We … ell … there’s only three of you and you
only got one shot left.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I know what you’re thinking. I have this big
shotgun and all you have is that little icepick. Mine’s bigger than
yours. It’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Still not fair?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Don’t wait for the blindfold, maricon.</p>
<p><strong>punk #3</strong>: Chinga tu madre!</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: You were armed, Storm – why didn’t you
just use your gun?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I just got these new glazer bullets. You know
they’re almost a buck a pop now?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I know that voice.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Wish I could sleep like that.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Maybe I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Is that for me, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You faker.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: E.T. lost.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Who won?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I dunno. Candy.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Candy?</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Mahatma Candy. He was a great man.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You know why E.T. lost?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Cause they only let grownups vote. If kids
had voted –</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: – We would have gave E.T. everything!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: We would have given him everything.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Daddy – tell me a knock-knock.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You know the rules. One joke a day. I have to
make ’em last.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: There’s blood on your jacket.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: It’s okay. It’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: If people knew how sweet you are, they’d
never be scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: I’m not scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Maybe you should be.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: increasing</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: A couple of things crossed my mind, in the
car coming home.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Door’s open.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>little man</strong>: Man.</p>
<p><strong>big man</strong>: Get to work.</p>
<p><strong>little man</strong>: You got the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>big man</strong>: grabbed from</p>
<p><strong>dunne</strong>: Punch it.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: knew Storm from when I was City Attorney …
and he was a young homicide detective - We worked on… cases … together …
I’m sorry … sorry –</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: That was Assemblyman Vernon Trent,
deeply moved by the loss of an officer he knew, .</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: What makes people do this? Will you tell me?
Will someone please tell me?!!</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Holland! Captain Holland!</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: They always said Storm was superhuman. Now
we know why he was always jacked up on coke!</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Let me tell you something, you piss- ant.
That man in there was the cleanest I ever knew – with more honor and
guts than this whole department put together. If I ever hear you say
fuck all like that again, I’ll lose my shield to put you where you
belong.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: What the hell’s I.A. doing up at this
hour?</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Taking over the show.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: We got two cops down, with money and drugs
all over the place. This is straight from the commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You and Storm were tight, O’Malley. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: He was the most unstoppable sonofabitch I
ever knew.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>e.r. doctor</strong>: Excuse me, are you with the police?</p>
<p>****: Lieutenant O’Malley. What’ve you got, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>e.r. doctor</strong>: I’ve got a live cop, is what I’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>e.r. doctor</strong>: The paramedics called it wrong, so did
my people at first. Look… it happens. The man had no vital signs. With
all the blood and excitement, I almost missed it myself. But we have a
pulse now. Your man is alive, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Who else knows he isn’t dead?</p>
<p><strong>e.r. doctor</strong>: No one … just the people in her. But
–</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: I want to see each one of them before they
leave the room. No one else comes in as of right now.</p>
<p><strong>e.r. doctor</strong>: Hold on. I don’t think you –</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Mason Storm is going to vanish, Doctor –
and you’re gonna help make it happen. Until he can give us some answers,
the deader he is, the safer he is.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: – The governor today appointed dashing
L.A. Assemblyman Vernon Trent to the Senate seat vacated by the tragic
death of –</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’re early again.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You won’t report me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Inquiring minds want to know –</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: – Dr. Cannon ordered a glucose drip on Jimmy
See. Mack’s E.E.G. monitor’s developing a nice electronic hiccup – and
your boyfriend… … turned his head.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I thought he was going to sit up. I almost
shit!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: compassion and</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m going to talk to you tonight… and tomorrow
night … and the night after that. I’m going to keep talking to you till
you come back –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yogi said it ain’t over till it’s over. Till
the fat lady sings. There’s life in you, J.D., I feel it. I’ll never
give up on you, and you’ll never give up on yourself –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Besides … you’ve got so much to live for.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sorry. I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How’s the sleeping prince?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Still sleeping. It’s bad enough when it’s old
people. But a young handsome guy –</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Don’t let this job get you, honey. It’s
eight hours, not twenty-four. Get out, meet somebody … get laid –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You can have my orgasms, Martha. I’ll make up
for ’em later.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: – Nurse …</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Internal affairs. Detective Sergeant
Jones.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My name is Andrea Simpson. I’m calling from
U.C.I. Medical Center. I’d like to speak with Captain O’Malley.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What is this in regard to, please?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I have a John Doe coma patient, code access
461 zebra, with instructions to notify upon any change in condition.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What is the change?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The patient has regained consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Nolan. Get Holland at home … right now. I’m
sorry, Ms. Simpson. Captain O’Malley is no longer with this division.
Let me take your information. Please … contact no one else on this
matter.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: – Clip him with 50 cc of Thorazine if he
gives you any trouble. I’m afraid he’s very disoriented and quite
paranoid. He thinks people are trying to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Miss … please … they won’t tell me … think
I’m too disorient –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: This is U.C.I. Medical Center. You’ve been in
a coma. Your charts go back for seven years.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Seven… years?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Who … who knows I’m awake?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s all over the hospital. You’re the first
one that’s come out of a coma of this duration. You’ll probably be on
the news! You’ll be famous!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Listen to me carefully – – Andy. I don’t have
the strength to talk much. I’m a cop. My wife … family … murdered.
That’s how I got here. If you don’t get me out … you and I … good chance
… both be dead.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Please – you’re in no danger here.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Goddamit – can’t stay here. Listen to me
-</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ll have one of the aides take you down the
hall for hydrotherapy. It’ll help you relax.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Listen… I’ve got work to do. You’re my cutest
patient, but you’re not my only one.</p>
<p><strong>russ</strong>: Excuse me, Doctor. I have to check everyone on
the upper floors. Can I just get your I.D. –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Russ! Russ, are you –</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My God!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: – Help me …</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m sorry! Sorry –</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Six gang-related murders in one week. We’re
going to put a stop to it – and we’re going to start right here!</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I’ll be talking with the mayor. We’ll have a
statement shortly –</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: How much dirt do I have to shovel into this
goddam Storm’s grave?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Jesus Christ! The man is flat out on a
stretcher and you still can’t kill him!</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Holland – plaster his ass with slime in the
press. Put a tail on every person he knows –</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: We know how to do our job, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Then start showing it. I’m starring in that
sonofabitch’s home movie – and the Oscar is thirty years in the slammer.
He’s toast, understand?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: We’re going to end violence in this state –
and you can take that to the bank!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Seven years.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: – Stay tuned for more of: Best of
Geraldo!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Geraldo?</p>
<p><strong>ad</strong>: Senator Vernon Trent promises: No new taxes!</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: And you can take that to the bank!</p>
<p><strong>female spokesperson</strong>: – If you want to sleep with me
… you better wear a Pharoah.</p>
<p><strong>male announcer</strong>: Pharoah condoms. The only safer sex
is no sex at all!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: can’t come in to work, are you crazy?! I can’t
even go to my apartment! People are dead, Martha … no, I can’t tell you
where I am … you’re better off not knowing –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I am freaking A.W.O.L. I mean, what am I gonna
do with this guy – I want to help him… my God, he needs it … but it’s
all over the T.V., he’s some kind of crooked cop with drugs and murder
and –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s okay – I’m here, I’m with you.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Yeah, that Esposito. The ignorant fuck who’s
broadcasting the news right now. Tell him it’s Storm. Mason Storm.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I can’t stay here. They’ll trace you from the
hospital in two –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I told you – no one knows I’m here! I’m
house-sitting… This place belongs to a doctor friend of my parents. He’s
in China now, on research… won’t be back for six months. The medical
center only has my apartment address. Even my friends don’t have this
number. Will you believe me?! We’re safe here.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Esposito? Listen, you sonofabitch –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’ll find your friend O’Malley. We’ll just
keep phoning …</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Listen. I’m getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ll buy tickets to that.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I just need some food – and a few days to get
my strength.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Days? Try a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You helped me, okay? I’m grateful. But every
day you keep helping puts you in more danger.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Danger is my middle name.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’ve been dead, Andy. You wouldn’t like
it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, hey – I don’t think you get the picture
here. Your muscles have been getting electronic stimulation at the
hospital, but it’s not like actually being up and bearing weight.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You’re the one who doesn’t get the
picture.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: First of all, I ain’t no fucking invalid! And
second, I don’t have time –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mata Hari – at your service.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Just some herbs I need for my recovery.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No problem. This is on my list for Safeway
every day.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: That bad … huh?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ll be in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>esposito</strong>: – This reporter was contacted personally
by the now-infamous ‘Coma Cop’… fugitive officer Mason Storm – who until
days ago had languished in a seven-year coma.</p>
<p><strong>esposito</strong>: Storm gave me his word that he is innocent
of all charges preferred against him in the press – and that he has
access to indisputable proof of this. Battling the atrophy caused by
seven years of hospitalization, Storm is struggling even now to regain
the strength that will enable him to come forward with this evidence. He
has promised me and the K.A.B.C. audience a first look at his alleged
proof.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I want 24-hour surveillance on this
sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I told you – Andy’s out of town. I just came
by to pick up her cat.</p>
<p><strong>dunne</strong>: Where out of town is Andy?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I don’t know. Look, I’ve been questioned by
you cops half a dozen times since Tuesday. I’m getting a little tired of
it. You need a warrant to walk in on someone like this. Get the hell
out.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Then I’ll get out.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We’ll ask you again, Martha: Where is Miss
Simpson?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’m calling your superior officers to report
this. I want both your names and shield numbers.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Help? Help me!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s enough! I don’t care how many needles
you stick in yourself or how much ginseng root you eat … you have to
sleep if you’re going to recover.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I slept for seven years?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Jesus – what a patient!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: – You can’t compare blood pressure readings
now with when you were in a coma. It’s not going to give a true measure
–</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: What’s this reading? 555 over four digits
–</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s crazy –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s Martha’s chicken scratches. Even she
can’t read ’em.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’ll tell you what it is. It’s a phone
number.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Redondo Beach Retirement Villa</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m. sorry … maybe I have the wrong number.
I’m looking for Kevin O’Malley.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: O’Malley? There’s no O’Malley here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My name is Phyllis O’Connor. I’m with the
pension board of the Los Angeles Police Department. We have a misplaced
check here for Captain O’Malley …</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: A check? Well, listen… there’s a big
turnover here, people are dying all the time, I never know who’s in what
bed. Can you leave me your number?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m sorry, we’re not allowed to do that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mrs. Wade, I’ll be honest with you – I’m not
from the police pension board. My name is Andrea Simpson, I’m a nurse
from U.C.I. Medical Center.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You probably have no connection to this, and
what I’m about to say</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: will sound completely absurd to you. My
patient is a police officer named Mason Storm. He’s in trouble and needs
desperately to contact his friend, Captain O’Malley. If you have any
idea how to contact Captain O’Malley, please help me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wade</strong>: As I’ve said, Miss Simpson, I’ve already
asked everybody in the home. There is no O’Malley here. But it’s
possible O’Malley could be a relative of somebody living here. Sunday is
family day. Why don’t you leave your phone number and I’ll contact you
if I learn anything.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Can I phone you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wade</strong>: Of course, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: This is my number, Mrs. O’Malley.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wade</strong>: You mean Mrs. Wade. O’Malley is the
person you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes … you’re right. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry … I didn’t mean to interrupt. I,
ah, well, I was just passing by and …</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’m sorry – Sorry. I –</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Why am I still in this fucking cage?! What’s
wrong with my body? Why won’t it heal faster?!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mason, please I love you.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Don’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Why not?!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Because I can’t love you! Don’t you see? It’s
seven years to anyone else. But it’s only days for me.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: How can I be with you … how can I want you
and take you, when –</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You seduced me. You came in here, looking
that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted you –</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You have no right to want me!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Then who does?! I’ve risked my life for you
–</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Who asked you to? Not me!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You haven’t stopped me!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Then don’t risk it! Don’t do shit for me! I
don’t need you!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Pick up, Martha … Pick up.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Get a hold of yourself, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re really beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Martha! Martha, it’s me –</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: You looking for Martha Coe?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes… yes –</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: You haven’t seen the news? She’s dead.
They shot her in the back… over in Westwood.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: You look like the woman’s picture on T.V…
the one whose house they shot her at –</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You called it right, Max. The bitch showed.
I’m on her ass right now – Mount up, boys. Two to one she leads us right
to our boy Storm.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That’s grand theft, auto.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: O’Malley.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: – It’s Sonny, all right. Believe how big
he got? He can throw a football forty yards –</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: He made it to my house, the night you got
shot. I hid him, played it out like he was dead – even staged a funeral,
along with Felicia’s and yours. They bought it. Everyone believed he was
dead.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Where is he now? Is he safe?</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Trinity School in Ventura. Under my
mother’s maiden name, Wade. No one has any idea he’s your son.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Then that was your mother. The one Andy
found.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Your nurse friend? Yeah. She left your
number, I traced you to here.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: O’Mal … I can never thank you.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Just seeing your ugly ass alive, that’s
enough for me. You wouldn’t happen to have a beer around this joint
–</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’d give my left arm to see Sonny, just for
two minutes. But we can’t risk it – not yet. Not till I get
Calabrese.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Calabrese? Calabrese’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Someone blew the shit out of his Cadillac
– six months after you ‘died.’</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: He did his thing – then they waxed him.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: The two guys at the pier. They ordered the
hit on me too. And I’ve got ’em on film. Still in the camera, right
where I left it.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: – That night in the hospital, I found the
audiotape … in your vest. I must’ve listened to it a thousand times –
looking for little quirks in the voices, phrases they repeat …</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Where is the tape?</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: I turned it in for evidence.</p>
<p><strong>0’malley</strong>: Don’t worry, I made a duve. I’ll get it
for you. Meanwhile maybe this’ll cheer you up.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: What happened, O’Mal? To you?</p>
<p><strong>0’malley</strong>: I was on the case, trying to find who
pulled the trigger on you. But it was like swimming through shit. People
kept telling me to back off. Then one morning, the phone rings.
Immaculate Heart Emergency: someone ran my mother off the road, her
back’s broken, she’s paralyzed.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’m sorry, O’Mal.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: That night there’s a note in my locker –
letting me know it’s not an accident.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: You know me, Storm. I never would’ve
backed off. But there was Sonny to worry about too. What if they found
him? What if they found you?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You did the right thing, O’Mal.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: We’ll get ’em, buddy. Every fucking one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Get Sonny out of that school, O’Mal. Right
now. With me alive and making a stink, whoever’s on that film is going
to be looking harder than ever for Sonny – just to get to me. Get him
someplace safe … three thousand miles away if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Consider it done.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’m going straight to get that film. When
you’ve got Sonny safe, bring me the audiotape. We’ll put ’em together
and get ’em to Esposito for the T.V. news. That should be quite a
show.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: You got it, partner. You can always reach
me through my mother. What about that nurse? She still in this?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Gone. For the best. For her best.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Thanks for the brew!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’m gonna take you to the bank, Senator
Trent. The blood bank.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Martha’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I won’t leave you. Not ever again.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I won’t let you.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: O’Malley was here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Here? How did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You found him. The old lady was his mother.
And Andy … my son’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I know this fuck. He’s a cop!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Holland! The other man on the dock –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you crazy?! Get us outa here –</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: We just made the top of the chart, Andy.
Every cop in the city thinks we shot our way out of a legitimate bust
–</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: There are no cops here!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Only ’cause they’re too stupid. We need that
film and we don’t need any bullshit –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Goddamit … for once, do something the
non-violent way!</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: – Gee, my husband and I aren’t really
thinking about selling. In fact, we’re adding a nursery –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, that’s the best time for us to see it!
Then when you do come to sell, our office will know the upgrades you’ve
made and we can market your home more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Hell, come on in. Everyone else does.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: New wall … fucking yuppies!</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Just checking for termites He tucks the
camera case under his arm – takes Andy by the elbow.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Better have this place fumigated – quick.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: O’Malley left his mother’s place three hours
ago – with the tape. He should be at the school by now, but she hasn’t
heard back from him.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Fuck the tape. We gotta get this film to
Esposito or I’m gonna have a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Mrs. O’Malley. Sorry … listen. We’re outside
the Century Plaza now … the hotel. Right, right. The one in Century
City. Okay, listen closely … Tell O’Mal to leave a message for us at the
hotel desk. Leave it for Andy … Andrea Smith. We’re not gonna check in,
it’s too dangerous – but the desk will hold the message if you tell them
we’re coming in this afternoon. Got it? Great. You’re a champ,
Mrs. ‘0.’</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You’re gonna call Esposito. But not from this
phone.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Hey, hermano! You want this Jeep?</p>
<p><strong>youth #1</strong>: How hot is it?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Fuckin’ smoking.</p>
<p><strong>youth #1</strong>: We got it, my man.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Esposito won’t be here yet. He said
three-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: He’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Try O’Malley one more time. If you hear any
lions roaring, haul ass.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m a big boy.</p>
<p><strong>security-type</strong>: Someone wants to talk to you,
Storm.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: What a day, huh? Beautiful! Want some
nuts?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I haven’t got the film on me.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I didn’t think you would. Sit down. Take a
load off.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: You do have the film somewhere, I assume?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Developed yet?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Still in the camera.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Good. Very good. That way I know you haven’t
duplicated it.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You know, Trent … I could rip your fucking
throat out before that sonofabitch over there could find the spit to
sneeze.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Oh, I’m sure you could, Storm. But not before
one of those other gentlemen, across the way, could put a fifty-caliber
slug through your brainpan.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Very well placed, Trent. But did you know
that human reaction time – even the fastest – is between half and
three-quarters of second? And in that time, I could easily –</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: You could kill me now, Storm – but you’ll die
two seconds later.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You think I care, motherfucker? Just so I get
you – one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>dunne</strong>: Maybe you care about this, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Reach into my jacket pocket. Reach in!</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I want that film and the tape. I’ll give you
three hours.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Just tell me one thing. Who pulled the
trigger on me and my wife?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Hate poisons people. Let go of it.</p>
<p><strong>dunne</strong>: I missed your kid seven years ago. But I
won’t miss tonight.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Bring that film, Mr. Storm. Three hours.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: It’s fun, huh, kid? Kinda like a field
trip.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I’m remembering both of you. And when my dad
gets here –</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: He’s gonna have a long trip, kid – starting
from Forest Lawn.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: By the time this night’s over, your old
man’ll have a use for that phony grave of his.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Yeah… yeah – we’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: We’ll come back with your French fries. Don’t
leave home without us.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Malley!</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: It’s okay, sport. It’s okay… it’s okay
–</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Is that a steering wheel – or a Winchell’s
donut?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I need to check any messages for a Miss
Andrea Smith.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m sorry. I see no slot for that name
–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She hasn’t checked in yet. But she’s due
here. Someone might have left a message for her.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Here it is. There’s just one
message.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You can put this back now. You never saw me.
You never saw these guys.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sonny got away! He’s with O’Malley! O’Malley’s
gat the tape – they’re heading for Union Station.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Get the goddam cars!</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Be careful you don’t get any of that guck
on your sweater … let me comb your hair before your old man gets here,
it’s stinking up in the back.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Quit it, will you … you’re making me more
nervous than I am already. My father’s going to be more interested in
seeing the real me.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: I think I’m more nervous than you are,
kid. We got out of my mother’ place about two shakes ahead of the
landlord … know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: My dad’ll get ’em. You guys’ll nail them all.
You think he’s gonna like me?</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Does a bear dump in the woods? Are you
kidding – he’s gonna love you.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Let me see the tickets. Did you get us one of
those sleeping cars? What time is he getting here anyway?</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Soon…</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Hey, O’Malley! Long time no see. Taking a
trip somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Make sure your father gets this … Yeah. Me
and my son are visiting my mother in New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Your son, huh? That’s funny. He doesn’t look
much like you – Does he, Turner?</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: Looks a lot like Mason Storm.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Enough of this fucking around. We want the
tape.</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Sonny – run!</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: Go! Sonny – get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Get the kid! He’s under the cars!</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: Give us the tape, kid – and we’ll take you
home.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Fuck you, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>o’malley</strong>: You don’t deserve to wear your badge. with
his last failing strength, O’Malley raises the tire iron. Nolan PUMPS
him once, square in the chest, killing him.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s a good question. Out of here for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Where are we going? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s a long story. You got a few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>dunne</strong>: What do we have to do, Holland drive a
fucking stake through his heart?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’ll settle for a bullet.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You had him point-blank seven years ago,
and he’s still walking!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: He won’t be for long. Not with his picture on
every T.V. in –</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Fuck his picture! Get off your asses –
Start earning your money!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: How’s the action, boys? Mind if I play?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I know what you guys are thinking. You’re
thinking I couldn’t play with this gun in my hand. Right?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Well? Somebody hand me a cue.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: That’s for my wife. Fuck you and die.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I want Dunne and the others here. That
goddamn Storm is nuts enough to come after me –</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: He’s nuts – but not that nuts.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: How does it feel to know you’re about to
die?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: I’ll give you more time than you and Trent
gave my wife.</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: for Trent to</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I
can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too
merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you
in a federal penitentiary … – let me put it this way – I doubt whether
you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah… I think that’s best
for you –</p>
<p><strong>calabrese</strong>: Murder is a serious business, my friend.
And an expensive one.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: I’m up to here with caution! This lives on
alfalfa sprouts and bean curd, he ain’t gonna die of natural cause.</p>
<p><strong>calabrese</strong>: All I’m counseling is a little patience.
The man is public. He’s in the paper every day.</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Yeah? Well, the next time I read about him,
it better be in the obituaries.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey … Seven year Storm! I told you you’d be
famous.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey! Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Knock, knock.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: Boo.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Boo who?</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You don’t have to cry about it. I love you
both.</p>
