<h1 id="mission-impossible-ii">mission-impossible-ii</h1>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s this, then?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: The ashes of a colleague, I’m taking
them to his family. If you wish to open it, please be careful.</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: - folks, we’re a little over two
and a half hours from touchdown in Atlanta, but if you look out your
windows on either side of the aircraft, we’ll soon be crossing the
southern section of the Rocky Mountains, a range which includes more
than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet. The chain’s loftiest point,
Mount Elbert, at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view as we pass over
central Colorado shortly..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You keep staring at that watch as if your
life depended on it, Doctor..</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: Well, yes. I suppose I am a bit
anxious.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: They’re ready and waiting. You’ll soon be
with old friends.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: I’m with an old friend now, Dmitri.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sorry it couldn’t be under happier
circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: Yes, I’m sorry too.. ‘You’re sorry and
I’m sorry..’ - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He was quite a man. Did he know before the
end you two had succeeded?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: Yes, he knew. Just..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: ..not in time to save him.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: No. After you’ve lived with Chimera for
twenty hours, nothing can save you. Not even…Bellerophon.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You carry them together? Safely?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: Yes, and you’ll get us to a safe place
with them, thank god!..left to my own devices, I’m an old fart too inept
to read a railroad timetable!..</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: You Captain again. We’ve
experienced a slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Pan, pan, pan, Denver Center. This is Trans
Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven, 747 heavy. We are not reading you. We’re
unable to maintain cabin pressurization. We have initiated a descent to
one six thousand.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Captain, I don’t..can’t..</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: ..it seems we have a problem,
Dmitri.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You keep calling me Dmitri. You really
shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: You’re not Dmitri?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: - no.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: - pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it’s
potential evidence..</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: All done, chief..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: - right - - don’t go too far ahead of me
now -</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Not possible..</p>
<p><strong>wallis</strong>: Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus
two-zero-thousand. Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: It’s that time. Go.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Terrain, terrain. Pull up, pull up.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Whoaa..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>electronic voice</strong>: Identity confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck’s voice</strong>: Your mission, should you choose to
accept it, requires you to recover a stolen item, designated Chimera.
Essential to the mission is the recruitment of a civilian – a Miss Nyah
Nordoff-Hall. She is a highly capable professional thief currently
active in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If I let you know where I’m going -</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Do you know me?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: No. Should I?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No. You just looked as if you did.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: No. Just as if I’d like to.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry -</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: There’s not enough time in the world for any
of it to be bad.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Look, it’s either you or the rent and I don’t
mind telling you it’s not an easy choice.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What if I pay the rent?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Uh-huh?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Go find the wealthy lady you came with and
next time we meet - I’ll pay your rent. Now bugger off.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Decisions, decisions.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Think you’re the only one who can pick a
lock?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I see. You’re not just another pretty
face..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I take it you prefer tenors.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Would you mind if I’m on top?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Oh, either way works for me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: You’re never gonna find it there.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Damn it! Find what?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: His ex-wife’s Bulgari necklace that goes up
for auction Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: - right..where is it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Far right.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Where’s the bloody -</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: offering it up like a mechanic</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: - this is very disconerting..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hey, you put me here. I just do what I’m
told.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: - right..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: That.</p>
<p><strong>senor de l’arena</strong>: Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is
you! It’s Senor Keyes, the security engineer.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, Senor de l’Arena the goods news is that
the heat sensors were activated. But Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate
-</p>
<p><strong>senor de l’arena</strong>: Mucho gusto, senorita.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: - did feel that she had rather too long to
work on the safe before they triggered the alarm, isn’t that right Miss
Hall?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Oh yes. Absolutely. Much too long I should
yes.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Under the circumstances I think we would
recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load. How do you
feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, Senor de l’Arena, there’s no reason to
disrupt your party any longer. we have some further concerns about the
disposition of your security guards, which you’ll receive in our written
report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow. Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: The necklace?</p>
<p><strong>senor de l’arena</strong>: What are you trying to do,
senorita? Rob me.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I’m missing something here, aside from a
500,000 pound necklace. Even after I botched the job, I could’ve walked
out of there with the bloody thing.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: At least you walked.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: If you weren’t going to let me get away with
it, why did you let me go thru with it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Wanted to see how good you were. I’m hoping
we might work together.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: May I say something, no offence? You look like
a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody
hell do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Working under adverse conditions. Highly
adverse conditions.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Sounds smashing. I’m in. Muchacho, mi carro,
por favor! Now be serious. You couldn’t possibly want me off tonight’s
performance..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You didn’t do that badly.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: You’re apologizing for me? Quite the
gentleman..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Not really. I triggered the alarm..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hey, the Bulgari job last week was flawless.
And I’ve always been partial to pale yellows.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I don’t do laundry, or put up with cheeky
bastards who set me up on their territory so they can poach on mine.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Hola..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hi. Would you mind slowing down?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Where did you get this number? I don’t even
have it!</p>
<p><strong>ethan’ voice</strong>: Would you like it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just
listen..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Listen to what?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I need your help and I thin you can use
mine.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Your help? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch
authority. I can make them go away.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Oh bloody hell. You’re a spy.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I deserved that.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Slow down, slow down.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Oh..oh..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Don’t look down. Just..look at me. That’s
it..that’s it..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What’s you name?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Ethan Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk
to me about?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: …more than I thought..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Awfully short notice..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Care to wait a decent interval?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Who wants to be decent?..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: So what’ve you got against spooks?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: When they’ve got your recruiting technique?
Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Oh. Well..this isn’t exactly by the book.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: They’ve got a book for this?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: They’ve got a book for everything.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: The only other spook I knew was a liar.
Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. He’d lie about
his favorite color. But then I reckon it’s an occupational hazard. All
spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Not revealing information doesn’t necessarily
make someone a liar.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: That’s not the point. In the end what spies
rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: That they’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: So where did I got right?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: You’re not a liar. Or you’re an awfully good
one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t know that they ‘pinched’ it. Don’t
even know that they’re blokes.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Well, then, what I am I doing here? I assume
I’m meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: So do I. Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Ask a question, you get an answer!..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Damn, you’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: That’s because I’m on my back.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Are you gonna be here a while?</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Si, senor.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ll pick’em up on my way out, okay?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Fetival’s a pain in the ass. Honoring
saint by setting’em on fire. Sit down, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sorry I didn’t let you know where I was.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Don’t be. Wouldn’t be on vacation if you
did.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well. You’re sorry and I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Why did you phrase it like that?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: ‘You’re sorry and I’m sorry.’</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You gotta be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: Well, Dmitri! How are you?..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: ..I’m fine..and you?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: I’m fine..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m fine and you’re fine..</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: I’m fine too.. I’m fine and you’re fine
- do you remember, dear fried, how you got Sergei and I to repeat those
lines from Dr. Strangelove and we gave you the name of that silly Soviet
Premier because we didn’t know your name?..In those days, you not only
saved our lives, you saved our sanity. ‘Now, then Dmitri - we have this
little problem’: Every search for a hero must begin with something that
every hero requires; a villain. Therefore, in a search for our hero,
Bellerophon, we created a monster Chimera. I beg you, Dmitri, come to
Sydney and accompany me to Atlanta immediately. However we travel, I
must arrive at me destination, within 20 hours of departure. Forgive
this fanciful explanation, but for now prudence dictates that I
communicate nothing but the gravest urgency. I fear I can entrust this
to no one but you, Dmitri. as we say, ‘I’m sorry and you’re sorry’..</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Let me ask you something. You have any
idea what the hell he’s talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: An idea, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Like?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Like it’s a good idea to pick him up in a
hurry. And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. So let’s get
on with it. He’s still in Sydney?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead. So is his
colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier. We had Nekhorvich on a
flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If he didn’t want to go anywhere without me,
how did you get him on the flight?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: You were there.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: When I couldn’t find you, I had to replace
you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what? Two,
three times?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Twice.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: What did you think of him?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You know we had reservations about each
other. Isn’t it a little late in the day to be asking me that?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Airline record list Captain Harold
Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207. as far as the media and all
governmental agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh died on the
flight, but in fact he missed it. He did, however make the next flight -
in cargo, stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: So there’s one thing we know Ambrose
doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Then you do think it was Ambrose.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted
and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred
innocent passengers?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sean feels he hasn’t done the job unless he
leaves a lot of hats on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: The question is why? What was this Chimera
Nekhorvich was carrying?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Right now only Ambrose knows that.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: In any case, you’ve got to recover Chimera
and bring it to us.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: In order to do that, I’ve got to figure out
how he plans to make money with it.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: - right. In fact since the plane went down
our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock
pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: ‘Terrorists?’</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Well you know Nekhorvich’s history. You’re
the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon
business.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If that’s what you’re thinking Ambrose would
have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got
on the plane. Locating him in time to stop something like that -</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: - is where Miss Hall comes in.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship
which he took very seriously. She walked away and he’s wanting her back
ever since. We believe she’s our surest and quickest way of location
him.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Then makes sure she continues to see him.
Gets him confide in her and report to you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You made it sound as if I was recruiting her
for her skills as a thief.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Well, then I mislead you. Or you made the
wrong assumption. Either way we’re asking her to resume a prior
relationship, not do anything she hasn’t already done.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She’s got no training for this kind of
thing.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She’s
a woman. She’s got all the training she needs.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t think I can get her to do it.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: You mean it’ll be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Well it’s not mission difficult, Hunt.
It’s mission impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.
If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you’re welcome to
try. Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have
any further qualms about getting her to do the job.</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: Senor, senor! Your flowers.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yes. They’re very nice..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What’s the population of Seville any idea?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Five, six-hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: There’s nearly 2 million in London.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: And six billion in the world.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: That’s lot of people out there..how many of
them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sean Ambrose, for one.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall
you staying something like, ‘I was hoping we could work together.’</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: This wasn’t what I had in mind, Nyah.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: But it is what you’d like me to do. so tell me
to do it..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean’s
life.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I’d like a little more conviction..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: So would I. But it’s not mine to give.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: You’ve either got it or you don’t. Let your
conscience be your guide?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: But I don’t have a conscience. I’m a bloody
thief.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You can be a thief and have a conscience.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: No. You can be a thief and have a conscience:
Not me. Why did you have to tell me about this! What do I have to do to
get away from this guy? When you’re with him, he messes about with your
head every waking moment..even now I’ll be at some out-of-
the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the
table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment
where I am in the world but he does. And it looks like he’s done it
again. You know his definition of a true paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Someone in possession of all the facts. Are
you telling me I have to do this?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Generally, I don’t favor coercing someone.
Not when there’s a chance my life could end up in their hands.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: And that’s the only reason?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Can you think of a better one?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Not me. I was just hoping you might..or
that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as
physical.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Look, would it make you feel better if I
didn’t want you to do this?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Much.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Then feel better!..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Sean will never be anything but suspicious if
he picks up some sort of ‘yoo-hoo-I’m- not-nad’ message. Not after the
way we broke up.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What wouldn’t make him suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Probably that I needed him in some urgent
way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn’t possible sort
out myself..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Serious trouble, Nyah, is something I can
always arrange..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: This little chip sends a coded signal that
can be picked up only by our computer.</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: When it’s in your ankle we can track
you within three feet of anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Look, I can’t run your arrest in CNN, but I
guarantee he’s monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for
what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he’s got the
ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: This doesn’t seem to be accomplishing
much.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, I mean it’s not a total loss. It is
keeping a very capable thief off the street..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn’t
want to know. Maybe he’s lost interest.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Your lawyer to see you.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, here we go.</p>
<p><strong>sector</strong>: AUSTRALIA, moving into NEW SOUTH WALES, and
then to: Sydney. Here Ethan pulls up names, photos and profiles of
potential candidates. They scroll past, one face morphing into another.
Ethan punches in on WILLIAM A. BAIRD. EXPERTISE: Qualified in virtually
every mode of transport, land, sea, air.</p>
<p><strong>ordinances</strong>: Small arms and automatic weapons
authority, edged and impact weapons. PROCUREMENT: Resourceful.
EXPLOSIVES: Precision detonation, diffusion.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Stop and look for something in you
purse..kneel down..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Limo’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: - Ambrose will have counter-surveillance
second to no one’s. When and if he contacts you, push this button before
you actually end up under his roof it’ll scramble your transmission to
us.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: When will you be there?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Before you are.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: How can you possibly? I’ve got to get right on
the plane. I’m leaving now.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Oh, I do. But as we know I’m a very poor judge
of character.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He’s got you on Qantas flight 2735. It’s
going to be delayed.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’ll be fine. I’m going to lose you.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Ethan, you take care of yourself, I’ll take
care of myself because if push comes to shove, I’m gonna bail - and
without giving two week notice.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, forewarned is forearmed. And while
we’re at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose’s
plans, especially any involving you..</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: Welcome to Australia, mate.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Thanks - mate.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It’s the transponder.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Put in the coordinates and let’s get a
visual. The visuals aren’t coming up.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: The satellite doesn’t work as fast as I
do.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, I’ve heard about you, Luther, and I
just want to tell you it’s an honor and a pleasure to be working with
you blokes, whoaa! That’s some transponder!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It certainly is. How did we get so
lucky?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is it him, then?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Damn. Just when it was about to get
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s okay. She scrambled the transmission.
Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Can’t we speed this up.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: With what? This is the only computer that’ll
do this.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: - right. Now there’s a bloke who knows how to
deliver a proper welcome. Don’t get me wrong, mate. You were quite
hospitable. Is it him, then?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It is, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Then we got’em!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We don’t know what we’ve got because we don’t
know what he’s got, where he’s got it or what he’s doing in Sydney with
it.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Not much luggage.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I left in a bit of a hurry. I’m terribly
grateful, Sean.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: How grateful?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Well that depends.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: On what.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: How hard you had to work to get me out of
there..how in the world did you ever find me?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: How I usually find you, Nyah.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: How do you that.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Magic…</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Ahh..</p>
<p><strong>wallis</strong>: No flies on her. No bugs either. She’s
clean.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: All cats are.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: …therefore in a search for our hero,
Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What you got there, mate?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: A myth..just a myth…shouldn’t you be checking
out their countersurveillance?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well you know his blokes’ll place the OSCOR
in his annex, where else if you’re pinpointing transmitters, video
signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: ..or hard wired..</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: - or hard wired, right. First line of
perimeter defence’ll run from the back of the dock to the front of the
house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height
of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Ethan, here’s Nekhorvich, and here’s his
boss</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well do you disagree with that?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Not at all. But how about going into town and
confirming your intuitions on site?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh well, if that’s how you feel about it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: ..then Cambridge..Harvard..entrepreneurial
efforts..in efforts..in 1989, acquired Biocyte in hostile takeover..</p>
<p><strong>mccloy’s voice</strong>: We at out state-of-the-art solar
powered Biocyte building recognized that eternal vigilance is the price
of health.. whether it’s funding the teaching center at the Royal Prince
Edward Hospital, removing aerosol products from the marker or braving
the influenza quarantine at Bruny island late last month..at Biocyte
your life..is our life’s work..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: ..Biocyte workers at Bruny Island.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Your room.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: And my room?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Thought you could use a little something to
wear.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: No changing room?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: You’re not interested in seeing how it
looks.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Oh, I am. Later..</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: ..therefore in a search for our hero,
Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Why’s Nekhorvich going on about an old Greek
myth?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA
molecules. In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant
monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued
the ancient world. I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in
Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: That simple, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice/ethan’s voice</strong>: Damn, you’re
beautiful..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Did you say something?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: I said you’re beautiful, Nyah.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Only because..it’s spring..chalk it up - to
spring fever.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Won’t do, love. It’s not spring. It’s
nearly autumn..You’re in Oz. everything’s upside down and backwards
here.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Maybe that’s it, then. Everything’s upside
down and backwards…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Luther..get us everything you can on the
outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of
the victims.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Right. I guess there aren’t many flu
epidemics in the middle of summer.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yeah? I’ve just rolled up a snowball and
tosses it into hell.</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: Now we’ll see what chance it has.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Twenty-four mil..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice</strong>: Thirty-seven million pounds. That’s
a promising bid.</p>
<p>****: and hands it to Stamp.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: We’ll need this at the track. Well then.
Sorted.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Not everything. Why do you think she’s really
here?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: From her point of view or mine?</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Wasn’t exactly gagging for it when she left
you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: One considers her timing, of course -
getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. Suggestive, even
borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Well, you’ve thorough about it, at any
rate.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Tell me, Hugh. You don’t exactly hang on
Nyah’s every word and gesture, do you? Fairly ratty nail, that.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Sean..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You’re not scrutinizing any casual shrug
for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Sean, please..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse
sent in by IMF to spy in us, why should I deny myself the pleasure of a
ride or two? Or don’t you think I can learn more from her than she can
from me?</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: I do!..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Now Hugh, you must realize that some of us
have the burden of sex to deal with..and my dear chap. I may or may not
know why she thinks she’s here, but I’m willing to take the risk,
because Hugh, I am gaging for it..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You won.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I suppose I did.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: What made you pick that nag? She’d never
won a bloody thing.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: ‘Thief in the Night?’</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Say no more. I’m off to grab a drink. Still
favor Bellinis?</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Naturally Vain..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: ‘Naturally Vain.’ In the fourth. Check her
out. She’s due.</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: You can speak as if I’m right by your
side.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: At the mounting enclosure, just off
the tracks at two o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: How’s it going? Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Just like old times?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Just about..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Tell me who you’ve run into at Ambrose’s.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Near as I can tell, there’s at least a
half-dozen other blokes about the place. Maybe more. Hugh Stamp, an old
mate of Sean’s, is the only one I recognize, bit of a creep and then
some..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We know him. He’s over your left shoulder,
looking right at you as you go on..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: - Michael, his driver’s an Aussie, new to me.
Then there’s the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Have you met them?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Annex is strictly off limits to me and they
never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all
but shoves them under the door.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ve no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big
bloke, ginger hair. They’re into something.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ll be damned. It’s McCloy, the Biocyte</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Nekhorvich’s boss?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with
loads of money piled on them – thirty- seven million on the London
Times. What’s that about?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Bids from possible Chimera buyers – to prove
that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest
money –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Looks like Ambrose is showing McCloy how to
use a digital camera..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Whatever McCloy’s looking at, he’s not happy
about.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of
the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left
jacket pocket…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Left jacket pocket?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Confirm. Left jacket pocket.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Left jacket pocket confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nyah, Ambrose is heading back. There’s an
enveloped inside –</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: – his left jacket pocket.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Where do I meet you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah,
are you up to this?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I’ll muddle through.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: See anything you like?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Yeah. Naturally vain – but they’re about to
close the betting table and I haven’t a sou..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Nyah!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Billy, make sure Nyah’s not followed.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No worries, mate.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Would you mind terribly?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I’ve no doubt..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: To win?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: Luther, smallest digital you got.
Ready to transmit. Betting table twelve.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sorry about that, mate, that must’ve really -
aggrhh!..</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Say again?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh…</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Whatever you’re about in future, watch your
step. Never know who you might run into…</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Where’s the loo then?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: - aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: How’d you do? Don’t turn around.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I managed.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You noticed. What’re you going to do? Spank
me?</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Stamp’s out of the loo.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: This is going to take a couple of
minutes..</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: There in twenty, Ethan..</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Stamp’s a little shaky, but headed
your way, mate.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Copy that. Who do you like? In the race?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What race are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’m booted up. Go, Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: He’s heading down the stairs,
now..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I want you out of Ambrose’s place.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: He’s one tier from the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I want you out of there.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Why? What’s happened. What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thirty steps..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nyah, you’ve done more than enough. Even the
best of snake charmers get bit.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Ethan, tell me -</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Twenty, nineteen..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I want you out of Australia! ..I don’t know
how much more plainly I can put it.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: How do you suggest I go about it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He’s touched your heart. You’re overwhelmed.
You need to think it over. You’ll meet him somewhere in a month. If
You’re not out in 48 hours I’m coming in and getting you out. Give me
the ear piece.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Get your bet down?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Just..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Your nag is making a run for it on the
outside! Bloody hell, Nyah!</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You picked another winner!</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Well, that’s good, isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: Dr. Segi Gradski, Nekhorvich’s
colleague and lifelong friend..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Six hours later.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Here’s a victim from the Bruny Island
outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, happy day.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nekhorvich said ‘However we travel, I must
arrive at my destination within 20 hours hours of departure.’</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: To Australia. It’s made so many convicts
feel at home. Here’s hoping it does the same for you..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Sean, there’s something I’ve been meaning to
talk to you about… Isn’t going to be easy for me to say.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Then don’t say it.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I don’t know what to do about you, Sean. I’m
more than a bit muddled. I need time.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Sort it all out.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: And you’re going to have time. There’s been
a change of plans.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: A change of plans?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Yes. We won’t be able to have dinner
tonight. Something’s come up. I hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Oh, no, not at all. Maybe just a bit.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Ulrich will be about. He’ll look after
you.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: I thought you were going to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory
card.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: In the envelope in my pocket. My right..
jacket..pocket..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Chimera attacking human blood..</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich
on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: What manic invents disease like that in the
first place? Why would he do it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.
Get me a twenty on Nyah.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: She must still be on the property.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I told her to get outta there.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: George. George. George.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Bloody room..just..shut your eyes, shut your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: A visit from an old friend.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: What’s happening here? You’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: Fatigued, certainly. But dead is a
little extreme. On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse
and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: It was in the bloody papers, on the
telly..what’s this about Gradski?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: You are infected with Chimera, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: International, please. I’d like to make a
reservation on the next available flight tonight.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Where is next available flight going?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Fine. I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Ulrich?..Ulrich!…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Easy, easy, easy, shhh!</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Oh Ethan!..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: No use, my friend. The medical staff
wants no part of this. Doctors don’t fancy the idea of dying any more
than anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: How could I possibly be infected?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: That’s exactly what Gradski said - 27
hours before he died. With Chimera, the most minute exposure can be
fatal.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: But then you shouldn’t be feeling to
ill. not for another three of four hours anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: You have Bellerophon.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: You took it! All of it! And what if I need
it?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: ‘If?’ My, my, my…the five hundred people
on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with Chimera needed it as
well.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Oh, please! How was I to know they had to be
treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: By asking me.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: You still don’t get it, do you? You want to
make an omelet, you break a few eggs - I needed to know just how bad the
disease was - in the real world, not the lab. And you never know til you
try. You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of
influenza to create a cure for all influenzas. But I saw you creating a
disease so terrible in Chimera that the cure would be priceless.</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: You wanted the disease in order to
peddle the cure.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Well, the thought had occurred to me. I
needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon. For hero to be
appreciated, you need a monster. Now that’s not so difficult to
understand, is it? Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off
every bloody bug in the zoo! Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&amp;D
money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that’s
barely effective against one strain of one bacterium? If I couldn’t
makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there,
you’d help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is. I’ve
confessed. I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money. Lilly’s
making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs. Pfizer doesn’t even
know where to put the money they’re making on Viagra, and let me tell
you that shit didn’t do a thing for me even at twice the recommended
dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of
here, get me treated and let’s go back to work!..</p>
<p><strong>nekhorvich</strong>: You know, I think it’s a little late for
that. Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Ethan, you know what frightens me most when
I’m with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out
of here?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nyah, it’s very important not do anything to
alarm Ambrose..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What? You told me to get out of here. I
thought you were here to collect me. I was so relieved.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No time to explain. You’ve done well, and
we’re so close. So close. It’s critical that you do whatever Ambrose
asks. Don’t worry - it’ll be over soon.. That’s a promise.. Come on, now
off you go!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy’s got
Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There guys are walking around with different
halves of the same dollar bill?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on
the plane, but he didn’t get the Chimera virus.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Yeah. Why else would he come back to
Australia? If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he’s sitting on
a cure without a disease.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You’ve got the voice print, I’ll get us
in..</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: You were right. Hunt stung McCloy tonight. He
knows. They’ll be going into Biocyte…</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Good..then we go where he’ll be, don’t we?
Well done, Hugh. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’re home, guv’ner. Home..</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: - where’s George. My regular driver. Where
is he?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Took ill, guv’. Touch of the flu. They say
it’s going around. Nasty business. Mind you don’t catch a chill now.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Luther, do you have the building up and
running?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their
storage structure..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nyah still on the property?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: She hasn’t left it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Okay, here you go -</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Let’s start from the inside out.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: All storage and production of Chimera is
done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the
building.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Chimera itself is kept in two
places: in production vials in an incubation room and housed in a small
airtight chamber - inside three injection guns.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Mate, you kill it in both places,
we’re laughin’ and we go home.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Now how to get in there.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: No garage entrance. Lobby’s protected by
five guards on rotating patrol.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: If you look at Hunt’s operational history,
he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won’t go
into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with
security.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Not going in from the ground. Show me the
atrium.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: The atrium? One of a kind. Runs down
the center of the building. Provides 24-hour natural light via mirrors
and daylight storage cells. Optimal growing conditions for the virus.
Ends in a glass floor which doubles as part of the lab’s ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Hey, atrium roof closes at sundown.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: And if the louvers are open for more
than thirty seconds at night, the Civil Emergency alarms are tipped.
Those even I can’t stop. Thirty seconds total to get you in and the
cable out.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Security?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Thirty-second opening in the roof and a
250-foot drop.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m not waiting 48 hours. When we’re done at
Biocyte, if she’s not out of Ambrose’s, I’m going in and getting her
out.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: No, Hunt will prefer to engage in some sort
of acrobatic insanity to enter Biocyte somewhere through the atrium
where security is minimal..</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Package away in five..four..three..
two..one…</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’m not ready!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m gone..</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: C’mon! C’mon! C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: ..nineteen..eighteen..seventeen…</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: ..sixteen..fifteen..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Luther, I’m looking at security.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion. Alarm in
cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Gotta get that cable out.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2’s voice</strong>: AY! what’s the matter with you?
Can’t you hear the alarm’s gone off in cosmetics?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Right. Then I guess I’ll have to trot off to
see who’s pinching eyeliner, won’t I. I’ll even check the stairwell on
the way.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Retracting cable.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Three..two..one..</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Cable’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Transponder activated..Reading package and
Cable is clean. He’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice</strong>: He’ll make the attempt at the only
possible time for both of us, 11 P.M. - when the guards rotate and the
buildings air-filtration generators go active, covering the sound of his
break-in..</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Ethan, the generators are about to go
active. We’ll be out of contact for eleven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice</strong>: The frequency of the generators
operate to our advantage - cutting radio communication from his team for
the next eleven minutes..</p>
<p><strong>one of the guards</strong>: What’s this, then?
Reinforcements?</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Not exactly, mate.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Billy. I think we got a problem. Nyah’s on
the wing. Up early. Billy, do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Exactly where is she?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: ..in the building…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Say again. Sounds like you’re saying
‘she’s in the building.’</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I am. She is.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice</strong>: Ethan does it the hard way to avoid
confrontation. Neutralizing security guards is simply too distasteful to
him..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice</strong>: I’ve never found that a
problem…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Right. Well, then. She’s not likely to be
alone. is she?</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: The question Is ‘how many of ’em?’ I
can’t get thru to Ethan. Not ’til the generators go off.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When’s that?</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Not for another eight and a half
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy’s voice</strong>: John C. McCloy..</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It looks like Nyah’s headed toward an
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice</strong>: If Hunt actually manages to squeak
thru the atrium he’s liable to make it to Chimera before we will..</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: She’s in the elevator heading toward
Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: How much longer before you can reach
him?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Five and a half minutes. He’s breached the
hot zone..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose’s voice</strong>: On the other hand we know where
Hunt will be and he doesn’t know we’re coming..</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Alert.
Chimera-working-seed-stock-pH-and- temperature-level-outside-optimal
range.</p>
<p><strong>another computer voice</strong>: Alert.
Chimera-master-seed-stock-pH-and- temperature-level-outside-optimal
range.</p>
<p><strong>first computer voice</strong>: Alert.
Chimera-working-seed-stock-pH-at- unacceptable-level..</p>
<p><strong>third computer voice</strong>: Alert.
Chimera-in-vitro-pH-and- temperature-level-outside-optimal range..</p>
<p><strong>first computer voice</strong>: Alert.
Chimera-working-seed-stock-pH-at- critical-level. Alert. Stock-life
threatened. Alert.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: How’re we doin’, then?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: He should’ve have killed the virus in the
incubation area..Nyah’s exited the elevator on the same level as the
lab.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: What can we do’ mate?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow
dot gets to the red one.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Subject is contaminate free. Zero
contaminate factor. Subject contaminate free.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: He’s still got three injection guns
in the test lab..They’re loaded with doses of Chimera which he’ll
destroy by firing into a hyper-thermal chamber.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: - twenty-seven, twenty-six, twenty-five,
come on, Ethan we’re almost there! I-I’m off sensitive for this..</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Oh - oh - oh -</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Those were two explosions, your van and
your safehouse, in case you didn’t hear them both – I believe that means
you’ve also lost a friend.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: And you couldn’t walk to tell me about
it.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Hold your fire, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Fight a bit of a cold..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: And you’re happy about that?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Beats fighting the flu, I’m here to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You know, that was the hardest part of
having to portray you. Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I would’ve thought the hardest part was
exercising restraint. Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun
off. You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured
out where the virus really was.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: I knew where it was.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Oh. then you knew the only way could smuggle
the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself
and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty
hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.
You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very
thing you came for.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Stop! Put a sock in it! Hit that bloody gun
and you’ll spray the bloody virus all over the place!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: There it is, guys, the last of it.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Yep. You’ve provided us with a golden
opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What was the top bid?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Why, you going to make me a better
offer?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not
really.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Somebody’s been slipping you our mail. Come
on out here, you bad girl.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She doesn’t belong here, Sean. Let her
go.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: She wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you,
Hunt. from this moment you’re responsible for what happens to her, and
if you’re looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to
pick up the gun and bring it to me. Ball’s in your court, Hunt. What’ve
you got to say? Nyah’s waiting for your answer.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Ethan, Nyah’s in the building! Do
you copy?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Oh, Hunt, please! One can’t hold Nyah
responsible for her actions..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: In other words, you’re calling her a
flake.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You know women, mate. Like monkeys, they
are. Won’t let go of one branch til they’ve got a grip on the next…get
it, Nyah. I’ll cover you.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: This isn’t exactly working out the way you
thought it would, Ethan. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You..bitch!</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: You’re not going to shoot, Sean. Not this
bitch. She’s worth thirty-seven million pounds.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What did you think you were doing!</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I wasn’t thinking! Just..trying to keep you
from getting hurt, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: - you who don’t have a conscience.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I guess I lied..You can’t get both of us out
of here, can you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Then you’ll have to kill me before it’s too
late. Before I start killing people.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: I’m infected with Chimera. You know you don’t
have a choice. Just do it now.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We’ve got 19 hours and 57 minutes before you
start killing anybody. I’ll get Bellerophon into your system by then.
Just stay alive. I’m not gonna lose you.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: ‘Dreaming of Birds and Flying Fox,’
‘Bushfire Dreaming,’ ‘Wind Dreaming,’ – oddly appropriate -</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Not yet. We did manage to pull any sensitive
equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: We could lock down passport control and
all ports of authority, but that won’t stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we
don’t know who else we’re looking for – all terrorist bank accounts of
which we’re aware are stable. No deposits, no withdrawals. Therefore no
suspects.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We think we’ve got our finger on the
buyer.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Do you? Even assuming you’re able to
prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you’ve now got an additional problem.
You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte. If Ambrose is going to sell
Chimera now, he’ll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall’s
blood to market.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yes, I believe that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: But that leaves another seven or eight
pints of Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You mean that leaves Miss Hall.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Yes, I believe that’s right. Now my
understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes
infectious. Highly infectious.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: You noted the time of exposure?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: - good. Then if you manage to get hold of
Ambrose, and obtain what he’s got, you’ve got - - 8 hours 57 minutes and
twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera
on earth.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She sacrificed herself..</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Brave girl. If you can get hold of
Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate
sacrifice. But in either case you’ve got less than nine hours to kill
her or cure her. After that it’s out of our hands and a matter of
worldwide material law. And Hunt. However you obtain it, we want you to
preserve a sample of Chimera. Bring it back alive.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Something else?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Aren’t you even curious? About why she did
it?</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: No. I can’t afford to be curious. And
neither can you, Hunt..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Feel like pleading for your life?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Not as much as you feel like hearing it.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: God damn it, Nyah! Why did you do it? Why
did you save that bastard?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: If it’ll make you feel any better I won’t do
it again.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: If it’ll make you feel any better, you’re
going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: In just a few hours you can be assured of
going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz. G’day.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Luther?..Luther.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Ethan, I keep telling you there’s not a
chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there’s not a
chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running! How
much time does she have left?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Before we kill her or cure her..</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Wrong. All we’ve got to worry about is
Ambrose. Nyah will take care of Nyah.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the
next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself. So, first things,
first. Swanbeck said there’s no cash movement from any monitored
terrorist accounts.</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: Confirms what Ambrose is gonna do
-</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: - who he’s doing it with, and where
he’s gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Ethan’s out from under the bridge and
on the south-east face..</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Ethan, Ambrose and his tem have over
the bridge -</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: You all right, mate? From here it
looks like very security. What’s it look like like from there?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Risky.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Breached the structure at the ten o’clock
grating. In the tunnel moving toward the target.</p>
<p><strong>chemist</strong>: It’s a DNA match. The blood’s loaded with
Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Well, then. You’ve got both the virus and
the anti-virus, Chimera and Bellerophen. Which means I’ve thirty million
for you</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Not exactly. Wallis?</p>
<p><strong>wallis</strong>: More like two-two point two million.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: In any case we don’t want your cash.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Then what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Stock, Mr. McCloy. Stock options, to be a
little more precise.. - cut her loose..right in the center of town..the
more crowded the better.. How quickly can you manufacture more of the
antivirus.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Ethan, just picked up an Ambrose
call - Nyah’s been dropped off. I think she’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Somewhere in Sydney.</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Ethan? Do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>ethan’s voice</strong>: ‘Somewhere in Sydney?’ Care to harden
the target?</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Can’t. Until I can get the GPS up on
our computer..it’s still down..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: The clock is ticking..</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Bellerophen? No time at all once I’ve got
it.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Good. Biocyte stock is just a week or two
away from going through the roof.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: An outbreak of Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: In downtown Sydney for a start.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: – now here’s the way it’s going to
work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..</p>
<p><strong>wallis</strong>: Ninety-three point four million.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our
hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options. We’ll borrow your
thirty million to buy those options. Your stock’s never sold above
thirty-one dollars a share. We’ll agree to buy at fifty.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Outrageous. I won’t let you take control of
my company.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Sit down. You’ll be a billionaire. Better
than being broke. I’ve got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies
standing in line. Ball’s in your court, Mr. McCloy.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Run that bastard down.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: We’re running short on time, Mr. McCloy.
We’ve got to conclude our business.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: Yes, start the transfer.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Follow it. Let me know.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You broke our deal.</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: You’re too trusting. Raise your hands
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>stamp’s voice</strong>: Sean, this rat’s reached the end of
the maze.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>stamp’s voice</strong>: More or less.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Bring him to me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’re due to take off.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Not for seven more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>wallis</strong>: Sean. Transfer complete.</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: What exactly do you intend to do with
him?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Ethan? Ethan? Do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, mate, maybe this is one of those times
we shouldn’t follow orders.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: What have you got to say for yourself.
Hunt? Any last words?</p>
<p><strong>stamp</strong>: Afraid he’s got no choice. I believe I broke
his jaw.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Hugh, I’m impressed..</p>
<p><strong>mccloy</strong>: What do you intend to do?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You needn’t watch.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: - right. We don’t have a lot of time, Hunt.
whatever you’ve got to say, say it now.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Man at your six.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: The field of fire is too heavy. Back off and
pinpoint their positions.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Hunt’s heading for the bridge. Coming in at
twelve o’clock high.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Clear that bridge for me.</p>
<p><strong>luther’ voice</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: They’re tracking you on the left,
Ethan. Prepare for some fire.</p>
<p><strong>gps computer</strong>: The target is located.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Ethan, the computer’s up. I’ve got Nyah.
She’s moved out of the city.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Luther, say again.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: She’s on the North Head Bluff - approaching
the cliffs. One klick away.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Copy. She’s only got twenty-eight minutes
left. Track ahead and pick her up.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: We won’t be able to cover you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re breaking up. Track ahead and pick her
up. You’ve got me on GPS. Bring her to me.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Billy, North Head. Haul ass.</p>
<p><strong>wallis</strong>: Get him.</p>
<p><strong>ulrich</strong>: I can’t get a good shot.</p>
<p><strong>wallis</strong>: Shut up. I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Range is two kay.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I hope there’s a place to land.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There she is. I got visual.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: We’re down to seven minutes 23 seconds..</p>
<p><strong>luther’s voice</strong>: Ethan, we’ve got her. Tracking to
you now. We’re reading 5 minutes 19 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Bearing two one zero. About 3 klicks. Ethan,
we’re moments away..</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Go ahead. Use it Hunt. It’s not a bad way
to go. A lot better than the way that bitch is going to die.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Hunt. You should have killed me.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Sorry, Ethan. I don’t quite know where to
begin. Any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’d like me to conduct my own
debriefing.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Why not? You’ve done just about everything
else on this operation.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’d thank you – but I’m not sure that was a
compliment.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Of course it was. Anyone whose operations
requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a
little flak here and there. You try flogging the stories on CNN I’ve had
to come up with about what’s been going on around here the last few
days. At any rate, it’s been most instructive – what they’ll swallow, or
what they’ll broadcast with a straight face. Miss Hall’s blood, it
appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus. Not even
antibodies.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yes, I gathered as much.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: And the only other remaining sample was in
the canister you recover from Ambrose.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: And that appears to have been destroyed.
It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only
really effective against Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: But you were under specific instructions
to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus. I’d be very
interested to know how, after you’d managed its recovery intact, it
subsequently got destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: By fire. That’s the best way, really.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: So you didn’t fail mission, you simply
changed it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No, I don’t. But in this case -</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: In this case, it wasn’t a bad idea. In
face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don’t make a habit of it.
And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will
certainly be expunged. I’m assuming you approve.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Where is she now, by the way? Do you
know?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t. No exactly.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Well, Hunt, what are your plans?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I’ll let you
know where I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>swanbeck</strong>: Oh, you don’t have to do that. Wouldn’t be
a vacation if you did.</p>
<p><strong>sky newscaster</strong>: This incident in the wake of rumors
suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and Biocyte’s financial difficulties
– including criminal allegations of insider trading, embezzlement,
conspiracy to commit fraud, and stock parking – have, understandably,
sent stock prices of the pharmaceutical company plummeting.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: So what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Good job. And thanks.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s it? That’s it? That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: And the check’s in the mall.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Right. Just remember, mates. Billy Baird’s
the name. Anything you need to get, move or watch, I’m your man.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Always nice hearing from you man. Stay in
touch..</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Do you know me?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No. Should I?</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: No. You just looked as if you did.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>nyah</strong>: Oh. Well..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Let’s get lost.</p>
