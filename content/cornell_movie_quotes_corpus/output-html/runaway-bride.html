<h1 id="runaway-bride">runaway-bride</h1>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Hey, Fisher, pick up. I have some column ideas
I want to bounce off you. Not there? Okay. Listen I’m thinking of
writing about those mind-numbing informercials that are always on.</p>
<p><strong>construction worker</strong>: Your column should be so
funny.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Okay, I was also thinking I might write
about…</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t know any people like
that.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Fisher? Come on – I know you’re sitting there
laughing at me. Pick up. I want to run an idea past you.</p>
<p><strong>t-shirt vendor</strong>: Hey, Ike, when are you going to put
me in an article?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: When your t-shirts stop shrinking.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I see photos of a lot of dead writers on these
walls. Got any living ones? I have a story to tell that could win one of
them a Pulitzer. Picture this, if you will. A small town in Maryland, a
sleepy little village, within that a hardware store…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: So what’s in store for us in tomorrow’s
column?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t know yet. I’m kind of a last- minute
man. Ideas don’t flow until an hour or two before deadline.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: This is very interesting. You get your ideas
for your column from life. You start up a conversation with a woman in a
bar, attack her choice of reading material, try and get a rise out of
her while you contemplate whether or not she’s worth hitting on.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No, I can’t hit on you until I get an idea.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s flattering.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No, you don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I think I do understand. So my not responding
to your baiting me will inspire one of those potential bitter diatribes
you love to write about women and all the things we do to drive men
crazy?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t write bitter diatribes about women…
very often.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Only when the ideas aren’t flowing, huh?
Well, it was very nice to meet you, one-minute man.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: That’s last minute man. And it’s the quality
that counts.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You know, for a good looking man, you
strike out a lot.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ve seen much worse.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The brush-off.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Not as private as I thought.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Writing or wiping?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Give me a pen.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Ah, come on. They deserve it. They love you,
they hate you, they’re hot, they’re cold, they’re high, they’re low…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: … They’re up, they’re down. It’s really fun
making this list with you, but I’ve got a column to go write.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Ike.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But you don’t have a really superb idea! Well,
there’s a girl from my hometown you could write about.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Excuse me, we don’t need any new
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She likes to dump grooms right at the altar.
They call her “The Runaway Bride”.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She performed the travesty seven or eight
times. Right at the altar she turns around and runs like hell.
Bolts.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I give up.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She has the next victim all lined up. She’s
twirling another body on the spit.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Imagine if you will, a small town in
Maryland…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: “Today is a day of profound introspection, I
have been accused of using this column to direct bitter diatribes at the
opposite sex! This uncomfortable accusation has plunged me into at least
fifteen minutes of serious reflection, from which I have emerged with
the conclusion that, yes – I traffic in female stereotypes.”</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: “But how can one blame me when every time I
step out my front door I meet fresh proof that the female archetypes are
alive and well? Te mother, the virgin, the whore, the crone; they’re
elbowing you in the subway, stealing your cabs, and overwhelming you
with perfume in elevators.”</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: “But perhaps, in fairness to the fairer sex,
I do need to broaden my horizon and add some new goddesses to the
pantheon: I would like to nominate for deity…”</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: “… The cheerleader, the coed, and the
man-eater, the last of which concerns me most today.”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: “To be fair, the man-eater isn’t exactly new.
In Ancient Greece, this fearsome female was known as Erinys, the
devouring death goddess. In India, she is Kali, who likes to devour her
boyfriend Shiva’s entrails while her yoni devour his – dot dot dot,
never mind. In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed man-eater is called
Ragma…”</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You noticed these are all countries
without cable. “… And in Hale, Maryland where she helps run the family
hardware store. She is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter …” “…. AKA, the
Runaway Bride.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Holy moly.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: “What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that
she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them. She has
already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar.”… I
can’t ready anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: “And her ritual feast continues as
she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance. So all bets
are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn’t honeymooning with Las
Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there
before the race… before the rice hits the ground” Holy moly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: You tell Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No, you tell her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: No, no. You’re her best friend.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: You know, it’s just possible that she
hasn’t read this yet.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Maybe she hasn’t read the paper…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Here we go! One antique hot water handle
with the “HOT” still on it, guaranteed to fit any American Standard cast
iron tub with a four-inch center made between 1924 and 1938. In other
words, I think you’re out of the doghouse with Mrs. Paxton.</p>
<p><strong>mr. paxton</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Alright, Mr. Paxton, I’ll put it on your
account.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You don’t need an air conditioner, Earl, you
just need an attic fan – There’s more in the back.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: So – Mag – you’ve seen this, huh?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes, I’ve seen it. And I have to say it’s
the rudest and most offensive… joke anybody’s ever played on me!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette
jokes, so we didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Holy moly.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Um, you know, now would be a good moment to
tell me this is fake. It won’t be funny if you drag it out. Okay? Okay,
well… I mean, I can find out… Real newspapers smear. Phoney papers
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Bag.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: “Dear Editor…”</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’ll put in a good word for you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, no, don’t mention my name in there.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You can go in now.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: “Anyway, I’m just dropping you big city folk
this little note to say that I have thought of a ritual sacrifice that
would satisfy my current appetite: Ike Graham’s column on a platter.
Yours truly, Maggie Carpenter. P.S. – I have inclosed a list of the
gross factual misrepresentations in your article. There are
fifteen.”</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Fully. I like her. She has wit.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I left four messages. You don’t return my
calls.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: So? I never returned your calls, even when we
were married. And what’s Fisher doing here anyway?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral
support.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Since when does Ellie need moral supp–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – It’s for you, Ike.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Journalism lesson number one. If you
fabricate your facts, you get fired.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Lesson number two. Never work for your former
spouse.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s not nothing to do with it. You cooked
this story up and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I didn’t cook up a story. I had a source.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Someone reliable, I’m sure. A booze- hound in
a bar?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: In vino veritas.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Don’t knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in
bars are good. It means they’re not driving.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No, that’s what makes you unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I merely write the stuff. You’re the one that
serves it up.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Not anymore. I have to draw the line. She
sent us this list. Our lawyers say it’s actionable.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Lawyers. I don’t know, Ellie – Firing me is
going to be very tough on you. It’s going to be hard to get over. There
will be therapy bills for you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I already made an appointment for later
today.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: See? You want custody of my job? … Why not just
consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I’ve served my
time?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry, Ike. This is permanent.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: She canned him, she canned him…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Come here, Mag, and try this on.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Listen: “Dear Ms. Carpenter, I apologize to
you for this unfortunate matter. Ike Graham’s column will no longer be
appearing in this paper. Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That-a-girl! You sacked him. This is the weight
of the pack you’re going to have to carry in the Himalayas. Tell me if
it’s too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece,
and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I’m in a different position
now…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: What are you trying to say to me, Fish?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Vindication. How would you like to get some?
A chance to prove that, though your facts weren’t entirely straight,
your theory was correct.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: The real story on Miss Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: All the gory details.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: The anatomy of the black widow spider of
Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: It wouldn’t be a bad way to get you back
into writing feature pieces again.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: This is good. It is a good story, Fish.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: If she runs, then it’s a cover story. All
true. All accurate.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I
can do this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Then you’ve got it. If you leave tomorrow
for the hinterlands, you’ll have plenty of time before her next wedding
trot.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: “Paid vindication” That’s what I call
justice.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Justice, yes. Paid, I don’t know. They like
the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: But I’ll get my normal fee, right?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You want me to do it on spec?!</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Don’t say “spec” like it’s a dirty word.
Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book
advance…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Oh yeah! I happen to know from reliable sources
that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I think I’m in Maryberry.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Cindy, you better 86 Sprout. He seems to be
enjoying the petroleum distillates.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That’s it. Back to obedience school.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Okay – have a seat… gently, carefully.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: You’re a goddess!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I didn’t even need to change this gasket,
just put in a little hydraulic fluid.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Stop it. When you talk like that, I get
turned on and it frightens me.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Hello. I’m looking for Maggie Carpenter. There
was a sign at the hardware store across the street…</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Are you a reporter?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: It’s been our experience that anyone with
some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city
reporter wanting to interview Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: About her upcoming wedding and all.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No, about her getting that asshole from New
York fired.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I am just such a reporter. And you are?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: And who are these lovely ladies?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Cindy. Maggie’s unmarried cousin.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Mrs. Pressman. No relation.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Looking for Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Yep. Maggie – Someone to see you.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Reporter?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Yup!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I hope you have a different angle. It’s
pretty much all been covered.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Originality is my speciality.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Hold on – Nobody interviews Maggie in here
unless they’re getting haircut.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: She’s the boss.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Sorry, no. I just got one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact
for you.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Pressman.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: It’s her fourth time to the altar,
you know. Not seven like they said.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I know. Tell me something. Do you think she’s
going to make it all the way this time?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: She swallowed her gun.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: I’m not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the
newsstand, he’s our local bookie, you know, he’s giving eight to one
odds she won’t. He says she’s so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds
on her. I’m going to wait to hear what the pros say.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Good fact. Well, you let me know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Oh, I will.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Well, instead of a haircut, how about a
wash? You know, get all that city grit out of it.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You’ll answer my questions?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Have a seat. Peggy, why don’t you give him
the special treatment that strengthens the follicles.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Getting nervous?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Nervous? Not at all! No. I’ve never been
more certain in my life. Except – I am having all kinds of weird
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Weird dreams? You’re going to tell me about
them?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Let’s just put this back here for the
aromatherapy.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: In another one…</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Hey, Pete, I’ll be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m inside the church. Everyone I know is
there, only they’re not really them. They’re like Frankenstein monsters,
but without the bolts coming out of their necks. It’s all very “Night of
the Living Dead”. And here’s the creepiest part – I look down at my
dress and it’s red. I mean, I have no idea what it means. Red’s not my
color!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I think you’d look good in red.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No, she’s talking about your hair.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re all ready for football season,
Mr. Graham.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Yes, I think I nailed the personality profile
of the women of Hale.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Doc’s Pharmacy. Third and Elm. Tell him Pete
sent you. Want my hat?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He seems crabby.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: If you’re looking for Elm Street, it’s that
way.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: If you came down here in the pursuit of
happiness, you might as well go back. Because you can’t make me feel
bad.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’m not here to make you feel bad. I’m here for
vindication. In my heart…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You have one?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I feel I’m right about you. You got me fired,
lady. You destroyed my reputation and you screwed up my hair. You chew
men up, spit them out and loved it. And I’m down here to satisfy myself
on that point.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Did something happen to make you care about
reality?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I’m onto the
truth. You’re going to do the same thing to “poor bastard number four”
that you did to the last three. You’re going to run again. And I’m not
leaving until you do.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re going to be very disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve got to
get back to work. I still have my job.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham. Talk to
whoever you want. You might actually stumble upon a fact or two.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Hey, kid, I’ll give you ten bucks for your
hat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know, when I only see one dog, I know
I’ve had too much to drink.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’ll never guess who came crawling into
town with his tail between his legs.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: In other words – he’s only human. An he
brought us a bottle of wine.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: They made me put my hat back on.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, yeah. Scared the hell out of
Skipper.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, no, you should have seen Skipper. It wasn’t
that funny.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: So, the forces of good and evil have already
met.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll help you take into the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Check on the crabs, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Gee, I hope they don’t have a fight out there.
You don’t think they’ll call it off…?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, wedding cake freezes. This we
know.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You know, your daughter seems…</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: That’s okay, Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Like her mother.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Ah, beautiful. I just can’t see her leaving
multiple grooms in the dust like that.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Oh, yes, you can. She’s has ’em all
on tape.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: She has a tape?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. Lee at the hotel videos wedding. I
mean Maggie didn’t know she was going to make the hundred-yard dash.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Dad’s fishing trip, Grandma’s knee operation,
Grandma’s birthday…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My
daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels. Maggie
may not be Hale’s longest running joke, but she certainly is the
fastest.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A tape. It reads: “Maggie I, II, III.”
Ike’s interest is more than piqued. Ike picks it up. They get up and go
to the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: This is good, Dad, don’t leave anything
out.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So I’ve come to see it as a bonus, really,
that we’ve been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Not this one. This one’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: That’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Despite what you think, I don’t do it on
purpose. And I have no intention of doing it again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s right, Maggie. Just keep your eye on the
ball.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Ahh.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m the town’s unofficial fitness trainer. Big
advocate of the mind and body combining for success. You could say or
you can quote me, I’m a glass half full king of guy.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Bob’s the head of the P.E. department at the
high school. And he coaches the football team. And he’s climbed
Everest.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Everest. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Twice…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Without oxygen…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My girl likes to brag about me.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: How romantic.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: We think so.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two
Sherpas and a yak.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You won’t believe what I’m looking at, Fisher.
A videotape of all three train wrecks.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Kamikaze!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: This one’s very popular, but oh, you’ve
used this one before… Brian. But I like the white dinner jacket.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, he’s no good. Too blond.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: We’ll go with total traditional.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Too dark.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: But he’s got the Bobster’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: Sure. Here, Maggie. I think this makes
the best you.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Let’s see… Excuse me, isn’t that cute? Ahh…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: You must be that Mr. Graham fellow.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Yes, I am. And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: Betty Trout. Five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Oh, Betty. I take it you’re going to be making
the wedding cake and they say you’re throwing –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: – The luau for Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Grandma made me the cutest outfit. I can’t
wait to show it to you.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: A pre-wedding luau?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: Yes. My husband and I love luaus. It’ll
be fun.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Fun? Fun isn’t the word.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: If you’re still in town, you should stop
by.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, I’m sure he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Actually, I would love to come. Thank you.
Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Is that what you’re going to do now? Follow
me around everywhere I go?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: Your two cinnamon rolls.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Bye, Betty. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He’s not a nice person.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Maggie, don’t marry Coach! Marry me. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re jail bait, Dennis. Go away. Run your
laps. Go. Go.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Drive! Drive! From your hips, get low, get low,
get low. Next!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What is he up to now?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ike just came by to check out the team.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: And talk about you.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Bob – are you making friends with this
man?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m just bragging about how great you are. I’m
the luckiest man alive.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well – I’ve got to get moving – lot of work to
do today! I’ll see you two love-birds later.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: See you at the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You bet ya, Coach.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don’t
you realize he’s writing another article about me?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good
offense, right? You’re not going to let your opponent throw you off your
game.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You don’t understand this guy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let him come to the wedding. You’re not
running, right? Say it. “I’m not…”</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m not running.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So if you’re not running and Ike Graham is
there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy
ending, right? All we’re doing is turning lemon into lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’ve got news for you. No amount of sugar
and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take
on a picnic.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where’s that homemade sunshine?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. My last
confession was… ahh…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Of an impure nature?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No – like – I’m having a problem with that
whole turn-the-other-cheek concept. I want revenge. I want to destroy
this guy’s life, career, everything. On the sin scale, how big is that?
I mean, can I “Hail Mary” my way out of it?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Child, any sin in one’s heart is…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: The name’s Maggie. It wasn’t this side of
ten years ago that you had your tongue down my throat. So don’t call me
“child”, Brian. It annoys me.</p>
<p><strong>priest/ brian</strong>: Now don’t get upset.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Brian, open up. Don’t ignore me.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re not even Catholic, Maggie – you really
shouldn’t come to confession.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m just so stressed out about
that slime-ball reporter being in town. I jus had to come warn you he
might show up here and start asking you all kinds of ridiculous
questions.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous
question. The rest weren’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we
dated before you were a priest?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yes, yes, I’m sure I only did you good,
Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What did he ask?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Father, am I too late?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: It won’t take long. Jus two
venials.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Only respectful things. What did we have in
common back then… What kind of music did you like… Did you ruin my life
when you left me standing at the altar…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: And what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: How could I be angry at you when clearly what
has happened to me is as God intended?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Good one! Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: It happens to be how I feel.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: God… Of course. I’m sorry – I mean, I’m…
Brian – I’ve got to go. The man’s a lunatic, but I know exactly where
he’s going next.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: God bless you, Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Oh, wait, my purse.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: He wanted to know how you used to like your
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Weird. Like after all those years you would
remem–</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: – Scrambled, with salt, pepper and dill. Same
as me.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m happy here, where I’m supposed to be. But
if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Could your confess to Father Patrick from now
on?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Gill? Lydia? Gill?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Hey – I found it!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Found what?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Mags! Hey, look – The tape from the Radio City
Music Hall concert – Remember that night I as trying to get Jerry to let
me sit in on “Ripple”?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Listen, Gill – There’s this reporter who’s
ben making my life a living hell … If he comes by here, don’t talk to
him. And whatever yo do…. … Don’t show him that picture of me at the
concert in San Francisco –</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: We went to San Francisco twice. Remember one
time we had a flat tire… Which picture?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Imagine! Maggie Carpenter topless in a public
arena. And I see there was a chill in the air.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Give me that!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: But the most interesting thing here is that I
don’t see the rose tattoo that I’ve heard about on your back.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Ike bet me fifty bucks you don’t still have
it, Mags. I said “You’re on, man! Maggie loved that thing!” And I could
really use fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m not gonna show you guys anything. I am a
soon-to-be-married woman. Now give me that photograph.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Sure, I would love to give this to you. Just
give us one quick gander at that rose, and, I’ll gladly hand it
over.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Fine. Here.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Completely.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Maggie? You got it removed?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Gill, I’ll go ya double or nothing if was a
stick-on.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Maggie?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m really, really afraid of needles… It
doesn’t make me a bad person.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Look, look, man. I think the man is
heartbroken.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He is not!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: I think I am.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Jerry. He’d play. He’d play… Jerry would play
his heart out.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Okay, he’s on base. Can we talk about my
life now? – Ike’s going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal – that
I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He’s totally out to get
me.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: For what reason? Some personal
satisfaction?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That’s what he says, but if he thinks that I
don’t realize he’s writing another article, then he’s an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: It’s probably because you got him fired.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Ya think?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Not that he doesn’t deserve to get fired…
Look! Cory’s going for second!… Sneaky!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Over there. Ten o’clock. He’s talking to our
little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those “sources say”
things.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: He looks better with that stuff out of his
hair. He’s an attractive man.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’d say you’ve been in the sun too long. You
handle him, okay? I could use five minutes off from that creep.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Okay, that’s fine. I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Hello, Peggy Phleming, “not the
ice-skater”.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: That’s Maggie’s seat…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: … And this is Maggie’s beer.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Have you listened to his morning show, “Wake
up with ballplayer”?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he’s
a pretty good ballplayer.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: This game is pretty important to him. He made
all-stars in high school, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: That must have made you proud.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: He was going with Maggie back then. He was
never one of her… I mean, they were never going to get… They just dated
for a while.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: It’s nice that they’re still friends.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Oh, sure. That was a long time ago. See,
she’s not a man-hater at all. She’s very supportive of men…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’ve been here for three minutes. What did
you do to her?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You can turn that finger around.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You misinterpret everything. We’ve all been
friends our whole lives. But that’s the types of relationship you
wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Obviously, I’m not the only one who doesn’t
understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake… Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: See, I cheer good. What is he, a cheer
critic?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: This guy never stops.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Lee, hey, wake up. Give me the key to the
reporter’s room. I want to snoop around.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Okay. Second floor.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Don’t take anything big.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: “How does she get all these guys to propose?
She’s not that beautiful.” Bite me, paper boy.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: All right, I know you’re in there… You steal my
research… You’re messing with the first amendment now. Open up. Open up.
You got no place to go.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I want to have a very serious discussion with
you as to why you’re such a pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You do that. And remind him he’s bringing
the wine to the luau. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A CASSETTE PLAYER. We see the familiar
handwritten label: “Miles Davis.” “Kind of Blue” plays as Maggie listens
in a chair, looking shell-shocked, surrounded by the post-its she stole
from Ike’s room. We see as she reads them: “Father, two- fisted
drinker,” “Peggy, best friend, but Peggy doesn’t totally trust Maggie,”
“Bob” – doesn’t love him. Overwhelmed, she finishes reading the last
note, leans back, puts her feet up on the table, deep in the mood of the
melancholy music.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Do you think I flirt with Cory?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Good morning to you, too. You look good.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Thank you. Do you think I flirt with
Cory?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I don’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: I know. I think sometimes you just sort of
spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on
anything male that moves.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: On anything male that moves? As opposed to
anything male that doesn’t move?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Like certain kinds of coral.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m going to kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Because you think I’m all like… “Hey man,
check me out”.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No, I don’t think you’re like, “I’m charming
and mysterious in a way that even I don’t understand and something about
me is crying out for protection from a big man like you”. Very hard to
compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our
mystery.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: But you haven’t lost your mystery! You’re
very mysterious!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No. I’m weird. Weird and mysterious are two
different things.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: But I’m weird.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No. You’re quirky. Quirky and weird are two
different things.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Peggy, there’s distinct possibility that I
might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love
you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg
your forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: I’m not worried about you and Cory or Cory
and me or even that you’re irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you’ve
been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of
it and that it hurts people’s feelings, maybe it’s time to move on with
your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he’s the
one.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I think you’re right. Is there anything I
can do to make it up to you?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Something that brings warmth to my heart.
Duckbill platypus.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s only funny at Camp Birchwood at three
in the morning at a tick hunt. It’s not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: You’re right. It’s not funny now. Maybe we
both grew up.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Thanks. Will you fix my hair?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Freeze. Hold on to those covers – I didn’t
come here to see Ike Junior.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I take it the desk clerk is one of your many
admirers.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: How do I do it? I’m not that beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Coffee. Now.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re welcome. Your notes made interesting
bedtime reading – if you like trashy fiction. Your observations are
distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’m not a boastful man. What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: My point is that one again, you’re getting
it all wrong. That won’t improve your reputation any, and it’s not very
flattering to me either. So, I’m going to give you a chance to write the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’ve decided to cooperate and let you
interview me. For a thousand bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: My magazine doesn’t pay because for stories.
It’s not what you call ethical.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Oh, but making up the facts as you go along
is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or
expenses or both. I’ll take your check. No credit cards.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You’ve seen the post-its. I’ve already got more
juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Because I think you’re writing on spec and
with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Too much.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Seven-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Six-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Pardon the mess. I haven’t cleaned since the
fifth grade.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s a birthday present for my cousin. Put
your finger in.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Cindy the manicurist.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, the other one.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: This is wonderful. You reconfigure all these
industrial parts and you do something amazing with it.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I like it. This whole thing is pretty
incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New
York.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Maybe someday.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You afraid to try?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, I’m not afraid. Just… Maybe someday.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well, I’m impressed. Absolutely incredible. I
didn’t expect pink and lacy, but this isn’t exactly a woman’s room.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What an incredible chauvinistic
observation.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That’s Brian’s. He took me ut canoeing on
the lake and gave me the ring in a velvet box.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Always a mood killer.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Still sweet.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: It’s a little “Silence of the Lambs” for me. I
can’t believe you waited for the wedding to run.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He’s an entomologist! I thought it was very
unique.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Wait. Don’t tell me. The scoreboard lit up with
“Mary me, Maggie.”</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It was one of the most wonderful moments of
my life. Cal Ripken even applauded.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Highly suspect.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What do you mean? It was incredibly
romantic!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Maybe it’s just me, but – if you got to dress
it up, it doesn’t ring true.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’m a work in progress.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: So? Is that what you said to her?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No. I think I said something eloquent like,
“So, uh – maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?”</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Now that’s romantic. A proposal like that
and you didn’t find eternal bliss? What went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever
thought of that?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Call me crazy, but I believe that check I gave
you entitles me to ask the questions for a while.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Fair enough. Actually…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Even with everything that’s happened I’ve
still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: She’ll be the prettiest little flower girl in
your daughter’s wedding.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Mr. Whittenmeyer. Hi, Polly!</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Hi, Maggie. You’ll have to excuse her,
Maggie. Some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that
little boy up the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I didn’t drag. He tripped on his
shoelaces.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: You’ve come for your dress. Good!
I’ll get it from the back.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Actually, I would like to get this
dress.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: Polly, take Leslie into change.
But the one you have on hold is lovely.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes. But I’ve changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: It’s one thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I have one thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: The other one is only three
hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Is this dress for sale?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: It just seems like an awful lot
of money to spend on one of your dresses, Maggie… You only wear them for
about ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yeah, that’s a good point. The other dress
is nice.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Mrs. Whittenmeyer. May I talk to you for a
second?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: Yes. I’ve been here for thirty
years.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Perfect. Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy
one. But not just any one. She wants that one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: It’s a thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: Will he really do that?</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: It’s a thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whittenmeyer</strong>: Shhhh! The man has ink!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Tough to spend money in this town.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You look… uh… You look fine.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Fine. The newspaper’s upside down. That’s
better than fine.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Bob will be very happy.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Bob! I almost forgot! I have to meet
Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mrs. Pressman, I think we’re ready to
order.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: We’re out the special because
somebody… … didn’t order enough sausage.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let me have the garden omelette. Egg whites
only.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’ll have the same.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What was that? I can’t order my eggs without
sarcasm?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Neutral corners you two. You’re on the same
team now. Any more fighting and it’s fifteen minutes in the penalty box.
Maggie’s the nicest person you’ll ever meet. But she’s always focusing
out there. She’s got to start focusing more in here. That’s why she’s
had some – whatever you want to call it – problems in the past. That’s
what we’re working on – focus. Right, Maggie? Focus on Maggie. Focus on
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.
All the sports shrinks use this head stuff. Visualize the end zone, if
you catch my drift.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you
spike the bouquet?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You know, there’s no…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well, I’m off. A reporter’s work is never done.
Mrs. Pressman, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: Tootaloo.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: I’d like to explain about the
weddings. There are reasons why they didn’t come off. Three weddings, no
“I do’s”. You can’t believe how much cake we were left with. I should
weigh three hundred pounds. I don’t think her father minded spending so
much money on booze that nobody drank.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Ike… Hi, Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Gram here was going to give me the skinny on
why you run from marital bliss.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Right, cover your ears, Netta. It’s
not that she’s afraid of the wedding, she’s afraid of the wedding night.
Innocent girls are terrified of “the one-eyed snake”. Why, when I was a
virgin bride, I took a knitting needle with me into the bed…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one- eyed
snake awhile ago.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Oh, yeah, I forgot. I’ll tell you one
thing, your grandpa didn’t forget that wedding night. You can take your
hands off your ears, Netta. Your tea’s getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Can you excuse us a minute? May I have a
word with you, please?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Bye, Netta… Bye, Grandam.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I found this and didn’t know if it was
something interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Oh, my God – It’s Miles Davis. This is “King of
Blue”! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition.
Where did you find this?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It was in the attic. It was jus sitting
there gathering dust.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: It’s valuable. Hang onto it.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No. You take it.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Hmmm… Figuring out what kind of music I like
and then finding me a rare album. You’re not trying to soften me up, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No – I’m cleaning an attic. I wouldn’t
attempt the impossible.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: MAGGIE’S CAR parked a few cars down. He
pulls over and parks. He gets out and speaks into his tape recorder.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: C’mon. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I haven’t had any fun since you got your
driver’s license…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m not exactly having fun, either…
Steady.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good boy, Port Hole.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: His name is Skipper, Dad… Steady.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I changed it. See you later, Mr. Travis.
That guy has a problem… Maggie, you can run everyone’s life but your
own.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No. Forget about it. Don’t even think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Watch your leg, Dad. I’m so tired of
this.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Why don’t you let him sleep it off in the
trunk. I’ll take you for a ride. Then we’ll come back for him. Keep an
eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>drunk man</strong>: I’m too loaded.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I was talking to the dog. All right?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Okay… I’ll just grab my jacket.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: My dad managed a business and two mistresses.
He wanted me to be a novelist. More?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Your filter’s clogged. This takes
unleaded.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Can you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: First I have to find some tools. I need a
half and a nine-six-tenth.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Wrenches. My dad’s gonna love that one.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Kind of isolated.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yeah. It’s kind of nice.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: There’s one thing we New Yorkers know how to do
is hail a cab. If there’s no cab, we walk.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I can get some tools over there…. and save
the battery… There’s one thing we country girls know how to do is cut
across a field. It’s quicker.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Snakes? Are you serious? I don’t like snakes.
I’ve never even seen a snake.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Do you think there’s only one right person
for everybody?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No. But I think attraction is too often
mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it’s
mutual, it’s well, terribly distracting.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes it is. And it doesn’t mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Ike. His conflicted feelings are apparent.
With difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove
their hands.</p>
<p><strong>maggie and ike</strong>: “Tools”.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Yeah, we need a half and nine- sixteenths.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Gonna bust out of another wedding?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You’re sure well known around here.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Yes, well, my theory was that she may be
running because she gets attention… Negative attention is attention.
Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that’s
negative attention.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: This is about her negative attention, not mine.
Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: No, I’m paying for the dress. Do you think
she’s still gonna run?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Look – I’ll be in there later today. I’ll come
by and tell you all about it.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: You’re coming here?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Then come for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Okay, we’ll order out.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Order out like a Philistine, when you got
the Galloping Gourmet here?…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Get this man a Kamikaze.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter,
very professional job.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You could have told me you were fiance number
three.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And end up in the papers? I’ve been
humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I’m sorry she
got you canned.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s a cacophony of contradictions.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well, I’m writing another article on the
cacophony.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ah, can’t stay away from her, can you? Like
a moth to a flame.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Guess you’d know about that. You’re an
entomologist, right? How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not bad. I was traveling around studying the
reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Neuter a locust, feed the world.</p>
<p><strong>gorge</strong>: Not the world. Just Africa and China.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Same as you said. What did you call her? A
“man-eater”, “a devouring death goddess.”</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t think that’s why she ran.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why do YOU think she ran?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t know. I’m working on it. I was on the
wrong track.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And you defending her?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No. I call it like I see it. I’m a journalist.
I’m a truth teller.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Unbelievable, she got to you.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Oh, please!</p>
<p><strong>gorge</strong>: Join the club. Here, you need this more than
me.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: his tape recorder</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Poached, just like me.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese
takeout. That’s New York living.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is
the story coming? Is she a man-eater?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Or a vegetarian?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Or does she pick “NGB’S” – “Nice Guys, But…”
Nice guys, but I’m cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom… Nice
guys, but he just out of prison.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No… They’re interesting guys. Each one of these
guys has something going for him. I mean, one’s been up Everest.
Another’s become a priest. One’s a pretty good guitar player. And this
guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that…</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Fisher, let him talk.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: But one of those guys – not one of them – knew
her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but
they didn’t see her. And she never showed up so they couldn’t see her.
It’s a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they
wanted to be.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Ike is turning sensitive and I can’t bear to
watch. I’m going to make a fresh pot of tea.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yeah… Oh, Jay… Okay… Bye. Fisher, don’t
forget the fortune cookies.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Is that what I did to you? Is that what
happened? Did I just not see you?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No. No, you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well – I’m sorry, I’m really sorry, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry, too. Wow. That only took us
between years to say.</p>
<p><strong>lou trout</strong>: Welcome to our annual country luau. As
you know, Betty and I got married on the rim of the crater, Diamond
Head.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: This year, we’re dedicating our first
dance to the soon-to-be newlyweds, the King and Queen of Hawaii, Maggie
and Bob.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: Pictures of the King and Queen.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Lighten up, wahine.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Lighten up, what?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind
off the reporter.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I haven’t seen him in twenty-four hours. It
just gives me the creeps a little bit. I’d feel better if I knew where
he was.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Would it?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Ike just entering the party. At least he
tried. He’s got a tropical sheet wrapped around his pants and shirt. He
walks to the bar and is greeted warmly by Lee. Maggie gets very
flustered.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m going to go dance with Bob. Because he’s
the man. I like those grapes.</p>
<p><strong>lou trout</strong>: Hey, Mr. Graham, welcome to our luau.
What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You got something without a toy in it?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Aloha. That’s a very fetching headdress you’re
wearing.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Where did you disappear to?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Missed me bad, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: Attention. Listen to Walter. Listen
close, he slurs. Shut up, wahines!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: In the tradition that has grown through the
years, it is now Toast Time! First up, our host, “A Honey of a
Beekeeper”, Lou Trout..</p>
<p><strong>lout trout</strong>: May the groom’s heart be filled with
hopes and the bride’s feet be filled with lead!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: May the pitter-patter of little feet not
be Maggie’s.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: May the gifts be returned!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: May the back of the dress be as pretty as the
front!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know the old saying, “You’re not losing
a daughter…” Well, I’d like to!</p>
<p><strong>walter and maggie</strong>: – But she’s certainly the
fastest.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t know, give me a minute. Are you all
right with this?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Are you all right with this? You think this is
funny?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t and I don’t think you should…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s a joke. They’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>walter and crowd</strong>: Come on and give us a toast.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You want me to make a toast? Okay… I’ll give
you a toast. To Maggie’s family and friends. May you find yourselves the
bull’s eye of an easy target. May you be publicly flogged for all of
your bad choices and may your noses to rubbed in all of your
mistakes…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: That was funny. But enough toasts, let’s
hula. Let’s start the music up.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Hey, Bob. I got twenty dollars bet on–</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Maggie. Maggie. Here. She may need this. It’s
not really Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where’d Maggie go?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Oh, she just went to get me something from
the car.</p>
<p><strong>dennis chuffa</strong>: About Bart Starr and football. . Bob
thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’m the only goddamn person in there pulling
for you.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You humiliated me!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is
what everyone else is doing. It’s the theme of this party.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I had it under control. Now they feel sorry
for me.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well, they should. Because they’re about to
watch you hang yourself again.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s fun! It’s high.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Or the sexual habits of locusts?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That was very interesting research George
was doing!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary
tattoo?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I already explained about that.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: And where you ever really going to run the
leper colony in Molokai?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Brian told you that?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Or maybe you just wanted to wear the
headdress.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Every one of those times I was being
supportive. Something you won’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Supportive? You weren’t being supportive. You
were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have
ever laid eyes on.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Lost!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: That’s right. You’re so lost you don’t even
know how you like your eggs.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With
the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it’s egg whites
only, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That’s called changing your mind.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No, that’s called not having a mind of your
own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag
you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don’t want to climb Annapuma.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes I do!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No you don’t. You want a man who will lead you
down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the
feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into
a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man
to wake you up at dawn because he’s burning to talk to you and he can’t
wait another minute to find out what you’ll say. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Stop. Stop it! I’m getting married on
Sunday, and you’re just trying to make me run! Why? Because you’re a
cynical, exploitative, mean-hearted creep who wouldn’t know real love if
it bit him in the armpit! And all you do is tear other people down
and-and-and laugh at them, and criticize what they do, because you’re
too afraid to do anything yourself! I read your column. You never wrote
one about you. I’m not the only one who’s lost and you know it! Am I
right? Well? Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Bob comes outside.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mag. Help me out here. Green Bay. Right
guard.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let me take you back inside, okay?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Jerry Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding
rehearsal and two days before the wedding? She’s already done this.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay, we’re ready. Want me to have Ike leave
now?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No. No – Actually, let’s make Ike the
pastor.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’d rather not.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Come on, it’ll give you a great view. It’s
perfect. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Team effort, Pastor Ike… Cindy, ready? Cindy,
come on.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: He’s going to be the pastor?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yep. I want him to be front and center and
to watch everything.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: What happened at the luau?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: … I don’t even want to talk about the luau.
What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: It’s for the bell.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Bob’s in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Don’t be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize.
Remember what Bob said? “Be the ball.”</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: “Sink the putt.”</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: “Make the shot.”</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: “Nothing but net.”</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: “Never say die.”</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Honey, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: At this pace, it could be an evening
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hold it! Hold it! I think we’re taking this too
fast.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes, I’m spiraling through the air.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay, I’m the pastor. Dearly beloved, blah,
blah, blah. So on and so forth. Ra ta ta ta. Yabada dabada. I now
pronounce you man and wife. Kiss the bride, badum dum. We have the
crescendo that leads to us right back down the aisle and out the…</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’m sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I kissed him back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I caught that. Want to tell me how long
this has been going on?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: About a minute…?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: A little longer for me.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you expect me to say to this?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: How about – “I hope you’ll be very happy
together”?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I hope you’ll be very happy together.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Bob, I’m sorry! At least I backed out before
the wedding. That’s progress!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Well, Maggie – in the words of Mrs. Pressman:
“Holy moly”. Call me later.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Okay. So… what, uh… What just happened? Just
now? Jus then? In there?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t know. I, uh – I frankly don’t even want
to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Me, either.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I love you. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Wait. We have to talk. We have to do some
talking now. Pull up a railing.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: To who? Are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes, you!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well, you do have the dress.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: And the church.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: And the wedding date. There’s the two of us.
So, you think… maybe… You have to go down the aisle with somebody you
love and who love you back.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: So, we’ll…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’m getting married.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Ike’s going to get married.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I love his eyes. I just believe they’re
listening to you.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: His hair… any color.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: I like his tight butt.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Grandma!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: See, this is a mature relationship. She’s
really found it.</p>
<p><strong>dina napoli</strong>: Wedding bells are ringing for the
fourth time today in Hale, Maryland. Maggie Carpenter, “Always a Bride –
Never a Bridesmaid”, will be attempting to complete her fourth wedding
ceremony. We’ll come back on the air when the results are in. Back to
you, Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: The turnout for this morning’s wedding is
usually reserved for royalty or Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter is
Hale, Maryland’s special star and the citizens of Hale are out in full
force today.</p>
<p><strong>t-shirt vendor</strong>: I got “Bye-bye Birdie”. “What part
of ‘I do’ don’t you understand?”… Get your “Runaway Bride” T-shirts
here…</p>
<p><strong>jacki/reporter #3</strong>: Will she or won’t she? That is on
the minds of these several hundreds folks, who are standing here this
morning. Not to mention on the mind of Groom Number #4, ex-USA Today
columnist, Ike Graham, who is missing in action.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He’s not coming. Watch. He’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You and your lucky geese. You always see
geese.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Not eight…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: And in a “V”.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Eight is good… “V” could be Victory.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Rub your ears.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory
does that to me when I hyperventilate.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: We do it to our dog.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s hurting.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: We’ll rub.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: He’s here! He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’ll get the dress.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He’s here!… He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Now’s the time for calm… If you don’t calm
down, you won’t get your dress on… He’s the one… He’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: This is not a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: We have to hurry. The Sunday School kids will
be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>julie murphy</strong>: Well, the groom just pulled up. There
was talk of a “now show”, but he is here.</p>
<p><strong>dina napoli</strong>: Ike Graham is here!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Shoot ours so she has one with an ending.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pressman</strong>: It’s okay. There’s no microphone.
You’re no fun.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Friends. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Of course we are. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Then you’ll be my best man.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Well, I’m good, I don’t know if I’m
best.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Go talk to the pastor and he’ll tell you what
to do. And someone will tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You always looked great in that suit… And
Ike? I’m happy for you, honey.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You look awful.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ike. Need help?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I didn’t want to find out I wasn’t for her in
the fourth quarter.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Got any last minute advice?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Maintain eye contact.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Eye contact. Eye contact.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: I have no idea what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Your job is… the ring. Do you have the
ring?!</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: I just found out I’m best man! I’m lucky I
have a suit… What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ike’spov</strong>: There are most of the TOWNSPEOPLE we’ve
come to know, plus some NEW YORKERS for Ike, with little ponytails.
Armani wire rims, Donna Karan bodysuits. There’s a lot of smirking,
checking out the hicks, forming their stories for cocktail hour. Elaine
is in back all dressed in black, mourning Ike. Mrs. Trout approaches
Ike.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: You should thank Lou and I for the
wedding car – a ’63 Buick.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: Oh, come on. You’re practically
family.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Hello. I’m Fisher.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. trout</strong>: This doesn’t want to come out.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: You just pull a hair from my neck.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat!</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Good luck, Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Thank you, Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m really rooting for this one.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Thank you, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Spit.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No sauntering down the aisle. Just make
time. Let’s just get there.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hi, I’m Elaine from New York.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello. I’m Bob, Maggie’s fourth attempt.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s okay. There’s a lid for every pot.
Besides, I’m comfortable with Ike. I mean, Jack Dempsey lost his
heavyweight title to a New Yorker.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I know. Gene Tunney.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: They’re ready, Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Block the doors!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: There’s a man coming down those steps with
lots of candy in his pockets. If you tickle him, he’ll give candy.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Maggie!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Maggie!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Look, he’s running after her.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Look, he’s in pretty good shape.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Poor Ike.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Maggie!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Where do you think she’s going?</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Wherever it is, she’ll be there by ten-
thirty tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Maggie!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: You okay? I’m closing.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m just finishing up, too.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Want to go to Butch’s for a drink or
something?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, I’m just going to head home.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Wedding. Wedding. You just have to get the
rest of your ducks in a row.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Thank you. You still think that he was….</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Quick. Very quick.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Marry me, Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hi, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I am going to propose, you know. I mean, the
right way. Soon as I turn eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re sweet, Dennis. But you’ve got to go.
I’m closing up. Here’s a candy bar and one for your brother.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’m not giving up. A person shouldn’t give
up.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s Maggie. Home for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: She’s been doing this since the last
wedding. I don’t think it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hey. Grandma, what’s for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: Turkey and cheese.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Honey, your grandmother and I were thinking
about opening a wedding gift museum.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Just stop it. Don’t say another word like
that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maggie, it’s just a joke…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No. It’s my life.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A harmless joke.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, it’s humiliating and you’ve been doing
it since I was a kid. I don’t like it. Stop. You may not like having a
daughter with problems. But guess what? I don’t like having a father
who’s drunk all the time. I’ll eat in my room.</p>
<p><strong>grandma julia</strong>: That needed to be said. You know –
you’re always making jokes about her, so they won’t make jokes about
your drinking.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I need a plan… A plan to life… What would
Bruce Lee do? He’d kick some ass…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hello, Ike.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Don’t tell me. My doorman is one of your many
admires… I knew I should have given him a better Christmas gift.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’ve been making friends with your cat. Is
it okay that I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I don’t have much choice in the matter now, do
I? But I can’t speak for Italics. Traitor!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I don’t blame you for being mad…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here
on business? I saw your lamps. They’re terrific.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s something I’ve always wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You actually could make breaking and entering
into a new career. So, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I wanted to talk to you about why I run or
ride away from things.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I think so… When I was walking down the
aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn’t have any idea who I
really was. And it was only half the other person’s fault, because I had
done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it
was good that I didn’t go through with it because it would have been a
lie, but you – you knew the real me.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I didn’t. And you being the one at the end
of the aisle didn’t just fix that.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: No, I couldn’t fix anything… But I still ended
up chasing a truck.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I understand why you bring up the truck. Let
me explain something. The fact is, you’ve seen me at my worst, most
embarrassing, deviously plotting, potentially but not certifiably,
psychotic state. And if you liked me then, I mean, now… I can’t imagine…
Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Should I be writing this down?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: These are for you.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Used?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: They’re mine. I’m turning in my running
shoes to you.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: This is getting serious.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: And one more thing. I know it’s hard to
believe there could be more. Um…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Oh my God. No.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, no – don’t hide your face, this only
happens once in a lifetime. It’s definitely a first to me, and you’re
not going to want to miss it.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Maggie, I gotta think about this a little
bit.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You were not.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I was, because if you said “yes” right away,
I wouldn’t get to say this next part. And I’ve been practicing it.
Ready?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: “I guarantee that we’ll have tough times. I
guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out.
But I also guarantee that if I don’t ask you to be mine, I’ll regret it
for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart – you’re the only
one for me”.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Pretty good speech, Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Dance with me.</p>
