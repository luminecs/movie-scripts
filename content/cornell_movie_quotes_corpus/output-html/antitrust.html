<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wow. That’s hard. I’d have to say it’s the
day we launched Outpost ’98.</p>
<p><strong>different voice</strong>: It’s the beverages.</p>
<p><strong>daryl</strong>: Gary always makes sure we’ve got the coolest
stuff to drink.</p>
<p><strong>different voice</strong>: Knowing your work means
something.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Knowing everywhere in the world, this is the
software people use.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: 20 years ago, Gary had an idea, that’s all he
had. And now the company’s bigger than IBM.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s the people. Which is weird.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Big companies are s’posed to be
impersonal.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: Programmers play competitive games at an
Outpost picnic; Toddlers play on computers in an Outpost Day Care
Center; Geeks confer at a diagram-covered whiteboard; Employees
listen/dance to the Seattle band we’ve been hearing, on-stage, at the
Outpost ’98 launch.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: There’s this myth that doing a start- up is
cooler. But there’s no community with a start-up. No permanence.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: It bums me out when the media say we’re
cultish, or whatever. Why? ’Cause we care about each other?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: ’Love you too, bro.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ll tell you what’s not cool.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How Gary gets this superbad rap.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: There’s this prejudice against super- smart
people. People like Gary.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: A kid working in his garage can create the
next Outpost, the new IBM. All it takes is a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: That’s why nobody can have a monopoly in a
business built on ideas.</p>
<p><strong>different voice</strong>: The coolest? Gary. He’s like you or
me. If we happened t’be insanely rich.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Can we go?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For me? It’s Seattle!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: ’Starting to get nauseated.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>voice from the movie</strong>: Did anybody mention the
beverages?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: They still have to give ’em refreshments
laced with mind-altering drugs.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You are a fanatic.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: ’Gonna wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up
with Teddy and me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: “Make” him?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m not exactly worldly, but I’m the
Secretary of State next to him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And they’re all throwing this – stuff at him.
Stock options. Pay packages.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m just screwed.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You know what he’s like. He just wants to
work on stuff that’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You don’t wanna move, do you?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I can paint anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’d like to stay here, yeah. And I kind of
think he should be with Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I mean, nobody else can follow what they’re
talking about half the time.</p>
<p><strong>milo/teddy</strong>: ’Could be a condition-variable in the
locking code – If it didn’t seg fault, first!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Maybe you shouldn’t push it so hard. About
Outpost. No offense, you sound insane.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can’t help it. I feel like they’d do
anything to keep their –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Anything? That’s not even credible. If he
wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.
It’s his life. But everybody’s treating him like this – valuable object.
You’re hurting your own case.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: He’s my god. I hear he actually calls
recruits sometimes. Or is that an Urban Legend?</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Gary’s running the biggest software company
in the world, Brian. He’s being harassed by the Justice Department, and
he’s got a new baby.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Milo? I’m Danny.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh hi.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Gary would like to speak to you?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Milo? Gary Boyd. I’m hoping you and your
friend can come up here. We’ve made some amazing strides in digital
convergence. I’d love to show them to you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You would? Wow. When would we come? ’Think he
hung up.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: But how does he know that’s what you guys’re
working on?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: All the companies know. The faculties tell
’em. At the target schools.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: In exchange for endowments. They should just
drop the pretense and name the schools after ’em.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I can’t believe you refused a ticket!</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: My parents’re already freaked-out I’m staying
here. 50 miles from Chinatown.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well maybe if you told ’em how much money
you’d be making – You’re going up there. Right?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I think you should go.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I mean, it’s your life.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I think I kind of lost it. I was just so
thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful… ’Didn’t know I
even cared about that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: C’mon, how often do you talk to somebody
who’s been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: A lot of what Larry says is true. They just
clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their
inferior version cause they –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Then you’ve gotta ask him about that.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: If he’s really a bully, he won’t cop to it,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or
your dad.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: When I was a kid? And he was moving us all
over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I
thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: But he’s not quite the same guy anymore.
Don’t get your hopes too high?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: ’Couldn’t convince Teddy to come?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He’s pretty tight with his family.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We could move ’em up here.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He just likes to write code. He’s bummed
there’s so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own
everything.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Who do you mean by “everybody.”</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So – how far are we from the campus?</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Oh we’re not going to the campus.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I think they call him the “Houseman.” ’Cause
“guard” sounds too weird.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t be nervous. The house is the weirdest
thing about him.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: It’s like he knows everybody expects him to
be this worldly, colorful zillionaire. But he’s just a guy who likes
software.</p>
<p><strong>houseman</strong>: Have a seat. He won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it’s
no-sale.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a
Justice Dept. problem?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There is no public offering. The guy who wrote
it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. ’Wrote this just to
run their web site.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Milo? Excuse the tie. I was on TV.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: The house knows the paintings I like, it knows
my favorite music. Same for anybody else who’s in the system.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Cool!</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Would you like a Coke or something?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh. No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: When we started, I just hired my smart
friends. That was great. We got a little bigger, I had to hire smart
strangers. Much harder.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Now I don’t get to hire anybody. But I know
you’re the guy to write Skywire.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know a lot about art, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: There’s a rumor going around, maybe you’ve
heard it.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: There’s more to life than computers? I’m
looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: ’Once I start looking into something.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I’ve only shown this to three other people. I
bought 200, we’ve launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this
room. It’s left over from SDI. Reagan’s Star Wars technology? They orbit
426 miles up.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Low enough to relay internet traffic.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Among other things… We know convergence is the
real super-highway: all the PC’s, TV’s, phones, etc. linked together.
Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Skywire.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: The content filer has t’be written into the
media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by
multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware
emerges.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It needs a more object-oriented language. This
doesn’t scale, does it?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You’d have to start practically from scratch.
But this is all you’d be working on. No marketing meetings, no product
seminars. We can’t waste the time. Half the Valley’s working on
convergence. So’re media conglomerates, cable companies, phone
companies. ’Can’t finish second, Milo. There is no second… Now what
would you like to ask me?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …Ask you?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I know what people say, and not just the
Justice Department. We clone ideas, inflict our second-rate versions on
the world, we haven’t done anything original since 1.0.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Do I think that’s fair? No. I’d put some of
our apps up against anybody’s. But is there some truth to it?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: When you get to a certain age, you start
wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0
–</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I do!</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote
that. But I’m 42, that’s 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the
things that got me here. But somehow got away.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: If my dad’d leveled with me like that even
once… The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old
Gary? It’s his fantasy, too.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I think that’s great, Milo. I do.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …But?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Didn’t you visit the campus?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I forgot. That’s why you have to help me
decide.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No way. You have this – destiny.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: C’mon, I wouldn’t have a destiny without you.
My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Don’t bring that up. Like a different
girlfriend would’d’ve let you die?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You saved my life in alot of ways.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s not just Gary that makes you wanna go
there? ’Cause it’s a big place. You might not even see him again.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: When’s Brian coming for the TV?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Prob’ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to
call. We’ll leave it for him?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: ’Give you guys some time alone.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …You got my E-mail?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: And your phone messages. You wanna do what
you do, it’s not a crime.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Is that how Larry feels?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Uh. Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Wanted to say goodbye to him…</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A
million-five!</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. You know
what’s the bad part? We can’t talk about work anymore. We’re
competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100
confidentiality forms.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Outpost made me sign 1,000. ’Guess we’ll find
out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Guess what? They got their –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the Justice
Department. Sorry about the glass.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Don’t worry, Milo. I’m here as a friend. Or
maybe a supplicant.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Right… What’s that mean again?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Beggar. We’re at a disadvantage with
Outpost. Our experts aren’t as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can’t tell
which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart
guy to help us pick our fights. I’m taking a shot in the dark, here. I
can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I’m hoping you’ve got a feeling
it’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s just – I kind of feel the need to do
something with my ability. Create something…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Like I said: shot in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: If you see something there that rubs you the
wrong way? Do the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That took some fun out of –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We’re not gonna let it.</p>
<p><strong>cnn voice</strong>: – ingested the fatal mixture of sedatives
crushed in apple sauce. According to the cult’s eerily professional
website, it was “time to move on…”</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: There’re 20 buildings, I mean not counting
the Gyms, the Day Care, etc.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Gary’s put millions in there. And the
people with kids? They’re not hotshot geeks, they’re just payroll clerks
or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: You’ll see alot of that: Department of
Justice goons snooping around.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: So how’d you like the house?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: His Snapples were in alphabetical order.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Well, he micro-managed the company till it
got too big… ’Guess he needs to micro-manage something.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Milo, I’m Judith. Welcome!</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Everybody has the same office, there’s no
dumbass corporate hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>desi</strong>: Get out while you can, dude!</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Desi, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>desi</strong>: The guy who was at Gary’s house?</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Best bomb shelters in America, accessible
from every building. You gotta figure we’re a major target, right?</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Every geek here’s got a thing for Lisa. But
that’s about the biggest reaction she’s had to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: She’s a programmer?</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Heavy graphical background, doing
design-interface for Skywire apps. You’ll be working with her.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’ve got a girlfriend, remember?</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Right. That’s rare around here. You know
how nuns’ re-married to Jesus? ’Posties are married to Outpost.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Here’s your world. Copy of Gary’s book,
also the audio version, narrated by Gary.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The card’s encoded. Tells us who came through
the door and when.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Unauthorized entries sound like this.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: If you see a tailgater, report him.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Tailgater?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Somebody coming in on your swipe.</p>
<p>****: You see somebody wandering around without ID, it’s your duty to
challenge him. I don’t give a shit if you’re a stock-option billionaire.
If you don’t challenge, I’ll have your butt.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He seems a little – tense.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Geeks pull his chain cause he’s non- tech.
Ex-cop or something. They moon cameras, or use ATM’s as swipe cards. The
cameras’re our real security so he’s a little demoralized.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What’re they building?</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: #21. Way behind schedule. It’s top- secret,
but everybody knows it’s a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes
on top, the fiber optics going in.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gary’s not into fiber optics. He’s betting
everything on the satellites.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: You wanna survive in the software business,
you cover your bets… I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever
requested.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Oh, right. Your girlfriend’s an artist.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: I phoned her at your hotel, told her about
our corporate housing options. She sounds neat.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …She is. She is!</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: ’Might be some friction on the domestic
front. You’re expected you to put in ridiculous hours. People’ve accused
us of breaking up relationships to get their undivided attention.</p>
<p><strong>redmond</strong>: Your counselor’ll fill you in on everything
else. That’s who you’ll be working with almost daily.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Busy?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by
and introduce himself.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Okay. I’m Gary.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: ’Think I should buy some originals?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …Do I?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Somebody said I’m just another Philistine.
With reproductions.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s insane. You’re ahead of your time.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: That’s what I told her. My wife.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: ’Thinks I’ll be less of a control freak if I
have a hobby. ’Just gives me something else to obsess about…</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Anything we can salvage from the old code
before you start fresh?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Uh, might be one or two things.</p>
<p><strong>geek 1</strong>: He’s been in there like an hour.</p>
<p><strong>geek 2</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Could work with a new switch. There may be a
few more things hidden.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Don’t spend too much time searching. You ever
vetted somebody’s old code before? It’s a different skill. Stay close to
the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the
best place to hide a leaf, right? In a tree.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: …The corporate condos were as romantic as
they sound.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know he’s never been anybody’s counselor
before?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo! What about –?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, It’s great. It’s great! ’Think I should
tell him I learned everything using 1.0? Maybe I could show him one of
my early programs.</p>
<p><strong>doj agent</strong>: “Infotek’s urgent need to license Outpost
Office is such that we can use it as a tool in the current negotiation.”
When you wrote the word “tool,” what’d you mean by it?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>doj agent</strong>: What d’you think you meant by it?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I’m confused. Am I supposed to speculate under
oath?</p>
<p><strong>other agent</strong>: Since you didn’t have an answer to that
question, Mr. Boyd –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Didn’t I? Have an answer? “I don’t
remember.”</p>
<p><strong>doj agent</strong>: Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Your protege’s moving so fast we can barely
keep up with him.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: This is good. Who did it?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: ’Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid’s on
Prozac.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Maybe we should all get on it.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Maybe I’m going too fast.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Too fast? At least four companies’re on the
verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Even when I had a hand in every aspect of the
company I knew the one thing you can never control is somebody’s
creative process.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s okay. Really.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Take a look at this. Slightly different
approach.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You did this – overnight?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You’re making me young again.</p>
<p><strong>news voice</strong>: …A graduate of MIT, he was on the
antidepressant Prozac, and had been warned not to drink and drive.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You know my name.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know mine.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re famous around here.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m getting a teacher’s pet rep.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about it. You’ve gotta figure
most people around here were their teachers’ pets.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …Were you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We moved around so much I barely knew my
teachers.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Me too! Were you an Army brat or
something?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: …Something like that. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Didn’t mean to pry. I just have this theory.
Some of us who got to good at this? We were – escaping something.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Did I say something?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my
life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense.
Sometimes you think they’ve betrayed you. Like a person would. But then
you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all
work.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I used to wish that. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What’ve you got there?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I’m s’posed
to coordinate with you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Cool!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging
from the narrowest bandwidth to –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …Sh-Show me the next one.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Have a seat. He’s with someone, but I
know he wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Because we bundled it, the judge is
threatening to enjoin the whole –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I’m confused, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Didn’t you tell me they’d be Chapter 12 by the
time they could hope to enjoin? I’m very confused, because you said
they’d be ready to settle.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Go on in. He’s always happy to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Milo. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Well – you sent for me.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Right… Right.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You really wrote this just today?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What’re you implying.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Everything I do is under scrutiny. The
questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I’m
confused. Doesn’t everybody in business try to get ahead?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: The purpose of this company isn’t to destroy
our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But
the software business is binary: you’re a zero or a one. Being obsessive
isn’t a crime. It’s a character trait.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: It scales, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: This feels fairly grown up, I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: To our new life. …What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That’s what I need to ask you. You know you
can’t keep anything from me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I
said, “Did you really do this just today?” Cause I was impressed. He
said “What’re you implying?”</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s the way he said it. Just the way my dad
did, when he was caught in a lie. That’s how you knew you were onto
something ugly.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What would it mean, anyway? If he didn’t
write it?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s what I’m asking myself. Does he have
some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. ’Not saying it
makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He’s your boss. He’s not your –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: If you can’t deal with him on that basis, you
better get a new counselor.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Isn’t that – extreme?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What’s extreme is what that ER doctor said
when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I mean, if one little comment from Gary is
gonna upset you this much –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re right. It’s – a working relationship.
Don’t know what I was expecting.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: C’mon. Let’s do the toast?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Did you wanna be alone?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No. Please.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire
apps. How fast are you going?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: “There is no second place.” Plus every time I
get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. Is it like that with your
counselor?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Mine’s not the CEO. He barely remembers to
take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Right, right. But does he ever just, like,
hand you code?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re compulsive.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Mmm-more like – I have a little trouble.
Trusting people.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Long story. Not that interesting.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So, when you were talking about wishing people
were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Then and now. But not right now.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Milo!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Just dropped off a resume. Almost got in the
front door.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re living here?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: ’Thought if I relocated it could help my
case. I’m writing programs for the local public access station. Where
any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck. Can
you help me?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Sure, I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well I parked illegally. See y’later?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: ’Forgot to introduce you. I have a
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s great. I – didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: She saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: How’s it going down there?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I’ve been hacking for five night’s straight,
I’m really making headway.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: But these, like, White Supremacists trashed
my office, last week.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: They’re in the neighborhood. They usually
hassle Vietnamese grocers.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Jesus, Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I’m cool. They didn’t touch the machine. Or
my disks. Probably didn’t know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?
Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I met this girl.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: What? Come on. Is it serious?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Did you tell Alice?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No! I keep thinking it’ll go away. But there’s
this – connection. She’s been hacking since she was little, she had to
move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we’re working on the same
program. She’s – beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: A beautiful geek? I don’t wanna sound
paranoid, or like a pig, but what’re the chances?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I dunno. I guess Larry’s got me totally
suspicious of that place.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Milo, geeks don’t have two girlfriends. Most
don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I didn’t plan this.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What’d the girl say?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There may be a little less trust after your
outburst.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hasn’t affected his work, though.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Nothing does. Still. I want him to like
me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Teddy was killed last night.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What’re you – what?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It was a hate crime.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: They trashed his hard disk, all his
back-ups. Nothing’s left.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They caught the guys?</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: It’s an airtight case. They found the weapon
with Teddy’s blood on it and their fingerprints. They’d been arrested
twice for beating-up Asians. How come they weren’t in jail?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He told me about the break-in. He didn’t seem
to take it that seriously.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: You guys don’t take anything seriously do
you? That’s not on a hard drive?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Nelson? Your mom wants you. It’s time to go
to scatter the ashes.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I didn’t know he was working with fiber
optics.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We gotta go too, honey.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could
come down here and –</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You are naive. Look at your employment
contract: you can’t work anywhere else in this field for at least few
years. Not that I don’t miss you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Just thought his work should go on.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He was on the verge of something, too. He was
gonna show us the next day. He said “The answer’s not in the box, it’s
in the band.” Know what it means?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s only meaningful when you’ve got 40,000
lines of code to back it up.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He
had his own style.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Those really weird, short lines.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Take good care of this guy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I heard what happened.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Were the flags for Teddy?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Had you talked to him much lately?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Just once. ’Guess I was worried we didn’t have
anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Talk about work? Never!</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I meant did you find other stuff to –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You’ve been coming in early.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus
on something. ’Don’t know what I’d do without her.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You okay? I miss him, too.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code
there…</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: 34,000. But they’re real short lines. ’Just
came out that way.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Been thinking about the push mechanism in the
handler. And it came over me: it’s in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: The wrong place?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: The answer’s not in the box. It’s in the
band.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Milo? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gotta go home. ’Think I ate something.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Alice? Alice!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Are you saying you think they had something
to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t know what I’m saying. Maybe – maybe
they hired those guys.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I can’t see Outpost putting its reputation in
the hands of people like that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t know! I just know it was Teddy’s code.
All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says “Any kid
working in his garage can put us out of business?” It’s like they know
what every kid’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They hack into people’s programs?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nobody does work like this on-line. It’s in
your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They’d have to be, like,
watching people. Physically. Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s a camera.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It isn’t a broadcast studio. It’s – a
surveillance post or something. That’s why they have the dishes on
top.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re scaring me. I think we should just
go.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Go where? You can’t get away from people like
this.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: “Like this?” It’s Gary you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You think I don’t know that?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo. Why would he –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: How should I know? “Solving a problem,” I
guess. Or needing to control everything. I don’t know. I’ve gotta get in
there.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Even if all this were true. There’re 20 other
buildings. All of them filled with computers and –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s the only one with dishes on the roof. The
studio’s a front. That’s why they keep postponing its opening. …gotta
get in there.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all
over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? And how
can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I can’t just walk away!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You can’t just walk in, either.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They stop the construction work at six or
seven. The parking lot’s mostly clear by two or three in the morning.
Even the early Geeks don’t get there before five.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever
really noticed?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No! I can’t just keep my head in the sand.
That’s how I got into this mess.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know how to get in there. But you’ve gotta
help me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: …Whaddo I do?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Just tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sir, you gotta use your own – Where’s your
ID?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: It’s my job, I gotta –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: The kind of stock options I’m sitting on?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Every geek has to try this once to show me
how smart he is –</p>
<p><strong>another guard</strong>: There was an explosion in a Y-sector
closet, we’re evacuating the whole sector.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Un-nh, can’t wander around without ID now.
Just park your ass in that chair.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Whole place reeks of fuckin’ ammonia.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the
civil defense sign? Some geek’s idea of irony. I been saying we need a
camera in this hall.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: There’s nothing in this hall. Someone’s
pulling your chain, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Unless it’s a diversion. Milo’s in my office.
He was tailgating, so I –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to think.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: That kid’s the great white hope.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: I could get it out of him.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: You’re not listening.</p>
<p><strong>record cycle will cause bit overload. do you wish to
proceed?</strong>: Y/N. He types Y.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: How’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Big night. Switched from tea to coffee.
Brought new meaning to my work.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Yeah? Maybe I’ll start my rounds with #21
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You are a wild man.</p>
<p><strong>on milo</strong>: pressing himself into the alcove.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well. Now he knows: nothin’ in there.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Maybe he’ll get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Speaking of which…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …in a tree…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you download Corey? In San Jose?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Damn. ’Have to go back over there. Be so much
easier if we could walk in the front door.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You don’t look anything like a three-
year-old.</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: – run this methamphetamine lab
known to Federal Authorities, per ND 47, from which we removed the
implement, fingerprints intact.</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: FBI footage, procured by ND 47,
shows the aftermath of an Aryan Nations’ killing in Denver. Note the
evidence of torture, which is typical.</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: – complete immersion in
code-writing renders him both unobservant and suggestible . On two
occasions he went truant from classes to attend Comix Conventions.</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: – Rebecca P, a Connecticut art
stu- dent facing Federal drug charges, whose records were supplied to us
by</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: Armed with his personal files,
she was easily able to ingratiate herself with the socially maladroit
Milo –</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: …she planted the sesame seed
both to test the extent of his proclivity and to provide a bonding
experience, since she would quote “save his life.”</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: – should it be needed Milo’s
allergy is the ideal –</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: Note that the cult members are
found reclining after swallowing the Syringe marks best hidden at base
of scrotum mimics high blood alcohol indistinguishable from kidney
failure.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Please don’t be one of them.</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: …needs to be watched, due to
her heightened level of suspicion –</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: – and to her possible contagion
of key employees.</p>
<p><strong>multimedia narrator</strong>: In August ’86 Lisa informed her
mother of the sexual molestation by her stepfather, and of his threat to
kill her should she tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: brings up a shot of a Programmer at work,
zooms in on his screen to begin collecting his code.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his
brow and, worse, on his hands. They’re giving way.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: clicks. A printer across the room start
making a hard- copy of the purloined code.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: stares in horror as the data tower his toes
are jammed on top of starts to shift – threatening to disengage from its
ports. He tries to lift it back up with heels of his shoes.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: knits his brow as his screen flickers. He
keeps typing, but starts to lower his head: he’s going to look under the
table.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: winces as he presses the tower upward with his
heels, while trying to maintain his balance…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the
screen, hits keys. Just as he is about to clear the level of the table –
the screen re-illumines. He comes back up.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: having extended his legs to support the tower,
feels his hands slipping…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: closes up the window…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: flops to the carpet just as –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He gave me this. ’Said I should come see him
if –</p>
<p><strong>doj receptionist</strong>: He’s not in yet.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Can I wait in his office?</p>
<p><strong>doj receptionist</strong>: It’s locked, dear.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>doj receptionist</strong>: Wait in his outer office.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker</strong>: Do I make the call, or do you?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Mr. Barton, do you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …It’s – Milo, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yes sir. I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Give me two seconds with Lacy here? Go on
in, I won’t be a moment.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’ll make the call, but I think you need to
send a Fax first .</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What seems to be the problem? You look a
little upset.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I am. I am, sir.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed
in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: My goodness.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It was racially motivated. He’s Chinese. He
was. And… I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: If there’s a Civil Rights violation. But
generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I – just wanna help bring these guys to
justice. They’re neo-Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Let me look into it, see what’s being done.
Frankly, it’s not my area.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: ’Just didn’t know who else to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: And Outpost? You’re happy there?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: ’Didn’t mention he was going to the Justice
Department?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that
without telling you. You’re not losing your hold on him, are you?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He’ll tell me when he gets home.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’ll be a test, won’t it?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Instead of busting my chops you should do
something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Lisa’s an extremely valuable member of the
Skywire team. We’ve got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Prick.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s almost nine, I’ve been so worried! What
did you see in there?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s what they said it is. An unfinished
broadcast studio. You were right… I just drove to Seattle and back.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: …Why?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Remember Lyle Barton?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: The Justice Department guy who came to the
apartment when –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: After I broke into 21 – which was insane,
thank God they didn’t catch me! – I just drove around. Trying to figure
out what possessed me. You know what? I’ve been putting my own guilt on
Gary.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Guilt?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: If I’d stayed down there, maybe this
wouldn’t’ve happened.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Poor baby. You know that’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I thought, instead of indulging all these
paranoid delusions, risking my job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I
should do something useful with my grief. Help them find Teddy’s
killers.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I was so worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …been such a long night.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That was – different.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …Different?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You didn’t feel it? So intense.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: So you’re not avoiding me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I snuck into #21.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why would you do a thing like –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You thought about it too. You’ve been
suspicious for a while. But it’s not happening in there. It’s happening
in the Day Care.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The Day Care?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Can we go someplace else?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s easy to know who the smart geeks are, the
schools tell ’em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy
files. They’d be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program
gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But why would they –?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know. There is no second place. And what’s
the risk? The killings’re undetectable, they’re hand-tailored, they make
“sense.” I mean, they’re in the information business. They have
scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m not one of them. Not trying to “suss you
out.”</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They killed my best friend! I’m living with
somebody they pay to go to bed with me. Can’t you trust somebody just
once? I don’t wanna be alone here.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m sorry, Milo… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know why you’re so secretive. Why you won’t
let anybody near you. I know what he did to you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: So that’s in my – file?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Is that my – scenario? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They’d frame him.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He’s out of prison?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They’re already watching you. If they had to,
they’d give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He’d wake
up not even remembering his “act of revenge.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nobody’s gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: …Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I always felt if a – boy I liked ever found
out – he’d run. He’d think I was unclean.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No, no. Never.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: All his suspicions were allayed?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re sure.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He said it made sense that Gary’s code was
like Teddy’s, that that clich� about great minds was true. Said it was
all about his own guilt. Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up
with his dad once in a while. It always passes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He wasn’t acting?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I don’t think he knows how.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What about the FBI?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They’ve got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others.
We tell the wrong person, it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Who can we trust?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: There’s always a logical answer – you just
have to define the question.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How do you let go of a secret without telling
the wrong person.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We don’t tell anybody. We tell everybody. At
once. So there’s no secret left to protect. When everybody knows, they
don’t dare touch us.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: No, Tony can’t fill in for you, he’s not at
your authorization level.</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: Bob? You better look at this.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Do we post it on the Net?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: There’re so many disinformation sites about
Gary already. Where he has devil’s horns or they crop him in with Saddam
Hussein.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Could it be a glitch? Something the
construction workers caused?</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call
Randy and Phil? Tell ’em there may have been a break-in?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Not yet. ’Love to bust my ass cause I’m not
in frigging Mensa. I swear to God, it’s that kid Milo, I told ’em so in
the first place, but they didn’t even wanna hear about it. Let’s run a
printout on card entries.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The mainstream media. TV, or a
newsmagazine.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Right. But Gary’s tied-in to a lot of media
conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We could cross-reference a data base on media
ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Certainly not at my happy home.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gary, hi.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You look a little tired.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m okay. It’s going well!</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: ’Have a look?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Why did you move around so much? When you were
a kid.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he
didn’t think he was. That applied to guys who didn’t have a “system.”
“Losers,” who played games of chance. He could “read” people, so chance
had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself,
he’d give you the whole speech. And you’d better not point out the
obvious. His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever.
He’d wake us in the middle of the night. Off we’d go, again.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What would you tell the kids? At your new
school? You had to come up with a good story, right?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No. I just went deeper into the machine.
Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would’ve been
worse.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: …Worse?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. “Get
your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world.” The more he
mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him –
Guess that’s why I’m kind of clueless, even now. Didn’t cultivate my
conniving side. ’Not sure I even have one.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Don’t be so hard on yourself. With a brain
like yours, you could connive with the best of ’em I bet.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He’s buying up pretty much everything: cable
companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives…
Getting ready for Skywire.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What about “60 Minutes.”</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah, they dig stuff like this. “CBS News has
partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due
to launch Fall of 2001.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But still, you can’t say CBS wouldn’t love to
break something like –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Say there’s just one “mole” working there,
like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he’s not the guy we’ve contacted?
Or she? Or the guy she works for?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Time?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary’s
set-top device. That also takes out CNN. “GE joins Outpost in new
venture,” which means NBC is out. “Disney joins Outpost,” ABC is out.
“Outpost and Newscorp in new deal,” Fox is out. Any of these places
could have a mole. Or all of ’em. It’s like a a continuous loop. We can
go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and
us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a
subsidiary to something Gary’s got a finger in!</p>
<p><strong>homework kid</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How close are you?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He’s got 12 satellites up. He’s got dishes on
top of 21. He’s building this – mega-network for Skywire. Let’s use
it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We can’t just assume they’re standing by to
receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I’d have to write in an
aglet.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s how on-line services push logos they
wanna sell you. You don’t ask for ’em, they just appear. ’Have to work
on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of
the broadcast wouldn’t exactly be digital, that’s 12 months away.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But they’d still get the idea, right?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’d have to design a graphic interface to
make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How
long would that take you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s a standard GUI. Once I’ve got a concept,
it’s maybe three day’s work.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gary knows I’m close on Skywire. We have to do
this fast.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Before they kill somebody else, too.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, man. I’d have to get into Gary’s house. To
get the satellite positions.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You mean – break in?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21
aren’t hot yet? You said the place isn’t finished.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll go look. They’ll just have a few more
pictures of me snooping around.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Why were you so careless?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I thought the worst they would do is fire me.
Who knew they took termination so literally?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Why were you snooping in my office?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: ’Think everybody in this place is here the
same reason we are?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: ’Cause their apartments might be bugged?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I told Teddy about you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: “A beautiful geek? What’re the chances?”</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I felt guilty. ’Cause I “owed so much” to
Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so
consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking
for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it’s all anybody wants from you.
You grow older but you don’t grow up. You turn into – into –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Gary.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Larry used to say how the guys who wrote the
first cool operating systems, like the UNIX guys at Berkeley? They just
gave it away. They figured it was human knowledge, it belonged to the
world, like Shakespeare or aspirin. ’Know what I’m gonna do after we
broadcast the incriminating stuff? Air the Skywire code. Then nobody can
have a monopoly.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Where were you? You know you can’t keep
anything from me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Okay, yeah. I did something naughty… There’s
this amazing Comix store in Seattle. To tell you the truth, I did it
once or twice at Stanford. ’Guess I can’t keep anything from you…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I won’t turn you in.</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: Every entry was authorized.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: What’re we looking for?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Any irregularity in the pattern.</p>
<p><strong>tv voice</strong>: Last years’ party-goers pledged over $2
million to the Museum; this year’s event promises to raise even more.
Lured in part by the chance to see the stunning Boyd house…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Why doesn’t he ask us to his party. He’s never
even met you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He has thousands of employees, Milo –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s for the Museum. He knows you’re a
painter. If anybody should be invited –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know you think I’m too attached to him, but
still. I am close to Gary. And you’re the most meaningful person in my
life. I’m going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing
myself.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo, you –</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey! Get down here!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed just before
finals.</p>
<p><strong>sister beatrice</strong>: None of us knows how to use it. I’m
thinking of taking a course. May I?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>sister beatrice</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I needed t’see it up close for a graphic. The
outpost with a dish on top? I climbed up there to get it right.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Next time you ask.</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: ’Might of found something.</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without
leaving the first time.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Let’s get him in here.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I
get a passable version of Skywire we’re there.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The dishes are juiced up, too.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21.
I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They know I broke in. Alice helped me. Shrot’s
not one of them. He’s blundering into this on his own.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He doesn’t know about the Day Care.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hardly anybody does, that’s the beauty part.
No cameras, the DOJ doesn’t bother with it, it’s accessed by a tunnel
they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Yeah, that’s old, in a tree.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered
the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I’m giving a benefit for the art museum
Thursday night. Thought you’d like to bring Alice.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s great! Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: ’Sorry about the late notice…</p>
<p><strong>desi</strong>: “Sorry about the late notice?”</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Why did you enter #21 twice?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: This thing’s screwed-up. Look here. ’Shows
me going into the Day Care that night. I never been in the Day Care.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: One window’ll be obits I downloaded, based on
the scenarios you described. The other windows’ll accommodate the
surveillance stuff you told me about. The idea is, this works with
anything, since we can’t edit.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Same with the excerpts I’m choosing: they’ll
play against any of the images you described.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Perfect. How am I gonna get away from the
party long enough to –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You could always say you have to go the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s lame, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’ll come up with something.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They called the house to ask who’s your
favorite painter.</p>
<p><strong>houseman</strong>: Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence is
restricted.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Alice, I’m Gary. This is my wife, Clarissa.
Milo, this is Barry Linder, who’s visiting from Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>linder</strong>: I hate being the Hollywood guy. It’s so
limiting. Meet my friend, Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Barry’s studio’s gonna help fill the Skywire
pipeline, thought you guys should meet.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: the orchestra, playing.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: a group of SOCIETY TYPES chatting.</p>
<p><strong>society woman</strong>: He’s a sweetheart. He gave 10,000
PC’s to the Library Association.</p>
<p><strong>society man</strong>: All 10,000 of which will be signed onto
his browser, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>society woman</strong>: And so what?!</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: Wait’ll all the books are on-line.</p>
<p><strong>society woman</strong>: And so what?</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa,
Ricky. Milo looks utterly preoccupied…</p>
<p><strong>linder</strong>: The merchandising implications are epic. A
kid’s watching the movie, he points and clicks at the laser blaster –
before the reel’s even over he’s ordered the toy.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: But, I mean – Devil’s Advocate – won’t that
influence the content? Won’t the artists complain? The directors or
writers or whoever?</p>
<p><strong>linder</strong>: Artists? Darling, the only art left in
America is business. You’re in Picasso’s house!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Where’s the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>linder</strong>: The irreverence!</p>
<p><strong>houseman</strong>: You’ll have to use one over there.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: There’s like eight women waiting in line. They
take forever. Please?</p>
<p><strong>houseman</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: “Dear Lisa. I’ve enjoyed working with you. I’d
be lying if I didn’t say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know
that Alice…” You left my party to send E-mail?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I couldn’t do it at work cause of security or
at home for – obvious reasons.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You could’ve handwritten it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m not much good at handwriting. Or
parties.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Oh, that’s right. You’re “clueless.”</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gary, I’m sorry if I was rude –</p>
<p><strong>houseman</strong>: Everything OK, Mr. Boyd?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: No problem. Is there?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gary, I –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You see what’s hanging on the wall?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just
because of what you’re doing. Because of who you are.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I
thought I was coming here for a job. But it’s meant a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: When will you have a Beta version?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m pretty close. But when I wrote the last
contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know
what it’s like, writing software.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I do know. You focus on the big problem. But
somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets
destroyed. At first it’s upsetting. You feel you’ve lost control.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: So you have to remind yourself: it’s just the
process. Something’s always lost along the way to anything worthwhile.
Some little bug, some glitch. ’Can’t get bogged down in that, you’re
doing something other people could never do. They lack the imagination,
the brain, the nerve. Let them fret about every unforeseen consequence.
You have to solve the problem. That’s who you are.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Are you gonna tell me where you went?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I went to see the Skywire model in Gary’s
office. You know. Just to hold it again.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Are you having an affair, Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just
now. To tell her how I feel about you. You know I’m clueless, without
you. You know I –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Just shut up?</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don’t
use but geeks do. What would Milo want in here, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: They know. ’Just they don’t trust me with it.
So we’ll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Does he know you know?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He suspects I know something. I think he was
sort of – explaining himself to me, in case I do. We have to go in
tonight. I’m two hours from a Beta version. But I’ve gotta go home for
an hour.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: She called to apologize. I said I was pulling
an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always
do when we fight, it’s suspicious if I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Please don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: At this point the worst thing I could do is
anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Here’s the interface.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook, since
we’re always afraid for you to eat in Chinese restaurants. I’ve been
mincing things into teeny-tiny pieces all afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Look at me! I’m gonna change.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I know you. You’re gonna run back to work
right after dinner. I want my kiss now.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Don’t we have any chopsticks?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh, right. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: One more minute…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …wanna savor this.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s gonna get cold.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Right. Wait. A toast.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re just afraid to eat it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: To the artist.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s great. It’s great.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Milo, hi! How was the party?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Great! Great! Thanks for asking!</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: You calling Phil and Randy?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: I’m calling Gary.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: He’s left his office, we think he’s gone back
to the Day Care for some reason. Can you tell me why, Gary? Whatever you
say. Wants to consult with Phil. Was it Phil’s idea to run the
fingerprints?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He’s in the Day Care.</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: Bob, I’m a programmer, not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re better off not knowing.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: What’re you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They’re surveilling programmers from in here.
They steal their code. Sometimes – I know this sounds insane – sometimes
they kill one.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They let me break into 21. ’Cause there’s
nothing in there. You know they’ve been keeping things from you.
’Getting in the way when you try t’do your job. That’s why you never
told ’em your suspicions about me. Right?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: If you had I’d be dead now.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’ve been following your gut all along.
Please don’t stop now?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Who’re these guys?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: We’re too late. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: What’s in here worth taking, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: He must be out there still –</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Forget about it. His car’s not in the lot,
he’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>desi</strong>: Wanna get a cheeseburger or something?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Maybe another time.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Fellas, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave
here now.</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Wait a second. I’m the one who found out he
was mucking around in here in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: We’re all grateful for that. Really. Go out
the way you came in?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Meet me at the other location.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Tell me you’re not calling on your car
phone?!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They know, I had no choice. Get out of the
house now! Do you have a laptop?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s three years old, it –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Bring it to the other location.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But you said the other –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, alright. He’s off campus, he’s taken
some surveillance data with him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: She’s bringing her laptop, it’s wired. Second
she boots up, we’re on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-guard</strong>: Help you?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Brian here? Brian Bissel?</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-guard</strong>: Who wants to see him?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Nothing. They haven’t booted-up yet.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: This is the biggest Beta demo in like the
history of software. You’d be my partner.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You can’t pre-empt Yoga, that’s our biggest
show.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don’t you?
That’s your dream in life.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Will I get to work for Outpost?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No. But you can write your own ticket in the
Valley after this. We’re gonna bring down Outpost.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What’d they ever do for you?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy
stuff in front of the door –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Wanna be a part of history?</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-guard</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Well – would you like to pick up an extra –
232 dollars?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nothing yet, Gary…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: We’ve got a fix on ’em. 218 North Jericho
Road.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Public access TV station. KNQR.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He’s taken it to the public access
station.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: That’s what he was doing in here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gary?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five
degrees to each satellite coordinate.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gary, don’t worry, we –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Just do what I’m asking!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re interfaced with our dish.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gimme the coordinates?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Longitude 77 degrees, 03 minutes, 58 seconds
East.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Latitude 38 degrees, 55 minutes, 14 seconds
South.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: 19 seconds South. Altitude 431 Miles.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Is it your software?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Is it your dish?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Maybe it’s the satellite.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Let’s try #2.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Okay, #2.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: They’re already here. My laptop must be
wired!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We’re there.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You checked your connections?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yes! Should you reboot?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …He knows.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He’s been altering the coordinates since we
logged on. He’s a step ahead. Let’s jump to #12.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ready for number three?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Longitude 109 –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Wait… He knows.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: ’Knows I’m altering the coordinates. Let’s
jump to #12.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gary?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>gunther</strong>: Step aside. We won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Latitude 47 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Wait a second. He knows I know.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: He’s working backwards, too. Let’s do number
five?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Longitude 66.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Come now. They’ve got guns!</p>
<p><strong>gunther</strong>: Open the door, Milo!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You there yet?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: One more second.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey, hey, relax, relax!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Should I call Phil? Or do you?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Milo? Wake up. Our regular programming will
not be preempted tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gunther</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …When did you know?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You should’ve called a few times to bug me
about your job prospects.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Milo? Who’s got Skywire?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If Milo didn’t launch Skywire, who did?</p>
<p><strong>shrot</strong>: Now what are we doing? I don’t get any of
this shit!</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of
coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary’s satellite.</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: Most of us who write software
achieve our greatest work before age 30. As I grow older I know how
important it is to access fertile young minds!</p>
<p><strong>riman</strong>: You know the scenario for this.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: ’Last thing you wanna do is hurt us now.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>gunther</strong>: Who’s seeing this?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Who isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: We work hard to stay ahead
because we know any kid working in his garage can put us out of
business.</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: The first rule of the software
business is: those who don’t innovate are doomed to die.</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: That’s why we work so hard to
invent or acquire great new applications. Consumers don’t care where new
ideas come from, just so long as they’re offered at competitive prices.
Isn’t that what the free market’s about? Sure, we like being #1, but
it’s pressure, too. This business is binary: you’re a zero or a one.</p>
<p><strong>justice dept. lawyer</strong>: ’Guess we should wake the
Attorney General.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: A PC SCREEN - Teddy Chin’s recruitment
file is in one window, the hate crime footage is in another.</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: I’ve been called “aggressive” but
to me, that’s really a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: Look at all the jobs and
technologies my “aggression” has created.</p>
<p><strong>barton’s wife</strong>: Lyle? Phone for you.</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: We really are a family here at
Outpost.</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: I think that’s why outsiders
sometimes sees us as “cultish” or “secretive.”</p>
<p><strong>gary’s voice over</strong>: Is loyalty and group spirit
somehow “sinister” nowadays?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: The “murder” stuff is all innuendo: bad PR,
legally null. ’Could probably be spun as Urban Legend. There is a case
for corporate espionage, but if you cop a plea, you’ll get a slap –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Cop a plea? I’m confused, Ted. You think I
knew about this?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I’m running the company, fighting the DOJ,
raising a family. Randy and Phil obviously overreacted. To this endless,
antitrust witchhunt.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: The government’s gonna offer ’em a helluva
deal to tie you into this. Whether you knew about it or not.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer 2</strong>: Randy, Phil and whoever else knew about
it.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: That won’t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: As for PR, Skywire’ll take care of all
that.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: The world’s seen it now. They know it’s gonna
dominate the convergence market even beyond how Outpost ’98 dominates
the desktop.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Go after us, you give foreign competitors a
shot at the platform that’ll hold sway for 30 years: you threaten not
just our chip and PC partners like when you came after the browser.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You threaten TV networks, phone companies,
catalog outlets, publishing houses, movie studios, travel agents,
airlines, stock brokerages – you sabotage the whole economy. Talk about
undermining innovation!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer 2</strong>: Easy to spin, old as the hills: What’s
good for Outpost is good for America.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Come on, Bob. Load in the other disk.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: “I had no knowledge of these activities, but I
have to ask myself if the competitive environment I encouraged in some
small way contributed –”</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Gary?</p>
<p><strong>cyber pundit</strong>: The Board ousted Gary Boyd as
Chairman, they’re assisting the DOJ in the breakup of Outpost into
divisions.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: That’s gotta kill him, right?</p>
<p><strong>cyber pundit</strong>: Outpost was his baby, sure. On the
other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites.
Personally.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: Outpost doesn’t own em.</p>
<p><strong>cyber pundit</strong>: Conglomerates’re lined up to finance
the launch of the remaining satellites. They’ll pay him a huge premium
to get on-line.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: That’d change with a criminal
indictment.</p>
<p><strong>cyber pundit</strong>: There’s no hard evidence he knew about
this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to’ve vanished.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: Isn’t there a stigma? Bankrolling this
guy?</p>
<p><strong>cyber pundit</strong>: Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you
some slack in this world.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: And the kid who wrote Skywire – then
gave it away? They’re calling him the digital Robin Hood.</p>
<p><strong>cyber pundit</strong>: Milo. Surprised he’s not your
guest.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: We tried!</p>
<p><strong>cyber pundit</strong>: You better believe everybody’s trying
to sign him up.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Larry, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Your app kind of blew mine out of the
water.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We’ll come up with the next big thing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: …You wanna work – here?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Got out of my other commitment.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey, wait! Not giving everything away.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: C’mon. Bring your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You guys’ll be using Teddy’s old space, is
that okay?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Cool.</p>
