<p><strong>shooting script</strong>: September 1994</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Peter</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ben… how are you, man?</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: Nice to meet you. I think I spoke to you on
the phone a couple of years ago. Weren’t you both at MGM with
Laddie?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s right. Are you still at ICM?</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: No, I’m at Tri-Star now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s great. Say hello to Mike for me. That’s
a beautiful dress, Debbie, and those are fabulous earrings, Sheila.</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: I gotta tell you, I’m a big fan of your
writing. I loved Bay of Pigs.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thanks a lot. I didn’t actually write it, I
just got the credit. I was fired. Can I talk to you for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, Ben, I can’t help you any more. Do
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is the last time. Promise. I just need
some cash tonight. I lost my credit cards. The money’ll be on your desk
first thing tomorrow morning, Scout’s honor. How’s the new one coming
along? I here you got Richard Gere.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is all I have in cash. Please don’t
drink it here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, that’s fine. I’ll messenger it over to you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t want it. Ben… I think it would be
best if you didn’t contact me again.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: …but please, my friends, call me Yuri. It is
my American name… I picked it myself.</p>
<p><strong>first businessman</strong>: Where are you from, Yuri? I mean,
you sure don’t talk like you’re from this neck of the woods.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No… you are right, my friend. How very
observant you are. I am from Latvia.</p>
<p><strong>weird woman</strong>: Tough place.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yes, I hear this too. But I am not a tough
man. I am a simple man who is here to learn from my new American
friends.</p>
<p><strong>weird woman</strong>: Is this your friend, Yuri?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Ah, yes… Sera.</p>
<p><strong>second businessman</strong>: Of course, Yuri. I think you’ll
find this just as we discussed.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: So, my friends… I have other business to
attend. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yuri… please! Can I talk to you for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My friends… excuse me for just one moment.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I don’t want this. Yuri, please. I really
don’t want this. You know I don’t like to do groups.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I want this, Sera. I need this!</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Please, Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: These are pretty.</p>
<p><strong>8 int. room - night</strong>: Yuri and Sera - different time,
different place. Sera looking frightened, backing away from Yuri, who
pulls a switchblade from his jacket and opens it.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. penthouse - night</strong>: Yuri enters from the
bedroom. The weird woman is doing a line of coke.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sera wanted me to ask if she might undress at
once for you. She has a very beautiful undergarment witch she would like
you to see.</p>
<p><strong>weird woman</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Just look at this studio, Ben, filled with
glamorous merchandise, including an extra special prize chosen just for
You! A big, bad, BMW motorcycle, complete with saddle bags stuffed with
thousands of US dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: So, Ben, Let’s find a bar, get drunk and go
for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Then we can get a suite somewhere and order
up a case of champagne while we fuck ourselves silly.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: This is it, just for You, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Because You’ve been so patient, and because
I want to fuck you, take care of You, and because there’s nothing else
in the world worth doing.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Tell you what, Ben, let’s go to Las Vegas.
The bars stay open twenty four hours night and day. Just you, just me,
Ben, think about it, all right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You should go on that show.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, but what’s the back end like? By the time
we’re through with P and A, the above-the line is going to take it to
about fifteen and with something like this… I don’t know if Disney will
go for it… can I call you back on this? OK… chow for now. Good
morning.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ben… Mr. Simpson was looking for you. I said
that you had a doctor’s appointment. He said for you to go in as soon
as… are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m fantastic, but I gotta go out now… very
important meeting, could make a coupla million for the company.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You should go now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is to generous Peter.</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Well… we liked having you around, Ben, but
you know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sure thing… and I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Well… what are you going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I thought I might move out to Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The bars never close.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Beautiful, no just the shape which is nice, but
the whole walk, the feeling, the movement. This girl is pleased with
herself. Maybe this is the only art I can appreciate… I don’t know if
this is good or bad, but right now she is really beautiful. When I was a
boy it would have been really important that she have a pretty face, to
go with this body, I mean. I still would like to see her face, but her
beauty is no dependent on her face.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wonder what kind of panties she’s wearing.
Shit, that’s too specific, but… on the other hand, you can never be too
specific… but then, the infinitesimal must be, by definition, as
infinite as the infinite.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: God, she’s so young.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, Brad… how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking
for you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What did they look like?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Suits. I didn’t tell them anything. You know
anything about gears?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How’d this happen?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I was going real fast down on the beach and
something slipped and everything got jammed up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The news is not good, kid. This bit here… see
there… it’s broken. You need a new one.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: How much, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know. I’ll find out though.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I missed you, Sera. You have been lonely?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’m older now, Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You have been lonely?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’ve been all right.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I will keep you safe. We are both older.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You have been lonely?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I am lonely, Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yes… so am I.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I had a new dress… we were at the fair, Daddy
bought me an ice-cream and I spilt it on my dress…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: … Mom was with Helen, and Dad looked around
first to see if she was watching and then he scraped it all off and
threw it on the grass and then he kissed me and hugged me and told me it
was all right…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: This is such a small apartment, Sera. I cannot
stay here. We will find a big apartment. You know how much money I can
bring you. I belong in… … wealth and luxury.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Why did you run away from me in Los
Angeles?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Because you are sly. Mmm? You knew all along
that there was more money in Las Vegas. Didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You have nothing to fear from me. You know
why? Because we belong together, Sera. Don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m pleased with you, Sera… how you have moved
up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the
streets… and how you repay me.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Where have you been staying?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: With an old friend.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But that is none of your affair. You will call
this morning and book me into a hotel suite where I will make new
contacts for us.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You’ll need some money, then.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It is, after all, Sera, my money.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes, of course. How much do you need?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: All of it. I need to buy many things… all of
it!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Don’t look at me like that.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s not so bad. It is nothing. I need money,
Sera. I need it fast. You must go on the street tonight. For me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I need money fast, Sera. I want you back on
the street. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m Benjamin…Ben.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: I’m Teri.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll get you another one… and me too. Mind if I
join you?</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: Wow… been drinking all day?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But of course.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why don’t we finish these and go to my
apartment on the beach?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We can watch a movie and I’ll mix you up a
gooey blender drink.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: I have to get up pretty early
tomorrow. I’ll just finish this and go. Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I really wish that you’d come home with me.
You’re so cute and I’m really good in bed… believe me… you smell good
too…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, OK.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: I have to go now. Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: Maybe you shouldn’t drink so much.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe I shouldn’t breathe so much, Teri. Ha…
ha.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Time to go, buddy… We’re closing up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Would you… ?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: There’s a one-drink minimum per show, I
hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they’re supposed to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, I heard, and it’s not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What are my choices?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Everything’s ten dollars, and there’s no
alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No alcohol?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: No alcohol. You gotta get something else.
Everything’s ten dollars. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you think I should get?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Non-alcoholic malt beverage?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … Noooo.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Orange soda?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sparkling apple cider?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Water?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Water?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: One drink minimum per show. Everything’s
ten dollars. Now… tell me what you want or I’ll eighty-six you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Water.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just how much would it cost for you to
eighty-six me?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Three-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Could I have fives please? Keep one for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: To me nothing is more beautiful than the
relationship between the reflection of a woman and the woman who has
created it.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: No shit!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic girl</strong>: You wanna date? You wanna date
me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll give you a hundred dollars for a straight
forty- five minutes. You get the room.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic girl</strong>: The room is twenty. You pay for
it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: OK… but only because I think that the concept
of surrender fits in with the big picture right now. How about over
there?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I canremember… if mywifeleffme… or Illeff her…
bufuckittanyway…</p>
<p><strong>bank girl</strong>: OK… four thousand, six hundred dollars…
one moment, sir…</p>
<p><strong>bank girl</strong>: That’ll leave five dollars in your
account. Would you sign the back of the check, please?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You couldn’t cash it just like it is?</p>
<p><strong>bank girl</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well… to tell you the truth, I’m a little shaky
right now. I just had a brain surgery… Why don’t I come back after
lunch, when I’m feeling a little better? We can take care of it
then.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think, when I’m done with this, I’ll have gin
and tonic… Bombay gin and tonic.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You should be having coffee. Do you know
what time it is? You’re a young man. It’s none of my business, but if
you could see what I see, you wouldn’t do this to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I understand what you’re saying… I appreciate
your concern. Its not my intention to make you uncomfortable. Please…
serve me today and I will never come in here again. If I do, you can
eighty-six me.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Sure, sure, I can eighty-six you now if I
want to. Stop fucking with me. I don’t give a fuck what you do.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: On the house, son.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you desirable? Are you irresistible? Maybe
if you drank bourbon with me, it would help. Maybe if you kissed me and
I could taste the sting in your mouth, it would help.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If you drank bourbon with me naked… if you
smelled of bourbon as you fucked me, it would help… it would increase my
esteem for you. If you poured bourbon on to your naked body and said to
me… drink this…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … if you spread your legs and had bourbon
dripping from your breasts and you vagina and said drink here… then I
could fall in love with you, because then I would have a purpose, to
clean you up, and that would prove that I’m worth something. Id lick you
clean so you could go away and fuck someone else.</p>
<p><strong>bank girl</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m back, I’ve got my check… and baby… I’m
ready to sign.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There… Steady as a fucking rock, excuse my
French. Wanna have dinner with me?</p>
<p><strong>bank girl</strong>: I’m glad you’re feeling better. Do you
need a validation?</p>
<p><strong>54 int. doctor’s office - day</strong>: Improvised scene.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: All rooms to be paid a week in advance,
maid service is optional, use of the pool is at your own risk, there is
no lifeguard on duty.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. doctor’s office - day</strong>: Improvised scene.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you working?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Working? What do you mean, working? I’m
walking.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Isn’t it illegal to drink and drive?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s funny. I wonder if you’ll take two
hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That is, if you’ll come to my room for an hour,
I will give you five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Maybe you shouldn’t stand in the road like
that. You’re pretty drunk.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You’re pretty drunk.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not really. My room’s not far. The Whole Year
Inn. You can drive with me if you want…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … or we can walk… or I’ll give you cab
fare.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Why don’t you give me the money when I’m in
the car, and I’ll drive you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m Ben.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’m Sera.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sarah - with an H?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: No - S.E.R.A.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You wanna start the engine?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’m sort of curious… if you’re willing to pay
me two- fifty… not that I mind… I mean, I’m OK with that - why aren’t
you staying in a hotel?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We can go to one if you’d prefer.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: No, this is fine. I was just wondering.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well… I’m here because I’m a drunk who tends to
pass out at odd hours for unpredictable stretches. I’m going to a hotel
soon. A room with a balcony to pass out on… or off.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you
want. But I really have to go then. It’s your time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right, I’ll get your door. I tend to fade in
and out lately.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I guess I do too.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I sometimes fade out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh… well, maybe we better synchronize our
spells… or stagger them.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You were going to get my door.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: What this room needs… is more booze.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Mind if I use the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Want a drink? I’m having one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: For two-fifty we can do pretty much what you
want. You’ve been drinking, so it might be better if I got on top, but
the other way’s fine too. I have some jelly in case you want to fuck my
ass, that’s up to you. If you want to come in my face, that’s OK too,
just try to keep it out of my hair, I just washed it… and my eyes, it
stings.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Do you want to fuck now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe another drink first. More tequila?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: OK… whatever.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: What’s the story? Are you too drunk to
come?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t care about that. There’s time left. You
can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen.
Just stay, that’s all I want.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: So, Ben, what brings you to Las Vegas?
Business convention?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I came here to drink… myself… you know…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: To death?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card,
gonna sell the car tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: How long’s it gonna take, for you to drink
yourself to death?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think about four weeks, and I’ve got enough
for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes… that should do it. What am I? A
luxury?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah. And your meter just ran out.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: It’s OK… nice watch. Go on. Talk some
more.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: In LA I kept running out of booze and the store
would be closed because I’d forget to look at my watch… so I decided to
move here because nothing ever closes and because I got tired of getting
funny looks when I would walk into a bar at six o’clock… even the
bartenders started preaching. Here, everyone’s from out of town so no
one cares, no one is overtly fucking up</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a
few drinks.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: A full night on the street and this is
all?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Like I said… it was a slow night… I’m sorry.
It was hard to score.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Don’t hit me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What do you think… you are sixteen years old
on Hollywood Boulevard?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Maybe nobody wants to fuck a chick with a cut
on her cheek.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: There, go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I could kill you. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Work, tonight, bring me money, no matter the
hour.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I will Yuri. I will.</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer</strong>: About ready for another drink?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the
convention?</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer</strong>: Do I look that obvious? My name’s
Paul.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: No, of course not, just a wild guess. I’m Sera
and that’s a margarita.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: So… are you alone, or are you just using me to
make someone else jealous?</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer</strong>: Alone. Alone. I’m here alone.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Where are you staying?</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer</strong>: Right here at the hotel. Why?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Well… I thought you might be looking for a
date.</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer</strong>: A date. What, are you a hooker? What
do you mean a date? I’ve got a wife back home. I just came over to talk
for a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’m sorry, I guess I misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Please don’t raise your voice. I won’t bother
you about it again.</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer</strong>: Sorry. Look… you seem like a nice
girl. I’m just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer</strong>: Here, have another drink. I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Maybe you should give it a miss for this
evening.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I couldn’t remember what happened last time. I
was afraid that I might have been rude, or mean to you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If I was I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: No, just drunk… but that’s OK. Where’s your
car?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I sold it this morning. I’m going to take cabs
from now on in.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t run away.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Why should I? I know you’re not a cop, so what
is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was looking for you tonight. I don’t know if
you have a boyfriend…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … or a girlfriend, but if you have some free
time… maybe we could have dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Are you serious.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think you know I’m serious. I’ll pay you if
you like… but I’d like to see you.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: No, I can’t have dinner with you.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: The Mojave Hotel, please.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: It’s me, Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sera! It’s…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: … it’s late.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Sorry, Yuri… good night… lots of tricks… I
think things are picking up.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Have you told anyone that I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Do you here that?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: They’re talking about me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Go, Sera. Go. Stay at home. I will call you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yuri… are you…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sera… please go.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: This is very important… and I must listen. Now
go.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Goodbye, Sera. Don’t come back here. I will
not see you again.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No thanks… I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Still want to have dinner?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I have to change and take a shower first. If
you want to come home and wait.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the
way. I owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is the home of an angel.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. Take your time. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course. Wow… you look extremely
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Thank you. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t know. My watch went the way of the
car.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m rambling. I really like you. You make me
want to talk… I don’t know what time it is.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I like hearing you talk. If you feel up to a
short walk, there’s a place to eat around the corner. All the food in
Vegas is terrible so the place doesn’t really matter. How does that
sound to you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do they have drinks?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’m from the East. I went to college, did an
arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here
deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I’ll come back
to that later. The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the
bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my
life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a
drunk?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is that really what you want to ask me?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, then I guess this is our first date… or
our last. Until now, I wasn’t sure it was either.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Very clever.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: First. It’s our first. I’m just concerned. So…
why are you killing yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Interesting choice of words. I don’t remember.
I just know that I want to.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that
you’re drinking as a way to kill yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Or killing myself as a way to drink.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’ll talk about it some other time maybe.
OK?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What are you thinking? Are you angry with
me?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Ben, why don’t you stay at my place tonight? I
mean… look, you’re so drunk. I like you. I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s astonishing. Sera, look…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I
mean…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Let’s face it, what the fuck are you doing in
Las Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if
it’ll make you feel better. Let’s talk about tomorrow. Wanna do
something?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Sure… tonight. Then please stay at my
place.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera… you know I’m not much good in the
sack.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: It’s not about sex, Ben. I’ll make you up a
bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till
late. As you know, I am my own boss.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How long have I been her?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Three nights, two days. When is your rent
coming up at the motel?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know. I’ll go and sort it out today.
Why don’t you come?… We’ll find a real room for me. You can pick it out,
a tower on the strip.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: There’s no reason to blow all your money on a
hotel room.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: What I mean is that you should bring your
stuff over here. We’re spending all this time together… what the
fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Let’s face it, Ben, we’re having fun here.
I’ve never done so much talking in my life.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: So! Let’s dispense with the formalities. I
want you here… now!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera you are crazy.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: So… I’m not too concerned with long term
plans.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t you think you’ll get a little bored
living with a drunk?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: That is what I want. Why don’t you go and get
your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You haven’t seen the worst of it. These last
few days I’ve been very controlled. I knock things over… I throw up all
the time. Now I feel really good… You’re like some kind of antidote that
mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won’t last forever.
You’ll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: OK, you go back to your hotel and I’ll go back
to my glamorous life of being alone.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: The only thing I have to come home to is a
bottle of Listerine to wash the taste of come out of my mouth. I’m tired
of being alone… that’s what I’m tired of.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Don’t you like me, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t be silly?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: We gotta decide this… right now. Before we go
any further. You either stay here with me or…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: … we can’t see each other any more.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera… what you don’t understand is…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You can never… never… ask me to stop drinking.
Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I do. I really do. OK. I have to do some
shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your
things. Don’t hurry and I’ll be back before you to let you in.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe this isn’t a good idea after all.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen, angel… the thing is that I’m nuts about
you and this is a bad thing… because my real plan is to die here and you
were never even part of my plan… but like I said, I’m nuts about you…
wait a minute, I have an idea, angel.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: We didn’t know whether to call the police
or not.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: He’s been there for about half an hour. My
husband thought he’d seen you two together, but I thought it best to
wait until you got home.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes, he’s my friend. I guess he just had a
little too much to drink. I’ll help him inside. Thanks for the concern.
Sorry to trouble you.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Well, call me if there’s anything I can
do.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Can you wake up?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Why don’t you go in and sit down. I have some
gifts for you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right… OK…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Don’t worry… I got’em.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Seriously, Ben… I need to keep pretty low-key
around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That
was the landlord.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Gift number one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I used to carry a lot of keys, but one by one
they all fell victim to the great condensation. Now I have just this
one… which is…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was miles away.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ah… more gifts. I have to sit down for
this.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera, I love that name… S.E.R.A. Before we
proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve come this far… here I am, in your house. I
want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because… it’s better for me that way. OK?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Well… OK…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera… I hope that you understand how I feel
about this. First of all, you’re welcome to my money. We can buy a
couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don’t think
you’re talking to me right now about money.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. I think you’re talking about you. I’ll tell
you right now that I’m in love with you… but, be that as it may, I’m not
here to force my twisted life into your soul.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I know that…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … and I’m not here to demand your attention to
the point where it changes your life. We know I’m a drunk… but that
seems to be all right with you. And I know that you’re a hooker. I hope
you understand that I’m a person who is totally at ease with this… which
is not to say that I’m indifferent or that I don’t care… I do… it simply
means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I’m saying is… that I
hope you understand that I understand.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about
how that would be… but now I’m not. And you should know that included
with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ah, yes… I suppose sooner or later we ought to
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Whatever that means. Open your presents.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Open this one first.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This should work very nicely with my suit,
which, by the way, is the only item of clothing I brought over from the
motel with me.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Right… the suitcase was clinking. So what did
you do with your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I threw them into the garbage., which was
perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I
thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty-five
pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the
hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting
words fall from your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Now, try this one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well… looks like I’m with the right girl.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I must say that I’m very impressed that you
would buy this for me. I know you wouldn’t do this without thinking
about it. Funny… you did just what I would have done.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m going to fill it right now.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could
go out and play for a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I hadn’t planned to gamble… but if you would
keep the bulk of my money here, then I could safely blow a couple of
hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Giving you money makes me want to come.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Then come. I’m going to change. Watch TV. I’ll
be half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I am planning to go out and do some work.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I like your earrings.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I like women who wear mismatched earrings.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Well, then… I hope we don’t run into any
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just
because I fuck for money doesn’t give you cause to start picking up
women and leaving me looking silly.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And I only have eyes for you. And we both know
that you would never become romantically involved with a trick,
right?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Very well… umm… I never expected to have to ask
you this again… but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the
casino… I remember kissing you… that was really nice but everything
after that is a blank.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Well - I was prepared for worse, but it wasn’t
so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed
just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but
then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and
then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool
into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a
real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, and what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I tried to shut you up and help you to your
feet but you kept swinging at me - not like you wanted to hit me, but
more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you
stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the
street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s impressive. How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I told them you were an alcoholic and T would
take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there
again.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes, we.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What happened then?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You were OK for a while, so we walked for
about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I
think even you knew that wasn’t going to happen. We got a cab and you
asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had
plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to
keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you
did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I
covered you up and came to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I warned you… … but I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Here’s my speech… … I know this shouldn’t be
acceptable to m, but it is. Don’t ask me why. I sense that your trouble
is very big… and I’m scared for you… and so I’m doing what I think you
need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn’t
bother me. It has nothing to do with us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s amazing. What are you? Some sort of
angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so
good?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I don’t know what you’re saying. I’m just
using you. I need you. Can we not talk about it any more, please. Not
another word.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why don’t you go back to sleep. I’ll go out and
buy us some breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Ben, I’m working tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A beer and a double kamikaze please.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Sure thing. Anything to eat?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not quite yet. First I have to drink myself
sober, then… a few crackers, maybe an egg and toast…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … then I’ll go home with the groceries and
we’ll have breakfast together, and that’ll make her feel better about my
condition…</p>
<p><strong>biker girl</strong>: Who the fuck are you talking to, Mr? Why
are you all dressed up, honey? My, don’t you look fine.</p>
<p><strong>biker girl</strong>: I am very bored with my date. Would you
like to buy me a drink?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you mind if I buy her a drink?</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Fuck her. I don’t care what the fuck you do
with her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe I could buy you both a drink?</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Fuck you. Don’t fuck with me, motherfucker.
Fuck off. Go to it, she’s waiting for her drink.</p>
<p><strong>biker girl</strong>: See what an asshole he is. I’ll have a
rum and Coke.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Barman? A rum and Coke, please.</p>
<p><strong>biker girl</strong>: Can I stay with you for a while?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean move in with me? Isn’t this a bit
sudden?</p>
<p><strong>biker girl</strong>: Oh, I don’t have a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t think my wife would dig it too
much.</p>
<p><strong>biker girl</strong>: Maybe we could just go find a room and
fuck all day. You wouldn’t have to tell your wife about that, would you?
I could suck you like this.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: See, the thing is… fucking you would be
wonderful, but I am deeply in love with Sera…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … and it’s almost impossible for me to imagine
being with someone else…</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Now listen, asshole, I’m not gonna just sit
around and watch her suck on your ear.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Now, I know that she came over to you, like
she does, so I’m gonna pretend that you’re innocent and give you one
chance to walk out of this place… right now.</p>
<p><strong>biker girl</strong>: Get lost, jerk.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry… but she and I have decided to spend
a few hours together in a mo -</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’re quite a fighter.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: This may sound silly, but I’m going to
have to ask you to leave. It’s what we do around here when there’s a
fight. Men’s room is around the back.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Oh, no! Oh, fuck, Ben, look at your face. You
get in a fight? I thought you didn’t fight. Goddammit. How do you feel?
Wait here. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Did you say something stupid to someone
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Absolutely not… ow… I was defending the honor
of some poor wayward maiden.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Why don’t you go and finish this in the
bathroom. Take a shower and put on your other shirt. I’ll fix breakfast
and then we’ll go shopping and get some new clothes. I think this suit
must be unlucky.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow
tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: OK, but remember that they wear it because they
have to. I wear it because I want to. That’ll make me look different.
Let’s get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There was no time for me to write a card, with
you breathing down my neck all day., so you’ll just have to wing it,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Your color.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think you should wear one at a time. One of
these… and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but
I didn’t think it would fly… as a gift, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’ll wear them tonight… one of them.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes… tonight. Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ll be able to feel it, sharp and hot under
your ear, as one of the brothers is driving your head, face down into
one of the penthouse pillows.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Ben, wait… please wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Maybe you should wait for her, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Because… you can hear in her voice that she
really wants you to.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can we just forget it?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I don’t understand any of that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can we just ignore it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes… I’ll give you that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you, Sera.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Do you want me not to go tonight?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No… we already talked about that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of
your tricks what it’s like to sleep with you.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: They wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Maybe you should ask me sometime. I’d be happy
to show you.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’ll be back home around three. If you’re back
by then we can watch TV or something… I guess what I’m saying is… that I
hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You be careful to. I’m going to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Shall we go away for a couple of days?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah… I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Don’t do that to me. Don’t frighten me like
that.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset
and Western. The guy was polite and didn’t argue about the price. He
parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with.
A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the
twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children
playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room.
The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I
put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and
then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on
the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of
guilty because he hadn’t come and I offered to reason with the woman and
get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began
dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and… hugged
me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and
went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn’t have to
work again that evening.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Last spring I happened to walk past a house
that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the
ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have
been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me
because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late
for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it
and my memory and… the reason I’m telling you this epilogue is that I
felt that I’d come full circle.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Where was that house? The one in LA, I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if
you ever clipped her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I like it here with you.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Let’s stay for a while.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’ve missed the best sun. Why did you have to
pawn your watch?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t know I’d ever need it again.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Take this off.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Maybe we should go inside. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll go and clean up. Perhaps you could take
care of this.</p>
<p><strong>desk-clerk</strong>: Everybody OK?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Yes, fine. Don’t worry. We’ll pay for the
chair, and I’ll clean all this up, the pool too.</p>
<p><strong>desk-clerk</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You seem prepared for accidents.</p>
<p><strong>desk-clerk</strong>: Yeah… we get a lot of screw- ups
here.</p>
<p><strong>desk-clerk</strong>: Now, you two keep you loud talk and your
liquor to your room. Check out first thing tomorrow and after that I
don’t want to see either of you here again. I don’t need you paying for
the chair or cutting your pretty hands on the glass. Let’s leave it at
that.</p>
<p><strong>desk-clerk</strong>: See ya in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’m in here. You probably don’t want to hear
about it right now, but I bought some plain rice. I thought it might be
something you could eat. So if you get hungry later on, just let me
know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think I’m ready for the rice!</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: You’re pretty sick.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I want you to go see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sera… I’m not going to see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe it’s time I moved to a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: And do what… rot away in a room? We’re not
going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You’re
staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Will you lighten up, please?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: One thing… one thing… this is one thing you
can do for me. I’ve given you gallons of free will here! You can do this
for me.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Let’s face it. Sick as you are, I’m probably
the only thing that’s keeping you alive.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I have to go to work now.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Hey… that was quite a play. You in for the
convention?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d like to fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: I’m very expensive.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How much to lick your pussy?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: There are limits.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes… I guess I knew that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Perhaps I could crash on the couch for a few
hours… and then I’ll leave.</p>
<p><strong>tallest college boy</strong>: How much will it cost us to
fuck you?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Sorry, guys, but I don’t know what you mean.
Anyway, I never date more than one guy at a time.</p>
<p><strong>smallest college boy</strong>: Come on… we got money… show
her the money.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: How much of that money did you guys want to
spend?</p>
<p><strong>tallest college boy</strong>: How much you want? How about
two hundred for an hour?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Don’t your friends talk? Try three-hundred for
a half hour.</p>
<p><strong>other college boy</strong>: Three hundred for the hour.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: OK… three… and we’ll see how it goes. Where
are you staying?</p>
<p><strong>tallest college boy</strong>: The Yukon, room
twenty-four.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: I’ll see you there in fifteen minutes. You can
pay me then. Why don’t you all take a shower while you’re waiting.</p>
<p><strong>other college boy</strong>: A shower? In fifteen minutes?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Look… I’ll only need one of you at a time.
RIGHT? UNDERSTOOD? So… the other two can shower while I’m there. OK?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Where are the boys this weekend, Frank? Why,
hell, Charlie, I sent ’em off to learn the one thing I couldn’t teach
’em.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: OK… where’s the bedroom, and who’s first?</p>
<p><strong>smallest college boy</strong>: I want to fuck her in the
butt…</p>
<p><strong>smallest college boy</strong>: … you too, right?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Forget that. No one’s doing that. You’ll all
go one at a time. I f you want I’ll suck you instead, but that’s all.
Then I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>smallest college boy</strong>: You said I could fuck her in
the butt.</p>
<p><strong>other college boy</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: That’s it… Take your money back. I’m
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>smallest college boy</strong>: No… don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Maybe you’d like to fuck one of your friends
in the butt instead.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Hey… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Go on… fuck her ass…</p>
<p><strong>other voice</strong>: Look at me… look at me… look at me.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: What’s the matter, honey, get a
back-door delivery you weren’t expecting? You gonna be able to pay the
fare?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Oh, don’t wanna talk to me, unh? Well,
don’t take it out on me, I’m just covering my ass. What the hell do you
expect, stuttin’ around like that… dressed like that? You oughta be glad
the creep didn’t nail ya.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: I’m sorry… but we’d like you out by the
end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, ma’am. He never checked back
in.</p>
<p><strong>stetson man</strong>: What’s the problem, honey?… You on
strike?</p>
<p><strong>139 int. doctor’s office - day</strong>: Improvised
scene.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Let go. What’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: We don’t want you in here, that’s
the problem. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Don’t worry… If you don’t want me in here,
then I don’t want to be in here. Just let go of my arm and I’ll walk out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Yeah… we’ll both walk out now.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Next time it won’t be so fucking
easy.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Hello… hello… Ben? Where the fuck are you?
Give me the address.</p>
<p><strong>black driver</strong>: What in the hell happened to you,
Miss?</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Oh… it was an argument.</p>
<p><strong>black driver</strong>: Leave him, Miss. Pretty girl like You
could get any man that You wanted.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Ben… I’ve been looking for You. Have You been
here since You left? It smells bad in here. It’s so dark.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wanted to see you…</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Oh, Ben… you look so very sick… my love…
