id="star-wars-attack-of-the-clones">star-wars-attack-of-the-clones</h1>
<p><strong>ext. space</strong>: A vast sea of stars severas as a
backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into
infinity.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cityscape, coruscant - dawn</strong>: The ships skim
across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome
hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the
buildings of the capital planet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coruscant, landing platform - dawn</strong>: Two Naboo
Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The
Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on
the remaining plaform.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Cord�…</p>
<p><strong>cord�</strong>: … I’m sorry, m’lady… I’m… not sure I…</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: No!… No!… No!…</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I should not have come back.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: M’Lady, you are still in danger.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: This vote is very important. You did
your duty and Cord� did hers. Now come. M’Lady, please!</p>
<p><strong>ext. senate building - day</strong>: The massive Senate
Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still
to burn off.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate chamber - day</strong>: The vast rotunda is
buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor’s majordomo,
tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN,
riding a small one man floating scooter.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Order! We shall have order! The motion
for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what
we will vote on at this time.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: …My esteemed colleagues, excuse me… I
have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of
the Naboo system… Has been assassinated!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: This grievous blow is especially personal
to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen.
She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this
honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she
could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service,
and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us
all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom… and as a
dear friend.</p>
<p><strong>senator ask aak</strong>: How many more Senators will die
before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and
they need an army to do it.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador darsana</strong>: Why weren’t the Jedi able to
stop this assassination? We are no longer safe, under their
protection.</p>
<p><strong>orn free taa</strong>: The Republic needs more security now!
Before it comes to war.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Must I remind the Senator from Malastare
that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our
objective here… not war.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: My noble colleagues, I concur with the
Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: It is with great surprise and joy the
chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padm� Amidala.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Less than an hour ago, an assassination
attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others
were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more
importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target.
I have led the opposition to build an army… but there is someone in this
body who will stop at nothing to assure it’s passage…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I warn you, if you vote to create this army,
war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do
not wish to do it again.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Wake up, Senators… you must wake up! If you
offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in
return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This
decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great
Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous
decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a
declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they
do.</p>
<p><strong>orn free taa</strong>: My motion to defer the vote must be
dealt with first. That is the rule of law.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Due to the lateness of the hour and the
seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow.
Until then, the Senate stands adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>ext. executive quarters building - day</strong>: The giant
towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens.
Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.</p>
<p><strong>int. chancellor’s office - day</strong>: CHANCELLOR PALPATINE
sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of
the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from
him.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I don’t know how much longer I can hold
off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the
separatists.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: If they do break away -</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: No! I will not let that happen!</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: But if they do, you must realise there
aren’t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Master Yoda, do you think it will really
come to war?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Worse than war, I fear… Much worse.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: What do you sense, Master?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Impossible to see … The Dark Side clouds
everything. But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will.</p>
<p><strong>dar wac</strong>: The loyalist committee has arrived, my
Lord.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Send them in.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: With you the force is strong… young Senator.
To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea
who was behind the attack?</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I don’t wish to disagree but I think that
Count Dooku was behind it.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: You know, M’Lady, Count Dooku was once a
Jedi. He wouldn’t assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.</p>
<p><strong>ki-adi-mundi</strong>: He is a political idealist, not a
murderer.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: In dark times nothing is what it appears to
be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Count Dooku has always avoided any kind
of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he
kill you? To what end?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I don’t know, but everything in my being
tells me he was behind it…</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Master Jedi, may I suggest that the
Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Do you think that is a wise use of
manpower during these stressful times?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not
believe the…</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: …“situation is that serious.” No, but I
do, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Chancellor, please! I don’t want any more
guards!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I realise all too well that additional
security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are
familiar with… an old friend like… Master Kenobi…</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: That’s possible. He has just returned
from a Border dispute on Ansion.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You must remember him, M’Lady… he watched
over you during the blockade conflict.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: This is not necessary, Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Do it for me, M’Lady, please. I will rest
easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is
unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: I will have Obi-Wan report to you
immediately, M’Lady.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Too little about yourself you worry, Senator,
and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padm�. Accept
our help.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I will not like this Republiv, that has
stood for over a thousand years, be split in two</p>
<p><strong>ext. senate apartments - twilight</strong>: A graceful
skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, apartment corridor - evening</strong>:
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor,
where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and
becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see’en
yousa. Wahoooooo!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me,
Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have
had to learn Diplodiaclect… speak it like a native now. Don’t really see
the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it…</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: …and this, I take it, is your apprentice…
Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? Nooooooo! Yousa so
biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hi, Jar Jar.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, apartment - evening</strong>: PADME is
in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room,
followed by the TWO JEDI.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Lookie… lookie… Oops!… Oh, dear, I’m afraid
I’ve forgotten myself again.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s a great pleasure to see you again,
M’Lady.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I’m
so glad our paths have crossed again… but I must warn you that I think
your presence here is unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m sure the Jedi Council have their
reasons.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Annie?? My goodness you’ve grown.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: So have you… grown more beautiful, I mean…
and much shorter… for a Senator, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Oh Annie, you’ll always be that little boy I
knew on Tatooine.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Our presence will be invisible, M’Lady.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: I am very grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will
admit.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I don’t need more security, I need answers. I
want to know who is trying to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We’re here to protect you Senator, not to
start an investigation.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We will find out who is trying to kill you
Padm�, I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We are not going to exceed our mandate, my
young Padawan learner.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I meant in the interest of protecting her,
Master, of course.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We are not going through this exercise
again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What??!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Why else do you think we were assigned to
her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security…
not Jedi. It’s overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our
mandate.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We will do as the Council has instructed,
and you will learn your place, young one.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Perhaps with merely your presence, the
mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now if you will
excuse me I will retire.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: Well, I know I feel a lot better
having you here. I’ll have an officer on every floor and I’ll be at the
command centre downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa
again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: She didn’t even recognise me, Jar Jar. I
thought about her every day since we parted… and she’s forgotten me
completely.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in
longo time.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, you’re focusing on the Negative
again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets
check the security here.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, my master.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jedi temple - evening</strong>: The vast Jedi Temple
sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the
traffic-filled sky.</p>
<p><strong>int. jedi temple, corridor - evening</strong>: MACE WINDU and
YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the
end.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Why couldn’t we see this attack on the
Senator?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Masking the future, is this disturbance in the
Force.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: The propecy is coming true, the Dark
Side is growing.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: And only those who have turned to the Dark
Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the
Dark Side can we see.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: It’s been ten years, and the Sith still
have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: …Out there, they are. A certainty that is.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Do you think Obi-Wan’s apprentice will
be able to bring balance to the Force?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, amidala’s apartment, bedroom -
night</strong>: PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the
city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the
corner of the bedroom. His power is off.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, amidala’s apartment, main r0om -
night</strong>: ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a
meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor
outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN’S eyes pop open. His eyes dart
around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it
back in his belt.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Captain Typho has more than enough men
downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Quiet as a tomb. I don’t like just waiting
here for something to happen to her.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: She covered that camera. I don’t think she
liked me watching her.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What is she thinking?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: She programmed Artoo to warn us if there’s
an intruder.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s not an intruder I’m worried about.
There are many other ways to kill a Senator.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know, but we also want to catch this
assassin. Don’t we, Master?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You’re using her as bait??</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It was her idea… No harm will come to her. I
can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s too risky… and your senses aren’t that
attuned, young apprentice.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: And yours are?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, amidala’s apartment, bedroom -
night</strong>: As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her
window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window,
creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm
cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small
section of glass is removed from the window.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, amidala’s apartment, main room -
night</strong>: ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the
main room of the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You look tired.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t sleep well, anymore.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Because of your mother?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t know why I keep dreaming About her
now. I haven’t seen her since I was little.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Dreams pass in time.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’d rather dream of Padm�. Just Being around
her again is… intoxicating.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray
you. You’ve made a commitment to the Jedi order… a commitment not easily
broken… and don’t forget she’s a politician. They’re not to be
trusted.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: She’s not like the others in the Senate,
Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s been my experience that Senators are
only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns… and they are
more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those
funds.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Not another lecture, Master. Not on the
economics of politics…. It’s too early in the morning… and besides,
you’re generalising. The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be corrupt.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Palpatine’s a politician, I’ve observed
that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the
Senators.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I think he is a good man. My instincts are
very positive about…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I sense it, too.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, amidala’s apartment, bedroom -
night</strong>: ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE
KOUHUNS are inches from PADME’S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked
stinger tongues flick out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. window ledge, apartment building - night</strong>:
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE
DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE
DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and
fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories
above the city.</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, amidala’s apartment - night</strong>:
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the
DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Stay here!</p>
<p><strong>ext. cityscape, coruscant - night</strong>: The PROBE DROID
sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing
OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder
traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power
shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the
error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID’S systems
light up again and it takes off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. senate apartments - entrance - night</strong>: ANAKIN
charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He
vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines
of speeder traffic high above.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cityscape, coruscant - night</strong>: The DROID bumps
against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a
speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between
buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to
lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a
dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty
stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter
called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she
pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI.
EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That was wacky! I almost lost you in the
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Oh, you know, Master, I couldn’t find a
speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit… and with the right speed
capabilities… and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: If you’d spend as much time working on your
saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival
Master Yoda as a swordsman.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I thought I already did.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Only in your mind, my very young
apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, I forgot you don’t like flying,
Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I don’t mind flying… but what you’re doing
is suicide!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master, you know I’ve been flying since
before I could walk. I’m very good at this.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Just slow down!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Wait! Don’t go in there!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You know I don’t like it when you do
that!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, Master. Don’t worry, this guy’s gonna
kill himself any minute now!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What are you doing? He’s gonna blast
me!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Right - this isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: That was too close!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Clear that!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Clear the flag! We’re losing power!
Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Whooooaaa! Don’t do that! I don’t like it
when you do that!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: So sorry, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s dangerous near those power couplings!
Slow down! Don’t go through there!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yiiii, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, Master!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh, that was good…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: That was crazy!!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Ahh, damn.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Stop!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, we can make it.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m crazy… I’m crazy… I’m crazy.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: But it worked… we made it.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It didn’t work… we’ve stalled! And you
almost got us killed!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I think we’re still alive.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It was stupid!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I could have made it…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: But you didn’t!!! And now we’ve lost
him.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No we didn�t…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Where are you going?! He went down there,
the other way.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: This is a shortcut… I think.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What do you mean, �You think?� What kind of
shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You�ve lost him!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master, if we keep this chase going, that
creep�s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I�d very much like to find
out who in the hell he is and who he�s working for…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh, so that�s why we�re going in the wrong
direction.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Well, you lost him.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I�m deeply sorry, Master.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Excuse me for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>ext. entertainment street - night</strong>: ZAM exits the
crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and
runs down the very crowded street.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: She went into that club, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Patience.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Here. Next time try not to lose it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: A Jedi’s saber is his most precious
possession.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He must keep it with him at all times.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: This weapon is your life!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve heard this lesson before…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: But, you haven’t learned anything,
Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I try, Master.</p>
<p><strong>int. nightclub - night</strong>: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the
nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Why do I think you are going to be the
death of me?!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t say that Master… You’re the closest
thing I have to a father… I love you. I don’t want to cause you
pain.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Then why don’t you listen to me?!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I will. I’ll do better, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Do you see him him?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I think he’s a she…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Then be extra careful… Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Where are you going, Master?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: To get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>elan sleazebaggano</strong>: Wanna buy some death sticks?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You don’t want to sell me death-
sticks.</p>
<p><strong>elan</strong>: I don’t want to sell you death- sticks.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You want to go home and rethink your
life.</p>
<p><strong>elan</strong>: I want to go home and rethink my life.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Easy… Official business. Go back to your
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley outside nightclub - night</strong>: OBI-WAN and
ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN
attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She
winces in pain, then nods.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Do you know who it was you were trying to
kill?</p>
<p><strong>zam wessel</strong>: The Senator from Naboo.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Who hired you?</p>
<p><strong>zam wessel</strong>: It was just a job.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Tell us!</p>
<p><strong>zam wessel</strong>: That Senator’s gonna die soon anyway,
and the next one won’t make the same mistake I did…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: This wound’s going to need treatment.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Who hired you? Tell us… tell us now!</p>
<p><strong>zam</strong>: It was a Bounty Hunter called…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Toxic Dart…</p>
<p><strong>int. senate building, amidala’s apartment - day</strong>:
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME’S
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Representative Binks. I know I can count on
you.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Yousa betchen mesa bottums.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am
honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with
deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. It is not every day
that I am called upon to…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You’re a good friend, Jar Jar. I don’t wish
to hold you up. I’m sure you have a great deal to do.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Of course, M’lady.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I do not like this idea of hiding.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t worry. Now that the Council has
ordered an investigation, it won’t take Master Obi-Wan long to find that
bounty hunter.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I haven’t worked for a year to defeat the
“Military Creation Act” not to be here when its fate is decided.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and
do what is requested of us.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Pride?!? Annie, you’re young, and you don’t
have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions
for some other time.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, M’lady. I was only trying to…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Annie! No!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Please don’t call me that.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Annie…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I’ve always called you that… it is your name,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It’s Anakin. When you say Annie it’s like
I’m still a little boy… and I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I’m sorry, Anakin. It’s impossible to deny
you’ve… …that you’ve grown up.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Mentors have a way of seeing more of our
faults than we would like. It’s the only way we grow.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t get me wrong… Obi-Wan is a great
mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am
truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only… although I’m a Padawan
learner, in some ways… a lot of ways… I’m ahead of him. I’m ready for
the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I’m too
unpredictable… Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made
it… I know I started my training late… but he won’t let me move on.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: That must be frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It’s worse… he’s overly critical. He never
listens! He just doesn’t understand! It’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I’m sorry… You sounded exactly like that
little boy I once knew, when he didn’t get his way.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not whining! I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I didn’t say it to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Don’t try to grow up too fast.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I am grown up. You said it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Please don’t look at me like that.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Because I can see what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Ahh… so, you have Jedi powers too?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: It makes me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, M’lady.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coruscant, spaceport freighter docks, transport bus -
day</strong>: A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of
Coruscant’s Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity.
Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant
floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge
intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an
overhang.</p>
<p><strong>int. coruscant, spaceport freighter docks, transport bus -
day</strong>: ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get
up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are
waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like
Senator Amidala.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: Be safe, m’lady.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme…
the threat’s on you two now.</p>
<p><strong>dorme</strong>: He’ll be safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>dorme</strong>: It’s not me, M’Lady. I worry about you. What
if they realise I’m not you?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how
grown up he is.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not
attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me
or the Council.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I will get to the bottom of this plot
quickly, M’Lady. You’ll be back here in no time.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I will be most grateful for your speed,
Master Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: May the Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: May the Force be with you, Master.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Suddenly, I’m afraid…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m kinda scared too. This is my first
assignment on my own.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: There’s nothing to worry about… we have Artoo
with us.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I hope he doesn’t try anything foolish.</p>
<p><strong>captain typho</strong>: I’d be more concerned about her doing
something, than him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. freighter docks - coruscant - day</strong>: The
freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It
soon moves into the crowded skies.</p>
<p><strong>int. jedi temple, main hallway - late day</strong>: From high
above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the
floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.</p>
<p><strong>int. jedi temple, analysis cubicles - late day</strong>:
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He
comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4
ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.</p>
<p><strong>pk-4</strong>: Place the subject for analysis on the sensot
tray, please.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s a toxic dart. I need to know where it
came from and who made it.</p>
<p><strong>pk-4</strong>: One moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>pk-4</strong>: As you can see on your screen, subject weapon
does not exist in any known culture. Markings cannot be identified.
Probablt self-made by a warrior not associated with any known
society.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Excuse me? Could you try again please?</p>
<p><strong>pk-4</strong>: Master Jedi, our records are very thorough.
they cover eight percent of the galaxy. If I can’t tell you where it
came from, nobody can.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Thanks for your assistance! You may not be
able to figure this out, but I think I know someone who might.</p>
<p><strong>ext. space, starship freighter</strong>: The massive,
slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.</p>
<p><strong>int. starfreighter, storage hold - day</strong>: The great,
gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side
ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling
out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.</p>
<p><strong>server</strong>: Keep moving! Keep moving!</p>
<p><strong>food server</strong>: Hey! No Droids!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, no, Mom, no…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You seemed to be having a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: We went into lightspeed a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I’ve
thought about it every day since I left. It’s by far the most beautiful
place I’ve ever seen…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You were just a little boy then. It may not
be as you remember it; time changes your perception.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I think time has given me much more mature
feelings to enhance my perception.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: It must be difficult having sworn your life
to the Jedi… not being able to visit the places you like… or do the
things you like…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Or be with the people I love.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Are you allowed to love? I thought that was
forbidden for a Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Attachment is forbidden. Possession is
forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is
central to a Jedi’s life, so you might say we’re encouraged to love.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You have changed so much</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You haven’t changed a bit. You’re exactly
the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much
either.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: It hasn’t…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I can’t wait to breathe the sweet breeze
that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force,
those hills are what I see.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I love Naboo.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Were you dreaming about you mother earlier,
weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes… I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory
of her is fading. I don’t want to lose it. Recently I’ve been seeing her
in my dreams… vivid dreams… scary dreams. I worry about her.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coruscant, downtown, back street - morning</strong>:
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old
buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional
“shiny freighters” hissing through.</p>
<p><strong>int. coruscant, dex’s diner - morning</strong>: A young
waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a
counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A
number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER
DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.</p>
<p><strong>hermione</strong>: Can I help ya?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m looking for Dexter.</p>
<p><strong>hermione bagwa</strong>: Waddya want him for?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He’s not in trouble. It’s personal.</p>
<p><strong>hermione bagwa</strong>: Someone to see ya, honey A Jedi, by
the looks of him.</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: Obi-Wan!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Hey, Dex.</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: Take a seat! Be right with ya!</p>
<p><strong>hermione bagwa</strong>: You want a cup of ardees?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: Hey, ol’ buddy!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Hey, Dex.</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: So, my friend. What can I do for
ya?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You can tell me what this is.</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: Well, whattaya know…</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: I ain’t seen one of these since I
was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Do you know where it came from?</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: This baby belongs to them cloners.
What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Kamino Kyberdart… I wonder why it didn’t
show up in any analysis archive.</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: It’s these funny little cuts on the
side give it away… Those analysis droids you’ve got over there only
focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more
respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
wouldn’t be here, would we? Kamino… doesn’t sound familiar. Is it part
of the Republic?</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: No, it’s beyond the Outer Rim. I’d
say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It
should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find.
Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They’re cloners. Damned good ones,
too.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Cloners? Are they friendly?</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: It depends.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: On what, Dex?</p>
<p><strong>dexter jettster</strong>: On how good your manners are… and
how big your pocketbook is…</p>
<p><strong>ext. naboo spaceport - day</strong>: The Starfreighter lands
in the giant port city of Theed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. naboo palace, grand courtyard - afternoon</strong>: The
speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The
great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored
dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their
gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: If I grew up here, I don’t think I’d ever
leave.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, really. When I started my training, I
was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only
pleasant things I had to think about… The problem was, the more I
thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I
thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way
the air always smells of flowers…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: …and the soft sound of the distant
waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young… I’d
never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful… I never
dreamed one day I’d live in the palace.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, tell me, did you dream of power and
politics when you were a little girl?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: No! That was the last thing I thought of. My
dream was to help in the “Refugee Relief Movement.” I never thought of
running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I
realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I
joined the “Apprentice Legislators”, then later on became a Senatorial
advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected
Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but
for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I
wasn’t the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it,
I’m not sure I was old enough. I’m not sure I was ready.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The people you served thought you did a good
job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in
office.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It
gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I
was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried
About me during the blockade and couldn’t wait for it all to be over.
Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now… My sisters have the most
amazing, wonderful kids… but when the Queen asked me to serve as
Senator, I couldn’t refuse her.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I agree! I think the Republic needs you… I’m
glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our
generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I think so too.</p>
<p><strong>int. naboo palace, throne room - afternoon</strong>: QUEN
JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF
ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the
doors.</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: We’ve been worried about you. I’m so
glad you’re safe, Padm�.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could
have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.</p>
<p><strong>sio bibble</strong>: Given the circumstances, Senator, you
know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made.</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: How many systems have joined Count
Dooku and the separatists?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: About two hundred. And more are leaving the
Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I’m sure it’s
going to push us into a civil war.</p>
<p><strong>sio bibble</strong>: It’s unthinkable! There hasn’t been a
full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: Do you see any way, through
negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Not if they feel threatened. The separatists
don’t have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend
themselves. I’m sure of that. And with no time or money to build an
army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade
Federation for help.</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: The armies of commerce! Why has
Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I’m afraid that, despite the Chancellor’s
best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even
Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.</p>
<p><strong>sio bibble</strong>: It’s outrageous! After all of those
hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still
the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control
everything?</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: Remember, Counsellor, the courts
were able to reduce the Federation’s armies. That’s a move in the right
direction.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: There are rumours, Your Highness, that the
Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Jedi have not been allowed to
investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were
told.</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: We must keep our faith in the
Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we
lose it.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Let’s pray that day never comes.</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: In the meantime, we must consider
your own safety.</p>
<p><strong>sio bibble</strong>: What is your suggestion, Master
Jedi?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Anakin’s not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He’s
still a Padawan learner. I was thinking…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hey, hold on a minute!</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the
Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here,
M’Lady.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my
home. I know it very well… that is why we’re here. I think it would be
wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sorry, M’Lady.</p>
<p><strong>sio bibble</strong>: She is right. The Lake Country is the
most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the
surrounding terrain.</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: Perfect. It’s settled then.</p>
<p><strong>queen jamillia</strong>: Padm�, I had an audience with your
father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit
your mother before you leave… your family’s very worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jedi temple - day</strong>: The main entrance at the
base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are
coming and going.</p>
<p><strong>int. jedi temple, archives library - day</strong>: A bronze
bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the
Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features
of the chiselled face.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Did you call for assistance?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes… yes, I did…</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: He has a powerful face, doesn’t he? He
was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of
knowing.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I never understood why he quit. Only twenty
Jedi have ever left the Order.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: The Lost Twenty… and Count Dooku was the
most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His
leaving was a great loss to the Order.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Well, one might say, he was always a bit
out of step with the decisions of the Council… much like your old
Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways.
Very individual thinkers… idealists…</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: He was always striving to become a more
powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old
style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was…
unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the
Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high
expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then
he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Interesting… I’m still not sure I
understand.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Well, I’m sure you didn’t call me over
here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes, I’m trying to find a planet system
called Kamino. It doesn’t seem to show upon any of the archive
charts.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Kamino? It’s not a system I’M familiar
with… Let me see…</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Are you sure you have the right
co-ordinates?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: According to my information, it should be
in this quadrant somewhere… just south of the Rishi Maze.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind
of directions you’d get from a street tout… some old miner or Furbog
trader.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: All three actually.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Are you sure it exists?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: Let me do a gravitational scan.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: There are some inconsistencies here.
Maybe the planet you’re looking for was destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Wouldn’t that be on record?</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: It ought to be. Unless it was very
recent. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you’re searching
for doesn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: That’s impossible… perhaps the archives are
incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>jocasta nu</strong>: The archives are comprehensive and
totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of -
if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!</p>
<p><strong>ext. theed, residential area, side street -
afternoon</strong>: PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD
MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing.
ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his
Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: There’s my house!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What? Don’t say you’re shy!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, but I…</p>
<p><strong>ryoo &amp; pooja</strong>: Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Ryoo!! Pooja!!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m so happy to see you! This is Anakin.
Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.</p>
<p><strong>ryoo &amp; pooja</strong>: Artoo!!!</p>
<p><strong>int. padme’s parents’ house, main room - afternoon</strong>:
SOLA, PADME’S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying
a big bowl of food.</p>
<p><strong>sola</strong>: They’re eating over at Jev Narran’s later,
Mom. They just had a snack. They’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.</p>
<p><strong>sola</strong>: Hello, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jobal</strong>: You’re just in time for dinner. I hope you’re
hungry, Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He’s being polite, Mom. We’re starving.</p>
<p><strong>ruwee</strong>: You came to the right place at the right
time. Sit down, son.</p>
<p><strong>jobal</strong>: Honey, it’s so good to see you safe. We were
so worried.</p>
<p><strong>ruwee</strong>: Dear…</p>
<p><strong>jobal</strong>: I know, I know… but I had to say it. Now it’s
done.</p>
<p><strong>sola</strong>: Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin,
you’re the first boyfriend my sister’s ever brought home?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Sola!! He isn’t my boyfriend! He’s a Jedi
assigned by the Senate to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>joval</strong>: A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn’t tell us
it was that serious!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: It’s not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, Anakin’s a
friend. I’ve known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with
the Jedi during the blockade crisis?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He grew up.</p>
<p><strong>jobal</strong>: Honey, when are you going to settle down?
Haven’t you had enough of that life? I certainly have!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Mom, I’m not in any danger.</p>
<p><strong>ruwee</strong>: Is she?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …Yes… I’m afraid she is.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: But not much.</p>
<p><strong>ext. padme’s parents’ garden - afternoon</strong>: ANAKIN and
RUWEE are walking.</p>
<p><strong>ruwee</strong>: Sometimes I wish I’d traveled more… but I
must say, I’m happy here.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Padme tells me you teach at the
university?</p>
<p><strong>ruwee</strong>: Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also
worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young.</p>
<p><strong>int. padme’s parents’ house, main room - afternoon</strong>:
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.</p>
<p><strong>sola</strong>: Why haven’t you told us about him?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: What’s there to talk about? He’s just a
boy.</p>
<p><strong>sola</strong>: A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at
you?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Sola - stop it!</p>
<p><strong>sola</strong>: It’s obvious he has feelings for you. Are you
saying, little baby sister, that you haven’t noticed?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I’m not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I
are friends… our relationship is strictly professional. Mom, would you
tell her to stop it?</p>
<p><strong>sola</strong>: Well, maybe you haven’t noticed the way he
looks at you. I think you’re afraid to.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>jobal</strong>: Sola’s just concerned… we all are.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Oh, Mom, you’re impossible. What I’m doing is
important.</p>
<p><strong>jobal</strong>: You’ve done your service, Padm�. It’s time
you had a life of your own. You’re missing so much!</p>
<p><strong>ext. padme’s parents’ garden - afternoon</strong>: ANAKIN and
RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN
directly.</p>
<p><strong>ruwee</strong>: Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing?
How much danger is my daughter really in?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: There have been two attempts on her life.
Chances are there’ll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins.
I’m sure he’ll find out who they are. This situation, won’t last
long.</p>
<p><strong>ruwee</strong>: I don’t want anything to happen to her.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t either.</p>
<p><strong>int. padme’s parents’ house, padme’s room -
afternoon</strong>: PADME throws some things into a bag.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Don’t worry, this won’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I just want to get there before dark.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You still live at home.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I move around so much, I’ve never had a place
of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel
at home.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I never had a real home. Home was always
where my Mom was.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Is this you?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: That was when I went with the Relief Group to
Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I
was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I’m holding?
His name was N’a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of
life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he
died… they all did. They were never able to adapt… to live off their
native planet.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: My first day as an Apprentice Legislator.
Notice the difference?</p>
<p><strong>int. jedi temple, main hallway - day</strong>: OBI-WAN walks
through the main hallway to the training area.</p>
<p><strong>int. jedi temple, training veranda - day</strong>: OBI-WAN
comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so
FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear
helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with
their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Don’t think… feel… be as one with the Force.
Help you, it will. Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome
him.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear
Clan.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I am sorry to disturb you, Master.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: What help to you, can I be?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I�m looking for a planet described to me by
an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn�t show up on the
archive maps.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map
reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will
try…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: This is where it ought to be… but it isn�t.
Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There
should be a star here… but there isn�t.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Most interesting. Gravity�s silhouette
remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this
be?</p>
<p><strong>jedi child jack</strong>: Because someone erased it from the
archive memory.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: That�s right! Yes! That�s what happened!
Someone erased it!</p>
<p><strong>jedi child may</strong>: If the planet blew up, the gravity
would go away.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.
Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your
planet you will.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: But Master Yoda who could have erased
information from the archives? That�s impossible, isn�t it?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Much harder to answer, that question is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. naboo lake retreat, water speeder, landing platform -
late afternoon</strong>: A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the
retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing
platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are
sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a
beautiful island in the middle of the lake.</p>
<p><strong>ext. naboo lake retreat, lodge, garden terracem late
afternoon</strong>: ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the
water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden.
Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA,
as they carry the bags into the Lodge.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: When I was in Level Three, we used to come
here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every
day. I love the water.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I do too. I guess it comes from growing up
on a desert planet.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: …We used to lie on the sand and let the sun
dry us… and try to guess the names of the birds singing.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don�t like sand. It�s coarse and rough and
irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything�s
soft… and smooth…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: There was a very old man who lived on the
island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out
of the glass. They were magical.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Everything here is magical.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You could look into the glass and see the
water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real… but it
wasn�t.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sometimes, when you believe something to be
real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I used to think if you looked too deeply into
glass, you would lose yourself.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I think it’s true…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I shouldn’t have done that.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m sorry. When I’m around you, my mind is
no longer my own.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: It’s the situation… the stress…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …the view.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coruscant, landing platform - late afternoon</strong>:
Obi-Wan’s Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand
beside it.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Be wary, this disturbance in the Force
is growing stronger.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not
ready to be on his own.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: The Council is confident in this decision,
Obi-Wan.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: He has exceptional skills. The Council is
confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be
the one to bring balance to the Force.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: But he still has much to learn. And his
abilities have made him… well… arrogant. I realise now what you and
Master Yoda knew from the beginning… the boy was too old to start the
training and…</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: There’s something else?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Master, he should not have been given this
assignment. I’m afraid Anakin won’t be able to protect the Senator.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He has a… an emotional connection with her.
It’s been there since he was boy. Now he’s confused… distracted.</p>
<p><strong>mace-windu</strong>: Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he
will take the right path.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Has Master Yoda gained any insight into
whether or not this war will come about?</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous
process. He could be in seclusion for days… May the force be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>int. jedi temple, yoda’s quarters - late afternoon</strong>:
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>ext. naboo lake retreat, lounge, late afternoon</strong>: The
setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the
rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the
lodge.</p>
<p><strong>int. naboo lake retreat, dining room - late
afternoon</strong>: NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does
the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up
her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries
again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his
plate.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You did that?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: That! Now stop it!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not really supposed to do that… for fun,
I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he’d be very grumpy.</p>
<p><strong>int. naboo lake retreat, lodge, fireplace alcove -
twilight</strong>: A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in
front of it, gazing at the flames.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: May I tell you something?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Then how can I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It doesn’t work around you. My mind is
always a muddle… I can only think of you.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: From the moment I met you, all those years
ago, a day hasn’t gone by when I haven’t thought of you. And now that
I’m close to you again, I’m in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse
it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over -
my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can’t breathe. I’m haunted by the
kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that
kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me.
What can I do? I will do anything you ask…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: If you are suffering as much as I am, tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: …I can’t. We can’t. It’s just not
possible.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Anything’s possible. Padme, please
listen…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You listen. We live in a real world. Come
back to it. You’re studying to become a Jedi Knight. I’m a Senator. If
you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a
place we cannot go… regardless of the way we feel about each other.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Then you do feel something! There’s an
extraordinary connection between us. You can’t deny that.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Annie, it doesn’t make any difference. Jedi
aren’t allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You’d be expelled
from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities… your
future, for me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I was destined to be a Jedi. I don’t think I
could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is
something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away… but
I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I am not going to give into this. I’m not
going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than
fall in love.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It wouldn’t have to be that way… we could
keep it a secret.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Then we’d be living a lie - one we couldn’t
keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I
couldn’t do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …No, you’re right. It would destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>ext. space</strong>: It’s just like the star map hologram,
plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it
ought to be. Obi-Wan’s Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward
the planet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tipoca city, kamino landing platform - day</strong>:
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan’s
Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on
great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that
cover the surface of this watery world.</p>
<p><strong>int. tipoca city, corridor entrance</strong>: A Brilliant
white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.</p>
<p><strong>taun we</strong>: Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>taun we</strong>: Everything is ready. The Prime Minister
expects you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m expected?</p>
<p><strong>taun we</strong>: Of course! He is anxious to see you. After
all these years, we were beginning to think you weren’t coming. Now
please, this way!</p>
<p><strong>int. tipoca city, prime minister office - day</strong>: The
door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU
rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on
Kamino, seems made out of pure light.</p>
<p><strong>taun we</strong>: May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of
Kamino… and this is Master Jedi…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: I trust you are going to enjoy your stay.
We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You make me feel most welcome.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: And now to business. You will be delighted
to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with
another million well on the way.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: That is… good news.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we
have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is
well, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m sorry Master - ?</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He’s still a leading
member of the Jedi Council, is he not?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: You must be anxious to inspect the units
for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. naboo, mountain meadow - later afternoon</strong>: PADME
and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush
grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze
contentedly.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sure you do… you just don’t want to tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind
tricks on me?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They only work on the weak-minded. You are
anything but weak-minded.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: All right… his name was Palo. I was twelve.
We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older
then I… very cute… dark curly hair… dreamy eyes.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: All right, I get the picture… whatever
happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I went on to become a Queen. He went on to
become an artist.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Maybe he was the smart one.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You really don’t like politicians, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I like two or three, but I’m not really sure
about one of them. I don’t think the system works.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: How would you have it work?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We need a system where the politicians sit
down and discuss the problems, agree what’s in the best interests of all
the people, and then do it.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: That is exactly what we do. The trouble is
that people don’t wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Then they should be made to.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: By whom? Who’s going to make them?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t know. Someone.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Of course not me.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: But someone.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Someone wise.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship
to me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, if it works…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You’re making fun of me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: On no, I’d be much too frightened to tease a
Senator.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You’re so bad!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’re always so serious. Always carrying
the weight of the universe on your shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tipoca city, parade ground - day</strong>: OBI-WAN, LAMA
SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground.
The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered
by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several
hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Magnificent, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>int. tipoca city, clone center, comminssary - day</strong>:
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as
they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty
years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: We modified their genetic structure to make
them less independent than the original host. As a result they are
totally obedient, taking any order without question.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wam</strong>: Who was the original host?</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt
a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango
Fett himself.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Where is this bounty hunter now?</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred
thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh
supply. He lives here, but he’s free to come and go as he pleases.</p>
<p><strong>int. tipoca city, clone center, barracks - day</strong>: The
tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent
tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes
to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Apart from his pay, which is considerable,
Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Unaltered?</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Pure genetic replication. No tampering with
the structure to make it more docile… and no growth acceleration…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I would like to meet this Jango Fett.</p>
<p><strong>taun we</strong>: I would be most happy to arrange it, for
you.</p>
<p><strong>int. tipoca city, clone center, classroom - day</strong>: The
tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY
CLONES.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You mentioned growth acceleration…</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Oh yes, it’s essential. Otherwise, a mature
clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time.
Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago,
when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they’re already mature…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: And these?</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: About five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>int. tipoca city, clone center, hatchery - day</strong>: They
enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled
with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: They’re immensely superior to droids,
capable of independent thought and action.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: I’d hoped you would be pleased.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Tell me, prime minister, when my Master
Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for… himself…
or?</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: Himself? Of course not. This army is for
the Republic?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Repubic?</p>
<p><strong>lama su</strong>: We are also very much agasint this Count

and out.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: …I’ve never heard of a Jedi called
Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: No. Whoever placed that order was not a
Jedi, I can assure you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I have a strong feeling that this bounty
hunter is the assassin we’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Who he is working for… discover that, you
must.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I will, Master, and I will also find out
more about this clone army… May The Force…</p>
<p><strong>windu</strong>: A clone army! Ordered by someone in the
Senate perhaps… Someone’s out to start a war.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Inform the chancellor of this, we must.</p>
<p><strong>windu</strong>: Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas,
could be?</p>

<p><strong>pamde</strong>: I don’t want to disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Your presence is soothing.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You had a nightmare again last night.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Jedi don’t have nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I heard you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I
see you now. She’s suffering, Padme. She is in pain…They’re killing her!
I know I’m disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will
be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I
have to help her! I’m sorry, Padme. I don’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Annie, I told you I wouldn’t let you give up
your future for me. I’ll go with you. That way you can continue to
protect me, and you won’t be disobeying your mandate.</p>

productive?</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: Fairly.</p>
<p><strong>taun we</strong>: This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He’s
come to check on our progress.</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: That right?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Your clones are very impressive. You must
be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: I’m just a simple man, trying to make my
way in the universe, Master Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Aren’t we all?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Ever made your way as far into the interior
as Coruscant?</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: Once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Recently?</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: Possibly…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas?</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: Boba, close the door.</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: Master who?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Sido-Dyas. Isn�t he the Jedi who hired you
for this job?</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man
called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No? I thought…</p>
<p><strong>taun we</strong>: Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he
showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the
Jedi�s involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master
requested.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Curious…</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: Do you like your army?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It seems to me it’s your army - being that
they are all clones of you.</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: They’ll do their job well, I’ll guarantee
that.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I look forward to seeing them in action.
Thank you for your time, Jango.</p>
<p><strong>jango</strong>: Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>boba</strong>: What is it, Dad?</p>

<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Wait, please.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: No, not that one - that one!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Excuse me, Watto.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I said excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Shut down.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: What? I don’t know you… What can I do for
you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is… I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Let me help you with that.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m looking for Shmi Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: You are Annie! It is you! You little womp
rat.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: You sure sprouted Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya

<p><strong>anakin</strong>: My mother…</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Oh, yeah. Shmi… she’s not mine no more. I
sold her.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sold her…</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know,
business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I
think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married
her. Can ya beat that?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Do you know where they are?</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Long way from here… someplace over on the
other side of Mos Eisley, I think…</p>

<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: Dad!!</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, bluff overlooking homestead - late
day</strong>: The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff.
ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to
where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Stay with the ship, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, desert, homestead moisture farm - late
day</strong>: C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an
outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN
and PADME arrive,</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Good evening. May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Threepio?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Oh, my… oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I
can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Hello, Threepio.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve come to see my mother.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Oh, dear! I’m so terribly sorry, Master
Annie.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Threepio, what’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: I think we’d better go inside.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, homestead, courtyard - late day</strong>:
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see
you!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m Anakin Skywalker. I’m here looking for
my mother.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Owen Lars… I guess I’m your step-brother. This
is my girlfriend, Beru.</p>
<p><strong>beru</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m Padme.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: I had a feeling you might show up some
day.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Is my mother here?</p>
<p><strong>cliegg</strong>: No, she’s not.</p>
<p><strong>cliegg</strong>: Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife… Come on
inside. We have a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>int. tatooine, homestead, kitchen - late day</strong>: BERU
puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the

nowhere. A hunting party of Tusekn Raiders.</p>
<p><strong>int. tatooine, homestead, dining area - late day</strong>:
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the
drinks from the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>cliegg</strong>: Your mother had gone out early, like she
always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the
tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk
like men, but they’re vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out
after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking.
I’d be with them, only… I just couldn’t ride any more… until I heal.</p>
<p><strong>cliegg</strong>: This isn’t the way I wanted to meet you,
son. This isn’t how your mother and I planned it. I don’t want to give
up on her, but she’s been gone a month. There’s little hope she’s lasted
this long.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: To find my mother.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: No, Annie!</p>
<p><strong>cliegg</strong>: She’s daed, son. Accept it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I
know she’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, homestead, moisture farm - late day</strong>:
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the
homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You are going to have to stay here. These
are good people, Padme. You’ll be safe.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Take my speeder bike.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I trust you’ll watch over her, Owen.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>ext. space, geonosis</strong>: The red planet of Geonosis is
circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett’s ship
appears, heading toward it.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit, fett ship, space, geonosis</strong>: JANGO FETT
grins at BOBA FETT.</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: Nearly there, son.</p>
<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: Dad, look!!</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>ext. space, geonosis</strong>: The ships flip, roll, and turn
at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near
misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan’s fighter as one of Jango’s missiles gets
through.</p>
<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: Dad! Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: Stay calm, son. We’ll be fine. That Jedi
won’t be able to follow us through this.</p>
<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: Got him! Yeahhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: We won’t see him again.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, desert, jawa camp - sunset</strong>: ANAKIN
stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions.

direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA
pointed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, dune sea, campfire - twilight</strong>: ANAKIN
rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, landscape - night</strong>: THREE DIFFERENT
SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In
one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his
speeder and rides off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, desert, homestead - night</strong>: The lights
of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night
animal HOWLS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, homestead, courtyard - night</strong>: PADME
is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal
HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the
garage at the side of the courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>int. tatooine, homestead - garage - night</strong>: PADME
stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence.
Then:</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Please don’t leave us, Miss Padme. These
people need your help.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m not leaving, Threepio. I just can’t
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: That’s something I cannot relate to. As a
Protocol Droid, I’m either active or inactive. There’s no
in-between.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I guess you’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Do you really think so..? I suppose I
shouldn’t expect…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re not happy here?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Oh, I’m not unhappy… and my masters here ar
so kind I wouldn’t wish to trouuble them, it’s just… being like this…
well, it’s embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Being like what?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see,
when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any
outer covering. It’s so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to
go around with all your circuits showing?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I guess I wouldn’t like it at all.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Of course you wouldn’t. Nobody would. It’s
simply not protocol.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Maybe we can do something about it.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: I don’t think so. Only Master Annie…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Why not? They seem to have a box of old
coverings here.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of
course, I’m just not mechanically minded… if you see what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Let’s see, if we put this… here…</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Ooooh! That’s tickles.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’ll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold
still, please.</p>
<p><strong>ext. space, geonosis rings</strong>: A huge chunk of rock
tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover

skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He

climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN
stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of
peblles skittering into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, cliff - night</strong>: ANAKIN pulls up near
the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He
looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at
the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, tusken raider camp, oasis - night</strong>:
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut,
flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken
conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives
at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from
the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber
and cuts into the base of the wall.</p>
<p><strong>int. tusken raider hutt - night</strong>: The lightsaber
completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to
his feet. There are candles everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I�m here, Mom. You�re safe. Hang on. I�m
going to get you out of here…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: I�m so glad… to see you, Annie… Now… I am
complete…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Just stay with me, Mom. I�m going to make
you well again. Everything�s going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: You look so handsome. My son… my grown-up son.

loom indistinctly.</p>

pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear

She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>ext. geonosis, landing area - night</strong>: OBI-WAN comes
running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into
his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on
his comlink.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: “Guiding light” to “old folks home.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. coruscant, republic executive building - day</strong>:
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked
by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome
building.</p>
<p><strong>int. coruscant, chancellor’s office</strong>: A hologram of
OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi and Senators .
PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with
growing concern.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: …Starships from the Trade Federation and
the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the
foundries on Geonosis.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: That’s outrageous! The treaty forbids
the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The droid foundry seems to be working at
full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango
Fett back home for interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Those Geonosian foundries are part of the
Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few
very pointed questions.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: One more thing. Jango mentioned he was
recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might
be?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: With the forename Darth, a Sith he must
be.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Our missing apprentice. They are playing
their hand at last.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Do you believe he could be the mysterious
Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this
puzzle, there are.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation
is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Let me see if I can figure out what’s going
on first.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: The Commerce Guilds are preparing for
war… there can be no doubt of that.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Count Dooku must have made a treaty with
them.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: We must stop them soon before they’re
fully ready.</p>
<p><strong>senator ask aak</strong>: The debate is over, we need that
clone army now!</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Unfortunately, the debate is not over.
The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the
separatists attack.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: This is a crisis! If the Senate votes
the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Please, please, I don’t wish to have
emergency powers. That’s too extreme a solution. It’s akin to a
dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are
available to go to Geonosis?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Two Hundred,… less or more.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: With all due respect for the Jedi
Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle
droids.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to
report back. We don’t know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the
Corporate Alliance, it’s speculation.</p>
<p><strong>senator ask aak</strong>: But we must prepare for the worst.
I’m going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the
Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Out of the question, Senator! You and I
are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will
begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: If only Senator Amidala were here.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Supreme Chancellor… my august colleagues, I
would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave
situation, and I’m sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo would
agree.</p>
<p><strong>senator ask aak</strong>: Thank you, Representative
Binks.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: If called upon, I will serve. But it will
be the saddest day of my life.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, desert, homestead moisture farm -
day</strong>: All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a
moisture line and starts to draw water.</p>
<p><strong>int. tatooine, homestead, garage - day</strong>: PADME fixes

<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I’m so happy! Oh,
pardon me.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from
now on… I know that is what my Mom would want.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Oh, my!</p>
<p><strong>beru</strong>: Come topside, everybody! He’s back! He’s
back!</p>
<p><strong>int. tatooine, homestead, garage - day</strong>: A rough
hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME
and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: …Alliance have pledged their armies to
Count Dooku and are forming an… Wait!… ah… attack… I don’t… make it…
aaaggghhh!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m going after him!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I thought the first thing he said was to
retransmit his message to Coruscant.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yeah, you’re right, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, homestead, moisture farm - late day</strong>:
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG,
OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit, naboo starship - sunset</strong>: ANAKIN sits
down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside
him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: We will deal with Count Dooku. The most
important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the
Senator at all costs. That is your priority.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Understood, Master.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: They’ll never get there in time to save him.
They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less
than a parsec away.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: If he’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Annie, are you just going to sit here and let
him die?? He’s your friend… your mentor…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …He’s like my father, but you heard Master
Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He gave you strict orders to protect me…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: …and I’m going to save Obi-Wan. So if you
plan to protect me, you will have to come along.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tatooine, bluff overlooking homestead - sunset</strong>:
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coruscant, jedi temple - day</strong>: TWO HUNDRED JEDI
KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.</p>
<p><strong>int. coruscant, jedi temple, council chamber - day</strong>:
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku’s
armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about
granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use
that clone army… We have the authority to go now. We must go now.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send.
Enough, let’s hope they are.</p>
<p><strong>int. coruscant, main senate chamber - day</strong>: Inside
the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell
furiously at one another.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Order! Order!!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: In the regrettable absence of Senator
Amidala, the chair recognises Senior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
Binks.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Senators, dellow felagates…</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Order! The Senate will accord the
Representative the courtesy of a hearing!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: In response to the direct threat to the
Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the
Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Who can deny these are exceptional times?
Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures
demand exceptional men!</p>
<p><strong>orn free taa</strong>: We won’t support a dictator.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: That is the sentiment every one of us
agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day
of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme
Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties
will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: It is with great reluctance that I have
agreed to this calling. I love democracy… I love the Republic. The fact
that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you
is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the
democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this
crisis has abated, I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my
current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my
life in peace.</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: We shall proceed to the vote. All those
in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal
ate at this time… those opposed?</p>
<p><strong>ext. space</strong>: The Naboo Starship heads toward the
rings of Geonosis.</p>
<p><strong>ext. geonosis, landing area</strong>: The Naboo Starship
lands.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit, naoo starfighter - day</strong>: ANAKIN
switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area
of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot’s seat. She gets up.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hey, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: To find Obi-Wan.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No! You’re not!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Let go of me!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not letting you go out there. It’s too
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It’s my job to protect you. I said it’s too
dangerous. You’re not going, and that’s final!</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Don’t you give me orders, Annie! I’m a
Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me,
restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you
can come along and protect me or stay here. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment
they’re generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of
violent hostility. Even though I’m programmed to understand them, I
doubt if I ever shall.</p>
<p><strong>int. geonosis, corridors - day</strong>: ANAKIN and PADME
enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the
emptiness.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: It’s empty!</p>
<p><strong>int. geonosis, central square - day</strong>: ANAKIN and
PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR
GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Senator Amidala, I’ve heard so much
about you.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Count Dooku, I assume.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: I’m delighted to meet you at last. We
have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young
Jedi under control.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Don’t worry he’s housebroken.</p>
<p><strong>int. conference room - day</strong>: COUNT DOOKU sits at a
large conference table with PADME on the far side. ANAKIN stands behind
her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands
behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan
Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now.</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: He has been convicted of espionage, Senator,
and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: He is an officer of the Republic. You can’t
do that.</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: We don’t recognise the Republic here,
Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear
your plea for clemency.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: And if I don’t join your rebellion, I assume
this Jedi with me will also die?</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: I don’t wish to make you to join our cause
against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest
representative of your people and I assume you want to do what’s in
their best interest. Aren’t you fed up with the corruption, the
bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren’t you? Be honest,
Senator.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: The ideals are still alive, Count, even if
the institution is failing.</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: You believe in the same ideals we believe in!
The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: If what you say is true, you should stay in
the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: The Chancellor means well, M’Lady but he is
incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats
are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is
time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a
shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of
greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all
I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your
treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others,
Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out
by business… it’s business becoming government!</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends?
Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed
also?</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: I wouldn’t think of such an offence. But,
there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M’lady.
It has nothing to do with politics, I’m afraid. It’s purely personal,
and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I’m sure
they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I’m sorry
but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the
Geonosians for justice. I’ve done all I can for you.</p>
<p><strong>jango fett</strong>: I’ll take that weapon.</p>
<p><strong>dooku</strong>: You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young
Jedi, but you will not escape.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Anakin…</p>
<p><strong>int. geonosis, high audience chamber - day</strong>: ANAKIN
and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom.
Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER,
Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off
to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA.
Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL
ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along
the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.</p>
<p><strong>sun rit</strong>: You have been charged and found guilty of
Espionage.</p>
<p><strong>poggle</strong>: Do you have anything to say before your
sentence is carried out?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I
hope you are prepared for the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>poggle</strong>: We build weapons, Senator… that is our
business! Of course we’re prepared!</p>
<p><strong>nute gunray</strong>: Get on with it. Carry out the sentence.
I want to see her suffer.</p>
<p><strong>poggle</strong>: Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you,
Senator. Take them to the arena!</p>
<p><strong>int. geonosis tunnel to execution arena - day</strong>: In
the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The
murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms
along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each
other.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I’m not afraid to die. I’ve been dying a
little bit each day since you came back into my life.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You love me?! I thought we decided not to
fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would
destroy our lives…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: I think our lives are about to be destroyed
anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers.
I can’t control it… and now I don’t care. I truly, deeply love you, and
before we die I want you to know.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I have no desire to be cured of this love
either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.</p>
<p><strong>int. geonosis, execution arena - day</strong>: The great
stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart
trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright
posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN
are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the
center.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten
my message.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I retransmitted it as you requested, Master.
Then we decided to come and rescue you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It looks like you’re going a good job so
far.</p>
<p><strong>sun rit</strong>: The felons before you have been convicted
of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of
death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth.</p>
<p><strong>poggle</strong>: Let the executions begin!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Take the one the left. I’ll take the one on
the right.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What about Padme?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It looks like she’s already on top of
things.</p>
<p><strong>nute gunray</strong>: Foul!! She can’t do that… shoot her or
something!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Sure! Well, sort of.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Jump!!!</p>
<p><strong>nute gunray</strong>: This isn’t how it’s supposed to be!
Jango, finish her off.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Patiece, Viceroy… she will die. Maybe
this is the way it’s supposed to end.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you
suppose something’s happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: Danger? Oh no, I shouldn’t think so. It looks
a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop
worrying, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>ext. geonosis, execution arena - day</strong>: In the
archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder.
He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his
surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS
standing at every entrance and exit.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Master Windu, how pleasant of you to
join us. You’re just in time for the moment of truth. I would think
these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This
party’s over.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend.
You’re impossibly outnumbered.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: I don’t think so. One Jedi has to be
worth a hundred Geonosians.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: It wasn’t the Geonosians I was thinking
about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand
battle droids?</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit, naboo starship</strong>: ARTOO whistles.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: I don’t hear anything. You’re scaring me!
Stop imagining things!</p>
<p><strong>ext. geonosis, execution arena - day</strong>: Among the
tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of
GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are
telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are
retreating into the arena.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Someone’s got to - shut down - these
droids.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Don’t worry! It’s being - taken care
of!</p>
<p><strong>ext. geonosis, federation starship - day</strong>:
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the
lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of
DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The
rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.</p>
<p><strong>int. command federation starship, corridors - day</strong>:
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the
corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing
DROIDS.</p>
<p><strong>int. command federation starship, control bridge -
day</strong>: THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND
DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over
the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches
down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and
all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!</p>
<p><strong>plo koon</strong>: We’ve done it! Now we have a chance!</p>
<p><strong>ki-adi-mundi</strong>: The system’s off but they’re still
active. That’s a new feature. They are independent of the control
system.</p>
<p><strong>ext. geonosis, execution arena - day</strong>: MACE WINDU,
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand
in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The
bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS,
SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Master Windu!</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: You have fought gallantly. Worthy of
recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is
finished. Surrender - and your lives will be spared.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: We will not be hostages for you to
barter with Dooku.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Then, I’m sorry, old friend. You will
have to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Come on - hurry! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>ext. geonosis, terrain outside execution arena -
day</strong>: The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the
DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of
Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS.
Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.</p>
<p><strong>int. gunship number one - day</strong>: MACE WINDU stares at
the incredible sight.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: More battalions to the left. Encircle them we
must, then divide.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit, naboo starship - day</strong>: THREEPIO and
ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>c-3po</strong>: I’m sure I heard something, this time. Didn’t
you? It’s probably just a celebration</p>
<p><strong>ext. battlefield, geonosis landscape - day</strong>: Gunship
#2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from
the droids.</p>
<p><strong>int. gunship number two - day</strong>: OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and
PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the
DROIDS below.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Hold on! Look over there…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It’s Dooku, go after him!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Padme!!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Put the ship down! Down!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No! Forget her. We have to go after
Dooku.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No we’re not!! Land this ship!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t let your personal feelings get in the
way. We’ve got a job to do.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t care!.. Go back.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin! She’s all right! Look.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Follow that speeder!</p>
<p><strong>int. geonosis, secret hanger tower - late day</strong>: COUNT
DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is
guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port
slide open.</p>
<p><strong>droid captain</strong>: Your Excellency!</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: That won’t be necessary, Captain. Stand
down. And leave them to me.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: We move in together - you slowly on
the…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m taking him now!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin, no!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’ll pay for all the Jedi you’ve killed
today, Dooku.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Kenobi, isn’t it? As you can see, my
Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Ah, but if I must.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: I have spent the last ten years
learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
greater power.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You will have to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Surely you can do better…? No, I’m
surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you
trying to make fun of me? Which is it?</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out
of my misery.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: That’s brave of you, boy - but foolish.
I would have thought you’d have learnt your lesson.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m a slow learner.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: You have unusual powers, young Padawan.
But not enought to save you this time.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t bet on it!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Anakin!</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: Master Yoda. At last we shall know who
is the most powerful.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I
have.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: The end for you, Count, this is.</p>
<p><strong>count dooku</strong>: …Not yet…</p>
<p><strong>padm�</strong>: Anakin!</p>
<p><strong>clone captain</strong>: Resistance is at an end, General.
What are your orders ?</p>

<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting
Senator Amidala home.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I must admit without the clones, it would
not have been a victory.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Victory? Victory, you say?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Not victory, a defeat, it was… Master Obi-Wan.
Begun, the Clone War has!</p>
