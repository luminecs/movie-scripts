<h1 id="the-time-machine">the-time-machine</h1>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: I say, this is outright rude of the
man!</p>
<p><strong>filbey</strong>: He’s undoubtedly been detained. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Speak up – what is it, woman?</p>
<p><strong>bridewell</strong>: Well…are we or are we not invited to
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Nothing really. - George merely says that if
he is not here by eight we’re to begin without him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: Dinner is served, gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: This is peculiar. He is usually very prompt,
precise and punctual.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: He’s making fools of us by inviting us
here and then not showing up. It’s not the behavior of a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: To say nothing of the waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Good lord! - What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I’m all right…just some food…a
drink…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Meat…I’m hungry for meat!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Well, can’t you speak, man? What
happened to you? Aren’t you going to tell us…</p>
<p><strong>bridewell</strong>: Leave him alone, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: It will keep, George. Eat, rest a little.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: No! I must tell it now… while I
still remember.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Relax, try to relax a bit. You’ve all the
time in the world.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You’re right, David. That’s exactly
what I have. - All the time in the world!… ever since we were all
together five days ago, the last day of Eighteen Hundred Ninety
Nine.</p>
<p>****: The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: There in that box rests the
result of two years’ labor.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I wanted to finish the job before
the new century began. - I barely made it.</p>
<p><strong>bridewell</strong>: Marvelous.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Well, it has to do with time.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: I’ve always maintained what this nation
needs is a reliable timepiece. The Navy needs one. The Army needs one. -
For the artillery you know.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: When I speak of time, I’m referring
to the fourth dimension.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Go on, George.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Now, as you know, the difficulty in
explaining the fourth dimension is that it cannot be seen or felt - it
must be thought of.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: If you don’t mind, George, would you refresh
me on the first three dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Really, Filby, they must have taught
you something at school!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Certainly! When I move in a straight
line, forward or backward, that’s one dimension. - When I move to the
left or right, two dimensions. - When I move up and down, three
dimensions. For instance, this box has three dimensions: length,
breadth, and height.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Well, that’s…that’s mere theory! No one
can really say what the fourth dimension is or even that it exists.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: On the contrary, Doctor! The fourth
dimension is as true and as real a dimension as any of the other three.
In fact, they couldn’t exist without it.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Well, take that box. It has the
first three dimensions, as you said. But what if it didn’t exist in
Time? It wouldn’t exist at all, would it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: So - for an object to exist at all,
it must exist in the fourth dimen- sion….and that fourth dimension is
duration….Time!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I’m coming to that. But first,
consider! Why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension? Because
we have no freedom to move in it. We can move in the other three – up,
down, forward, backward, sideways. But when it comes to Time, we are
prisoners. Do you follow me, Anthony?</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: George! You’ve given a most lucid explanation
and all that! But I don’t think I entirely understand.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Look! There are a lot of things in
the world you don’t understand, aren’t there?</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: Of course! Quite a number.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: But you don’t refuse to believe in
them because of that?</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: Not if I can see the proof with my own
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Good! All I’m asking you to do now
is to witness a demonstration of the possibility of movement in the
fourth dimension. Philip, will you please hand me that box?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I’ve told you. The larger model can
carry a passenger on a journey through Time. - Not through Space, mind
you, but through Time.</p>
<p><strong>bridewell</strong>: Oh, I say George! If you start floating
around in the future, aren’t you likely to mess things up for the rest
of us?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: The future is already there. It’s
irrevocable and cannot be changed.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: That’s the most important question
to which I hope to find an answer. Can Man control his destiny? Can he
change the shape of things to come?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Imagine that this cigar is
the Time Traveller. Now, this lever in front of him controls movement.
Forward pressure sends the Machine into the future, backward pressure
into the past. And the harder the pressure the faster the Machine
travels.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: This experiment can be performed
only once. If it succeeds, I lose my model forever. That is why I need
witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You’re ready then?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Doctor Hillyer, would you care to
lend me your hand?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Where did it go?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Do you seriously expect us to believe
that?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: But you just said it hasn’t really
moved.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Then why can’t we see it?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Because we’re in this room on
December 31st, 1899, while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years
away. This room, or even this house, may no longer exist a hundred years
from now. But the Time Machine is occupying the same space it did a
moment before it went off on its journey.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You must remember that the space
you’ve just put your hand through is today’s space. You can’t put your
hand into the space of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: No! Time changes space. This flat
ground we’re standing on now could have been at the bottom of the sea a
million years ago. And a million years from now it could be the interior
of a huge mountain.</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: Suppose what you say is true. Exactly what do
you suggest we do with such a contraption?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: For my part, I intend to take a
journey into the future. - Unless someone else prefers to volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Now listen, George! I don’t know what
you take us for, but we’re not fools. There are a number of ways of
doing a disappearing trick! But a man of your ability should not bother
with such nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Now you’re being sensible. I’ll take
care of it first thing in the New Year.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Well, time to go.</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: Yes, we all have our plans for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Of course, I am.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer’s voice</strong>: Coming, Bridewell?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George - Happy
Twentieth Century. - Etc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Come on, Bridewell.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: I thought I’d better stay.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: You needn’t have troubled
yourself. I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: No you’re not. - You’ve been behaving oddly
for over a month now. I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s on your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I appreciate your gesture, David,
but if you don’t mind I’d rather you left me alone.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: You have changed, George. Enormously.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Why this preoccupation with Time?</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Don’t go simple on me, George!</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: I quite agree with you. But here we are and
we have to make the best of it.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You may have to. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I prefer the future.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: You’re not seriously saying you can do
it?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You saw the experiment this
afternoon, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: I saw a toy machine vanish. But I’m certain
there are a number of ways of doing that trick. Any magician at the
Hippodrome could probably do it.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: No, I would not! I have no desire to tempt
the laws of Providence and I don’t think you should. It’s not for man to
trifle with.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Now you sound like Hillyer and
Kemp.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: There is something in their common sense
attitude to life. George, I speak to you as a friend. More, as a
brother. If that machine can do what you say it can…destroy it. Destroy
it, George, before it destroys you.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You must have plans for New Year’s
Eve. Don’t let me keep you.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Mary isn’t well. We decided to stay home with
the baby. But why don’t you come home with me. You haven’t seen little
Jaime for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: What’s stopping you?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I just want to see the old century
out by myself.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Will you promise me that you won’t leave the
house tonight?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I promise you, I won’t walk out of
the door.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: David! Please don’t think me un-
friendly! - Come over to dinner - next Friday. Won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Fine…and will you bring the others
with you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: Will you be having supper in this
evening, sir?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: Thank you, sir, but if you won’t be
needing me I think I’ll turn in early and get some sleep… …it I can. -
Goodnight, sir.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Watchett! I’ve invited
Mr. Filby and the others to dinner next Friday. Happy New Year,
Mrs. Watchett.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: Happy New Year, sir.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: I started…and the laboratory
grew faint around me…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: …I stopped.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: No change; everything
exactly as it bad been before. - But no!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: And yet by my watch which
was in the machine with me, only a few seconds had passed.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: It was disconcerting to see
the sun…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: …arc in less than a
minute…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: ….to see flowers closing
their eyes for the night, changes that normally took hours, occuring in
seconds, was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: And as yet I was travelling
very slowly! What if I went faster?!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: It became intoxicating. To
see an entire storm in a few seconds. - So I pushed the lever on toward
even greater speed.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Thirteen years had
passed…fourteen… fifteen…sixteen…and then…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: In the year nineteen hundred
seventeen… I stopped.</p>
<p>****: The house is situated upon a site with</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Filby! I expected more of an
enthusiastic greeting from…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Was?</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: Were you a friend of father’s?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Yes…yes…I’ve been away.</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: He was killed in the war…a year
ago.</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: Oh, him. Some inventor who disappeared
around the turn of the century. - If you’re interested in that house,
forget it. You can’t buy it or even go inside.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: My father was executor of the
inventor’s estate and he refused to liquidate it. I often chided him on
that account, but he felt positive that the owner would return some day.
- Some people hereabouts think it’s haunted. Who are you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Just a stranger who once knew your
father.</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: I see. Have you been at the front,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Front? What front?</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: Why the war, of course.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What war?</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: Great heavens, man, don’t you know
we’ve been at war with Germany since nineteen fourteen? I thought
perhaps you had seen action in France…or maybe… Perhaps a cup of tea
would make you feel better. Won’t you come in?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: No…no, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>james filby</strong>: You’re sure you’re alright, sir?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Yes, I’m quite alright.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Goodbye, Jaime.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: As I went along, I gained
experience in handling the Machine. I found that I could stop for a day,
an hour, or even for a second to observe, then go ahead for a year or
two. - Thus I was able to see the changing world in a series of
glimpses.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Good heavens, that’s a dress?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: This was intriguing. I
wondered just how far women would permit this to go.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: I began to grow fond of that
mannequin. Maybe because, like me, she didn’t age.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Suddenly, in nineteen forty
I began to be buffeted from side to side. My first thought was that the
Machine had a mechanical defect or a part had worn out.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: The last time I had stopped
was in nineteen seventeen, twenty three years ago. And the war with
Germany was still waging - now in the air with flying machines. It
didn’t seem possible they could go on fighting all these years and still
have the means of fighting. Then I realized the truth of the matter.
This was a new war. There must have been an interval of peace in between
these wars. Yet they had learned nothing but to prepare even more
effective means of destroying one another. I decided to push on into
time and see the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: The fighting in the sky
lasted only a few moments. By nineteen forty five it was over, but I
continued on a few more years before pausing for another glimpse of my
silent, never aging friend.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: It vas reassuring to find
that she hadn’t changed. Only her costume. Provocative to say the least.
I wondered what she would look like ten years hence.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: At first I wondered if my
Machine and I were the cause of the panic. I was to soon find out we
weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I can’t understand you.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Confounded radio in this thing. Makes more
noise than it does sense.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Filby!</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: My name is Mister Filby. - Didn’t you hear
the air raid siren?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You mean that horrible
screeching?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: It wasn’t constructed for its aesthetic
values, you know, but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get
down into the shelter. Now go on.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: But I’m perfectly comfortable and I
find your store magnificent. What splendid achievements, what gigantic
strides mankind has taken, what…</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Come on, young man. We’d better be going
before the mushrooms start sprouting. You do look familiar. Haven’t we
met somewhere before?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Indeed we have. Right here. Many
years ago.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I was sure of that, but the exact time
escapes me.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: It was two wars ago, I believe.
Nineteen seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I’m afraid it’s going to take me a
little time to explain… You see…</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: The last alert…hurry!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Listen to me! It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Hurry! Hide ’til the All Clear!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: All clear? I’ve got to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: The labor of centuries gone
in an instant.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: But then Mother Earth,
aroused by man’s violence, responded with volcanic violence or her
own!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Then I saw my own danger. I
too was to be engulfed!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: But to go back was
unthinkable.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Only my speed through time
saved me from being roasted alive and encased in stone forever.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: The molten rock cooled. I
prayed…wondering how many centuries, how many eons must pass before the
wind and rain could wear away the mountain that enclosed me.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Darkness…darkness for
centuries.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: I wondered if there was
still war being waged on the ground above me… if man would still exist
on earth, when I saw the sun again.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: The centuries rolled by. - I
put my trust in time and waited for the rock to wear down around me.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: I was free again!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Thousands of centuries
passed, but the earth stayed green! There was no winter! No wars! - Had
man finally learned to control both the elements and themselves? - I had
to stop and find out.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Nature tamed completely and
more bountiful than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Flowers everywhere…the whole
landscape one vast garden with no sign of weeds or briars.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Unrepaired for centuries!
Maybe unlived in for as long. It would be no Paradise if it belonged to
me alone.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Well, and why not?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Help her!…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: Why did you?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Why did I what?</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: Come after me.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Must have been fifty of your friends
watching you drown. Not one of them so much as lifted a finger. - A
curious attitude - in a curious world. Aren’t you the least bit
interested in what I am…where I come from?</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: There is no one older.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Doesn’t anyone age in this land of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: Weena.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: How do you spell that?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Spell?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Write! - Can’t you write? Look!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: And what are your people called?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Come. We must go in.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: In my time a berry this size would
have made news in every civilized country.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
Perhaps even courtesy has died, but I have come a long way and there are
things I would like to know.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Because I shall return to my time
and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your
world.</p>
<p><strong>man in white</strong>: We have no government.</p>
<p><strong>man in white</strong>: There are no laws.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Doesn’t anyone work?</p>
<p><strong>man in white</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man in white</strong>: It grows. It always grows.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: But it must be planted, cultivated,
nurtured…unless… Unless you have an economy so well organized that you
can devote all your time to study and experimentation. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>man in white</strong>: You ask many questions.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Books will tell me what I want to
know. Books will tell me all about you.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Yes…they do tell me all about
you!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What have you done? Thousands of
years of building and rebuilding creating and re-creating so that you
can let it crumble to dust.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: A million yesterdays of sensitive
men dying for their dreams. For what? So you can swim and dance and
play.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I am returning to my time! Not to
tell of the uselessness of the struggle - not to tell of the hopeless
future - but only so that I can die among men!</p>
<p>****: The surrounding is suggestive of the spot</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: I heard you pounding…I came to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: How do you open that panel?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: No one opens it. Only the Morlocks.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Morlocks? - Who are the
Morlocks?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Why are you afraid of the
Morlocks?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: When they call, we must go below.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Do the Morlocks live beneath the
earth? Why must you obey their command?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: They give us the food we eat, the clothes we
wear. We must do as they command.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What happens to your people when
they go below?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: It is night.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Only children are frightened by the
dark. - But then you are a child, aren’t you? I’ll build a fire.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: I hoped to learn a great
deal. I hoped to take back the knowledge, the advancement, mankind made…
instead what do I find? Vegetables!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Get me a few more twigs.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: I never saw it before.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Do you know that the first thing
which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of
fire? No, I suppose you don’t. The next great stride came with the
discovery of the wheel. Do you know what that is? I’m sorry I was angry
with your people. I had no right to be. No more than if I had visited
the Island of Bali in my own time. You were safe inside your great
house, yet you came out into the night to warn me. The one
characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the
spirit of self sacrifice. You have that quality, Girl. I’m sure all of
your people have it. All it requires is someone to reawaken it. I shall
try if you’ll let me. Will you?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: I do not understand you, but I believe
you.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: That’s a good start. - Now try to
tell me…who or what are the Morlocks? Are they people or animals? What
do you know about yourself? The past? Don’t your people ever speak of
the past?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: There is no past.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Don’t you ever wonder about the
future?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: There is no future.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Man’s past is mainly a grim struggle
for survival, but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken
up. These rare moments have made the history of man a glorious thing. I
refuse to believe it is dead and gone. We’ve had our dark ages before
and this is only another of them. All you need is for someone to show
you the way out. - I’m only a tinkering mechanic, but there must be this
hidden spark in one of your people. If I can only kindle that spark, my
coming here will have some meaning.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: My efforts next morning to
open the panel were fruitless. I had to find another way to retrieve my
Machine.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Listen! Do you hear?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Machines!</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: No…Morlocks.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You mean those animals run
machines?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: They are Morlocks.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I know, but have you seen the
machines?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: No, only heard of them.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: The talking rings.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What sort of rings?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Rings that talk.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Can you show me these rings?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Are these the talking rings?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: They speak?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Things no one here understands.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: How do you get it to talk?</p>
<p><strong>voice from ring</strong>: Whomsoever chances upon these rings
will probably hear the last recorded voice of civilized man. This is the
year four thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>another voice from ring</strong>: This is the last day. We,
the last to survive, have had our final meeting. We have decided to
split into two groups. Each man and woman has made his own decision.
Some have chosen to take refuge in the great caverns and find a new way
of life far down below the earth’s surface. The rest of us have decided
to take our chances in the sunlight, small as those chances may be.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: From the talking rings I
learned how the human race divided itself and how the world of the Eloi
and Morlocks began.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: By some quirk of fate the
Morlocks had become the masters and the Eloi their servants. The
Morlocks main- tained them and bred them like cattle only to take them
below when they reached maturity, which explained why there were no
older people along them.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Now I knew I must go below.
It was the only means of finding a way up into the sphinx to reach my
Machine and to find out what happened to the little people when they
went below.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: No…don’t go…please.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: You will not come back.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p>****: During the above and throughout the follow-</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Weena! Where are you, Girl?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What’s happening? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What do you mean, all clear?</p>
<p><strong>man in white</strong>: Yes, the rings have told us that
story.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: But you didn’t listen. You didn’t
learn anything. All that is left is fear…a blind animal fear. Ages ago
men were taught to hide in the ground when the sirens blew… taught to
run from a raining death… but those men are dead! And so are the men who
slaughtered them. Don’t you understand? You are slaves of a dead past…
You don’t even own your souls. You’re led to slaughter like sheep!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: What about those who went below? How
are they to come back?</p>
<p><strong>man in white</strong>: They never come back. Nobody can bring
them back.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: You can try. Won’t any of you even
try?</p>
<p>****: DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF</p>
<p><strong>t.t.’s voice</strong>: So, this was the destiny of the
Eloi.</p>
<p><strong>t.t.’s voice</strong>: They were being bred like cattle by
the Morlocks who had degenerated into the lowest form of human
life…cannibalism.</p>
<p><strong>t.t.</strong>: Weena!</p>
<p><strong>t.t.</strong>: Girl! Come to your senses! All of you!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Quick, something to burn! It’s my
last match!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Weena! Weena, get the torch!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Weena! Go on! Go on the steps!</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: The underworld of the
Morlocks was gone…and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: From now on they would have
to work to survive. And looking at their faces, I somehow knew that they
could start over again.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: Another night was coming,
but this night no Eloi needed to fear.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller’s voice</strong>: But what of me? - I was
imprisoned in a world in which I did not belong.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Are you sorry?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Sorry? - Sorry for what?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: That you have to stay.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Yes. - I am sorry because I could
tell so much to the people of my own time… I could tell them about the
happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them. They could learn
from it…or would they?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: You don’t want to stay, do you?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: It isn’t that, but I don’t fit here
anymore than you would in my time.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: I would like to see your time.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: No, Girl, you wouldn’t be very happy
there.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Do you have someone like me - there?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: No. No one like you. But there are
friends who will miss me. - As a matter of fact, I’m probably late
already.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Women?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: No, men. There is a woman too, of
course! She looks after my house for me. She is sixty-two years old. -
Much older than you are.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: How do they wear their hair?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: The women in your time.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Up!</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Up? - How?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>weena</strong>: Would I be pretty?</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Yes…you would be. More than pretty.
I wish we could go back together, Weena, back to my own time…or to times
before that when the world was young. We could…</p>

<p><strong>explosions, rumbling etc. in reverse</strong>: AND SPEEDED UP
join the HUMMING of the Time Machine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: It is ridiculous! Simply
preposterous!</p>
<p><strong>bridewell</strong>: Well, there’s one thing I’ll say for you,
George. You always could tell a good story. Best adventure yarn I’ve
heard for years. You’re a truly fine inventor, George!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: I’ll turn down your bed for you!</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: Truthfully, where have you been for the past
week?</p>
<p><strong>bridewell</strong>: Now, we shouldn’t ask such questions,
Walter. It’s not hard for a man to lose a week now and then.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: I don’t think I can.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hillyer</strong>: Are you coming, Kemp.</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: It’s getting late and you look exhausted. You
had better get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Goodnight, George.</p>
<p><strong>time traveller</strong>: Thank you, David, for being such a
good friend - always.</p>
<p><strong>kemp</strong>: What do you think, Filby?</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Look, you chaps go on. It’s just a short walk
home for me.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: George!…</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: I think I understand. - Look!</p>
<p><strong>the theme</strong>: “The Land Of The Leal”.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: But it isn’t like George. - To return empty
handed. To try to rebuild a civilization without a plan. He must have
taken something with him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: Nothing except three books.</p>
<p><strong>filby</strong>: Which three books?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: I don’t know. – Is it important?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watchett</strong>: Mr. Filby, do you think he will ever
return?</p>
