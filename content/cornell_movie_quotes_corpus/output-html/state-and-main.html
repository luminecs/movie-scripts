<p><strong>morris</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Yes, I hear it.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Drive a man to drink. Took me near half
an-hour, get across the street yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of
the building. Said, “What are you doin’?” He said, “I’m waitin’ for the
’leven o’clock crossing…”</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Y’wanna fix something, you should fix the
pothole. Yessir, they should be trussed up, thrown off some high
building.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Whoever spent ten, f’teen thousand dollars,
a new traffic light, you could grow old, paint your house before it lets
you cross the street, and then, not fix the pothole.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: What was wrong with the old traffic light?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m glad you asked… I’ll tell you what was
wrong with it. And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times.
Now: You want to bring business into this town? You have to plan for a
Waterford that Does Not Exist. Not at the moment, no…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Morning, darling.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hi, Annie.</p>

<p><strong>doug</strong>: They are, yes. I’m sure they are…</p>
<p><strong>woman at counter</strong>: Annie, I’m going to be a lil’ late
for the rehearsal, tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: S’Okay, Maude. You know your lines…?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: …I’m sure that people are upset…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I know ’em, I don’t know what order they come
in…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: We’ll work it out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’re they talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Traffic light.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Waal, no, th’traffic light’s Doug’s thing.
That’s his thing, fine.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thank you, Jack, and…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But we got to talk about the pothole.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A public office is a public trust… This is why
this is America. Question is: who owns the street.</p>
<p><strong>townsman</strong>: Doc, those pills, y’gave me for my back?
I’m not sure that they work.</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: Well, I’m not sure either, but y’don’t
hear me complain… come by th’office, end of th’afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>townsman</strong>: Thanks, Doc…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This is your movie, this is small town
America.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Town in New Hampshire was small town America,
too. Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street. And then they
kicked us out…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: A jacket for five dollars… I can buy this town
for fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You told me that about the last town.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, but they never made a movie here.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m bleeding, Bill, I’m bleeding…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What, what, what, what do they got that can
pass for the Old Mill?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: “The Waterford Mill, built in 1825, and long a
tourist attraction…” Wake up Uberto</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Givvem a cigarette…</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: …they ship our Old Mill from New
Hampshire?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They’re holding our Old Mill for ransom.</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: We build it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We don’t have to build it.</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: We build the fire hut?</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: We have to lose the window.</p>

push in – I can’t push in through the window… we go back to New
Hampshire?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: NO, we can’t ever go back to New
Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: NO, we’re gonna stay here. This is what my
people died for. The right to make a movie in this town.</p>

<p><strong>walt</strong>: …you got to get me that street for
nothing…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Waterford, Vermont. Where is it? That’s where
it is…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Because, because…we don’t have to build an Old
Mill. They have an Old Mill. Yeah. It’s on a stream – that’s where you
put a mill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …they run on water.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Now: I’m looking at the…</p>

<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’re doing a play…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Local Drama Group. Northern Books. No, it
hasn’t come in yet. As soon as it does. Yup, you too, Marge.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …small town. I suppose. You have to make your
own fun.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Everybody makes their own fun. F’you don’t make
it yourself, it ain’t fun, it’s entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Northern Books. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I need a</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: We got ’em. North…No, Henry James was the
novelist, Frank James was the criminal. Yep, you came to the right
place. Jessie James was the Brother. Of the novelist. That’s right.
That’s alright, Susie. See you tomorrow, Susie.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I want to rent this one.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Why don’t you buy it, only forty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I have one, but they lost it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The people in New Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s why they have state borders… whyn’t you
get a replacement?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, it had sentimental value.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You buy the typewriter, I’ll get it all spruced
up, good as new. Better than new. It has some history.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Other one has history, too. I wrote my play on
it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You wrote a play on it? What play is that?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You haven’t heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “Anguish.”</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: “Anguish” by Joseph Turner White…?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You’re Joseph Turner White?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Afternoon, Ann.</p>

<p><strong>maude</strong>: That a fact. Now, is it a good play?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes, Maude, it is. It is a very good play.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, then, what’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Writing the movie.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: You’re writing a movie…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s about the quest for purity.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: …because he wouldn’t say that: Look: “Sister,
I’ve just come from a fire. There’s some things I want to think out…”
now, come one, come on… “Leave me alone.” a gesture…? Alright?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Page…three. Now: “It’s a nice evening.” I’m not
gonna say that…“It’s a nice…”</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hey, Joe…Good. You know B…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I grew up on your mov…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you mind if we don’t go through the usual
bullshit about how I loved it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I mean, okay, fine, but it’s a motion
Picture.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Thanks, honey, but next time, bring two, save
yourself a trip.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The people came to see a motion Picture. Hold
on…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: He’s saying, what are you saying, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Tell it with…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Tell it with pictures.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Tell it with pictures. What I’m saying…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: We’ve got four days to…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You look at: girl comes in the room, an apron,
a brown bag, what is she…? She’s a…?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: She’s a…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: She’s a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What I…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hold on. What Bob is saying, you don’t
need…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You don’t need, “Hi, I’ve just come from the
restaurant.”</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You can go…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Alright: Let’s Page five, the fucking horse
dies. You know, she could be in the movie, she could, she’s got a good
face, she could be the Doctor’s…uh, why does it have to be his, uh,
wife…? It could be his…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, you’re absolutely…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And you go start with that stuff in this
town…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Everybody needs a hobby. Okay, look Page…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Claire, when did you…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I just…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Claire, Bob Bar…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No, I was, I was, I was just learning on,
it’s a…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How’d you like working with Richard Hill?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I loved it, he…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Isn’t he…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: We’re just talking about the…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Don’t let me dis…I’ll just…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, no…please…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m looking at Page Five: “It’s…”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “It’s a nice evening…”</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: This is Joe White.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: How can I thank you? How can I repay you for
this part? It’s a… what a, thank you for this part. The first scene at
the Old Mill…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Joe’s been having some thoughts about the Old
Mill Scene, Claire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What, what’s there to think about? The
scene’s perfect…I, I get to say…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yes, but, Joe, Joe’s been, well, he’s just
been having a few, uh, “thoughts,” about…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: How many times in your life do you get a
speech like that?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This scene is why I’m doing the movie. “Look
at the mill, Frank – look at the way it goes around…half of the time the
darned wheel’s under water, but…”</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yes, yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: “…but still it rises up. It rises up, Frank,
high as it can go.”</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah. Joe? Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh,
the “thoughts” you’ve been…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: All ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So young, so unlined, so full of promise. So
innocent.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I quit.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You quit.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I quit the movie.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Why did you quit?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Actually, I’m not sure if I quit. I think that
I got fired. I’m such a liar. I never could tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Don’t be so hard on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I just got kicked off my first movie.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well. Everybody has reversals. If you were
never down how would you know when you were up?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s good. That’s really good. You have a
gift for words.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s in your play.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You like my play.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s about life.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Could you tell me when’s the next train?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: N’about ten minutes. What was your movie
about?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, of course, you don’t want to talk about
it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s about a man who gets a second chance.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Evening, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Evening, Cal. Would you tell me about it?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, of course, you want to get out of town.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Evening, Annie. See you at rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You know your line?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: “Rise, one need not bend the knee before the
throne of justice.”</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Go you Huskies.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They leave it out all night?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Not worth stealing. Only thing in town worth
something. Stained glass window.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ever wonder why the dalmation’s the symbol of
the firehouse?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: First organized fire department was on the
border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But why the dalmation?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It was either that, or a sardine.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You get what you pay for.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s true. You grow up here?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Central High, ‘n’ matinees, the Bijou
Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Nice town.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …that…that he prayed for a second chance.
But…do you see?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That, he says, there are no second chances…that
he’s been presented what he prayed for…and: he’s ruined it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But, but but but…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, no, I see…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That: in an act of…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Of mercy…off…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I understand…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …that…he sees that…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: As the Old Mill goes around…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Of course, of course that’s what I’m saying. As
the Old Mill goes around, he sees…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …that it has been vouchsafed to him.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s that’s that’s that’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And you’re the only one who’ll ever hear that
speech. Just you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well. It was a pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And likewise.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Next train in’nt for two hours.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill
represents…the wheel of fate is that too…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, no. Of course, that’s exactly what it
represents.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That whole…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The, the, the, the sanctity of everyday
things…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Everyday things…yes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: For example, he’s just come back from a fire
and he…um… That’s a fine house. You look at that, and you know, there’s
nice people that live there.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I live there.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Really. With the porch swing and
everything…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Surest thing you know.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t mean to impose, but…do you think we
might…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s what the swing is there fore…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …that’s what the swing is there fore…that its
purpose, isn’t it…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …I always thought so…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …such a pleasant sound.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Cause, cause, it’s…it’s the simple things
that…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …that.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some News
for you…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this,
this is my fiance, Doug Mac…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Sa pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Guess who is THIS CLOSE to a nomination to
State Senate…which is this close to one stop from Congress!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …who…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, I guess I’ll…get down to the station. It
was lovely meeting…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mister White is…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Nice meeting you…they were, let me tell you,
they were a bit coy at first, I told them: Look: the people are tired,
they’re going to vote their pocketbook, yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What happened in 1973?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t run off. Don’t run off, we need you. You
know why? You’re why we’re here. Your script is why we’re here… Gimme
that. Big deal. We fight a little bit? You show me a family that
doesn’t. But we got something special. What is it? We’re here to make a
movie. Can’t use the Old Mill. Well, that happens. What you got to do,
you find the essence - what was it, that brought us here. It wasn’t a
building, Joe, it was an idea. It was an essence - what is the essence
of your story? Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s about a man who gets a second chance.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Then, you write that. And then this is our
second chance. That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I want to make a good film.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know you do.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And maybe it will be a better movie without the
old mill, I…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hey, it’s with the G-ds. We don’t have the
money, we have to write it out. The best or not. And that’s a lesson.
You get your typewriter yet?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Um, no.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Grace, get on the other phone. Call that girl:
well, call her, and have whatsername send up some nosh…what do you like
to drink…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Did my matzohs come? Get some for everybody.
Thank you. Lemme tell you about my first movie…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What, what what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look at this. Do you know what they’re
offering? Look at this. They treat us like we’re their backyard. Do you
know what they’re offering for three days to close down Main Street?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What are they offering?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s so beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: “The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is
not destroyed. Although it is altered…”</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure, but… ten thousand dollars. Do you know
what they… this movie is budgeted at fifty million dol…they’re coming up
here, offer us a meal…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: …not the Lazyboy…</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Hi, Sherry…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: …put it in the living room. And we have
thirteen at the table.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: …we don’t have thirteen at table…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the
director…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Waal, then, invite someone else, then…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: I don’t want to invite someone else because
this is the most exclusive…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would
make you happy. Sher. This is your party, and whatever…</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Hi Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Cal. I want a city council meeting.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: …little woman has gone crazy about our dinner
party… City Council? What’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Main Street.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Doug, the traffic light…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Fuck the traffic light. I’m talking about
three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What are you doing? I love your script.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They decided, I decided to, to…you love
what?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You’re still here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I…I decided to give it another ch…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I love your script.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>postman</strong>: Mornin’, Annie…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: See you at rehearsal tonight?</p>
<p><strong>postman</strong>: “In the name of justice, sir, I bid you
pause; for she is our Queen…”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: In fact, in fact, in fact, I’m not sure if I’m
giving them a second chance, or they’re giving it to me. That’s the
truth. The truth’s best, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You’d know better’n me.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How can you say that?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s in your script…it’s about getting a second
chance. Innit? “You can go back…”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I can?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You bet your life. “The mill wheel goes
around…some times it’s even under water – then it rises up, as high as
it can go…”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But how do I…how do I do a film called “The Old
Mill” when I don’t have an old mill?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, first, you got to change the title.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, he doesn’t want to work out with Waterford
Huskies…Because he’s Bob Barrenger…Call up his girl in Aspen, have ’em
ship his weight…Yeah, well, fine, he’s not gonna do the Pond scene
unless he can work out. Call up his girl in Aspen, and have her ship the
weights out…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Who designed these costumes? Who designed
these costumes? It looks like Edith Head puked and that puke designed
these costumes. Get Madge.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Your wife is on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I have no wife.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: We need a new name for the movie. Where’s the
writer?</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: Wally, I got to takes out the window from
the dog. I can’t shoot through…</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: …Claire’s got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: Wally, if I hafes a moment of your time,
look at these storyboards. THIS SHOOT, I can’t shoot this shot, you
want.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: Because they gots a window with a dogs in
it. You want me to “push in.” Or can I lose the shot.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No you can’t lose the shot. The meaning of the
film is in that shot.</p>
<p><strong>uberto</strong>: But, Wally, the window of the firehut…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t care. Fix it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You show Claire these sketches?</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Did she throw up?</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: That isn’t very nice.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh, really, then why don’t you sue me in the
World Court. Did she like the costumes?</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: I can’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: She won’t stop crying…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Find out when Marty Rossen’s arriving, get him
a bunch of Lilacs to send to the broad.</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: Towns out of Lilacs.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You go in her room, take the Lilacs from the
water, dry them. Go buy some cellophane, wrap ’em up, and get a card
from Marty. What’s her problem?</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: She doesn’t want to bare her
breasts.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: She doesn’t want to bare her breasts…what, in
the “nude scene?” What are we paying her three mil for?</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: She’s got “religion.”</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Her religion bars her from fulfilling her
contr…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Claire?…Claire? Just figure out how to take
the shot. Claire…Claire? It’s Wally. May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What is it, Pal…?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I can’t do it, Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You can’t do what?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It isn’t right. I can’t…I…I know I si…I,
they, I don’t know if they told me it was in the con…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Forget the contract. Claire. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t want to take my shirt off in that
con…what are these things that they’re asking of me…? Wha…wha… wha… I
try to be good. The only thing I care about is…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know that…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Is…is the MOVIE!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know that, Claire. I, we all know…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Everybody, they, they, they treat me like
a…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …no, they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …they treat me like a child. I, I…to bare my
body.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Now, look. Claire: Listen to me. I want to
tell you a story.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Fuck flowers, we aren’t talking about flowers,
we’re talking about a human being.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Who are these from?</p>
<p><strong>prod. asst.</strong>: Marty.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well that’s very thoughtful of him. Elanora
Duse…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …I can’t do it, Wally…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Listen to me. Elanora Duse was playing Hamlet
in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket. She said, “I’m
not doing the seven shows a week I signed for.” She said, “I cannot bare
my soul seven times a week. I am an artist. I’ll do four shows a week.”
The greatest actress of her time. You know what her Producer said?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Nothing. He held her and he wept. Because
he…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Because he understood. That was her life’s
blood on the stage.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …I know…I know…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …and, and, and did she? And she did the
seven shows?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, she didn’t Claire. But I think you should
do the scene.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Wally…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know, it’s the hardest thing in the world.
And it seems everybody wants…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …wants a piece…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And you know what?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We, we have to give it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …and my heart goes out to you, because I
know…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That, that’s your life’s blood on the st…</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: I don’t know what she’s bitching about,
she’s flashed her tits in the last five movies, she’d bare her breasts
to do voice over.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell
him she’s breaking her contract and we’re very up…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: We’re very upset with her. Get someone to
double for her, her tits, the tits scene. Call L.A. I want to see some
pictures of the women’s tits. Of their tits.</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: I’m very sorry I…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You’re very sorry, you passive aggressive,
son-of-a-bitch! Can we replace him?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We start shooting in three days.</p>
<p><strong>costume designer</strong>: You want to see the fireman’s
costumes? Cause I found this Moleskin for the collar, it’s not black,
but it looks black… it’s not brown, but…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Marty Rossen’s touched down.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What I need to say…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: About conflict…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s why you didn’t want to take the Mill
out…you’ve…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …the, the, the symbol of the fire…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: The Firehouse…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: But but but but but it’s better without…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How…?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Wait wait wait wait wait he get’s a second
chance, do you see? And you get a second chance!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: He doesn’t go back to the mill, he gets a
second chance to go back to the firehouse…</p>

<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh. What were you doing, then, that’s so
important that you shouldn’t call your fian…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s all over between us, Doug, I’m sorry, but
that’s the truth. I’ve found someone else, and, it’s very serious and
it’s the end. I’m sorry. It isn’t you, j…</p>

<p><strong>ann</strong>: You have to sign for it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I’m gonna be your typist for this evening.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh, G-d…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: And here’s some hydrogen peroxide…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s for your finger.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: One moment.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You have to hide.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s my…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Will you help me out…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You going to ask me in?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Thought you might like this.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Read the card.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “To the love of my life, Love, Doug.”</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: The other side.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Don’t you think you should put them in
water.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …because if you don’t, they die.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Shouldn’t we start?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Start? This isn’t a good time.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh. That’s alright. Then I’ll come back at a
better time. What would be a better time.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Later on.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Then I’ll come back, then.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You, um, you, um, you going out with your
fiance?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, I just broke up with him. I’ll see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It occurred to me, you’d wanna have this: sort
of a memento of our…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hi. I hope I’m not disturbing…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: She came in here, wait, she…I was giving her a
massage…wait…wait! She came in here…she… …with respect…she took off her
clothes, and she got in bed, I told her I could not – we don’t know each
other, you see…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We had a script conference.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I told her thank you very much, but it was
inconvenient because, uh, because…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Because I’d met someone else.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I do if you do.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But it’s absurd.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: So is our electoral process. But we still
vote.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Do you truly believe the electoral process is
absurd?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I used to go out with a politician.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You used to go out with him, you broke up with
him?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sure did.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Time for a change. Keep your margins
straight.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Go you Huskies!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: And don’t you worry about that permit…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Why, that’s right fine…</p>

<p><strong>painter</strong>: Morning, Mrs. Baily, Mista Bailey…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: I’ve got two days to get this house…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the
producer.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: I am so glad to meet you. We are so glad to
have you here, and welcome you to our…I, you know, they had c… I’m,
yearly I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: The house, the 1835. The original kitchen,
of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: A spate of suspicious fires which were in
fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: My oh my.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: I’m…Tuesday evening we’re having an informal
dinner, I didn’t know you’d be ‘on set,’ but if you’d like to join
your…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Doug, this is Mr…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Oh, how thoughtless of me. Would you like a
cup of tea…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: …he’s the producer of the movie.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I want you to hear this, pal… Forget the
overages, forget Ten Thousand Dollars, for three days to two weeks. You
know what it would cost for them to build this set? Two Million Dollars!
Now:</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Doug…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Now: The Waterford Merchant’s Association, of
who I am Council…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re out of Wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: I told you, we could have it by
Wednesday…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Wednesday, don’t tell me Wednesday, the
biggest grossing box office star in the world is coming for dinner
Tuesday…</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Waal, if you ordered something common…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Something common? I’m going to give you
something common. I’m going to give you an injunction, is what I…Mister
Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Huh. Well, the Waterford Merchant’s
Association demands, through me as their council, five percent of the
profits of the movie, as figured by and… geared to the most favorable
definition the Producer…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Why, you little sheeny…</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: “Assembly of Death” did 95 million dollars
the first weekend.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Waal, what was the per-screen average…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Cuppa coffee, and a…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: With you inna moment. I’m a little
short-handed.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Where’s Carla?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Hiya, Annie…</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Annie, sorry I ain’t been to a meetin’ of
the Drama Club…</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Oh, good…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Good morning to you…whatsa matter?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I can’t get it to come out right.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s the scene…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It used to be the Old Mill.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’ve you got?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They meet on Main Street. Her horse has just
died. He’s coming from the fire.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Annie, you want something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s the scene about…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s good to see you, too…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Annie?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What about…what about…it’s so presumptuous of
me, to be, to be telling you how to wr…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes
the soot from his eyes. He goes up to her. “What happened to the horse?”
She looks at him. She takes his hand…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ah, ah, ah…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: What happened to his finger?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It was burnt.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: And then it was really hurt.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ah, ah, ah. That’s what she says, that’s what
she says. He says, “Sister, I’ve come from a fire…” But she, but she,
she says it was not the fire which hurt you…it…</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: …how was it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …he stuck a fishhook in it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: She realizes – it was not the fire which hurt
him…that the true hurt was her. Was her…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …her unbridled sexuality. That he…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Has been wounded by her heat…by her
infidelities…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anybody here seen Carla?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Because, because, because if it’s about purity,
it’s…it’s…and then, then, you don’t need the nude scene.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Because it’s about purity…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s…that’s exactly what it’s about.
Take…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …take any two people…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …anybody seen my daughter…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …take you and me…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …the finest people you could ever hope to work
with… You have the new Old Mill pages?</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: I can’t find the writer.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …totally false…totally false. He is the, I
would say the most responsible human being I have ever…</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: I have to talk to you. My wife…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: My wife is going to have a baby,
and…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh, that’s great. Let’s bring more people into
this overcrowded world.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Take it off. Take that stupid fucking shirt
off right now. Well, if I had to say one thing, I would say it’s
purity.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Not now, I’m talking to the press. Claire!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What? I have a five-o’clock plane to
catch.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I, uh… I’ve always thought so… Well, you just
get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial
form. I’ve written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting… Bill:
get a copy of that letter…! I just wanted to tell you that I am past
chagrined, I’m mortified at the way you were spoken to…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: An artist of your caliber…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m only trying to…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know what you are, I am so sorry that
you…when I read that script I said there’s only one person to play that
part.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: The minute I read that script I said…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …she works with animals, she…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …yes…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …she has a home…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …I know, I’m so…because I said: yes, a woman
who…the…the community respects her. Please don’t go. Please don’t go.
What can I do but beseech you…? Trauma, toil…when are we free of them…?
When…?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He treated me as if I were a child…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Claire: As an interpretive artist to a
creative artist: Stay with me. I need you. We start to shoot tomorrow
and then it belongs to us. Stay. Stay. Tonight…when… When they’ve gone.

<p><strong>ann</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: One moment…</p>

<p><strong>talking to you, you two bit speedtrap</strong>: FRAUD:
There’s an old saying, two scariest things in the world, a black man
with a knife and a Jew with a lawyer. Now, I am a lawyer, and I am the
Jew, and you continue ONE MOMENT with this slanderous shit here in this
public place, I’m going to have your ass over my mantleplace. THE KID
WAS NOT IN</p>
<p><strong>you know it. so i’m not paying patsy</strong>: WITH YOU HERE,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER. Look in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks last year
and I don’t like being trifled with. Now I think that the better part of
valor, though we’ve got your back up here…the better part of valor is to
step away. Or, before G-d, I will see you disbarred. Now, what do you
think? We all have a movie to make. Now, can we stay together here…?
What do you say? Have a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s a mistake. It’s all over. I’m sorry that
we’ve inconvenienced you.</p>

<p><strong>marty</strong>: And a fantasy object…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tell him to get dressed…</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Uh, sir…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Wally?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Look, Carla, this is a hard time for you. Many
young people go to Hollywood. I did…and we all dream of it, and here,
here Hollywood has come to you.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Mr. Barrenger, I’m very sorry, but…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Here this dream world has come to you. Now,
you obviously have an active, a vivid imagination.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Her…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I swear that that woman in my room…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Be quiet, Bob. A fertile mind. Now we can use
that kind of people in our work. Yes, we can. Now, and this is what
occurs to me… There’s a part in the film…isn’t that right, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That we could use you in and I think that’s
quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody
good.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Here it is: Statutory r…blah, blah, blah,
blah… “statutory”… “unsupported testimony by the…” Hold on, Bobby.
You’ve got nothing and you know it. By G-d, you know it. Harassment. You
need a… even if this was true, you need a witness. You need someone puts
her in the car. And you’ve got nothing. Now we all have…yes, give her
that part in the film. Yes, we’d love to have you… Now: we all have more
important things to do, isn’t that right…?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Isn’t that right? I’m sorry that you all went
to this…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I knew she wasn’t in the car.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: This has been just an unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yes? Hello, Mr. Mayor. Nothing, just an, an
unfortunate… It’s the Mayor, he’s saying…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Is he cool or angry?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Well, these things happen. Purpose of my
call, my wife wanted to know what brand of cigarettes Mr. Barrenger
smokes, so she could lay some out tonight…we got the list of his dietary
requirements…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So we just got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Marty, it’s Howie Gold on the coast. He needs
your confirmation on a request for money…?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: If your memory was as long as your dick, you’d
be in good shape. How long since you almost went to jail for this
shit?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How could she turn on me like that? I thought
she liked me.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get
out of this town in one piece?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m ready!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Stay ready. Stay by yourself in your room.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’ll I do for fun?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Whyn’t you learn your lines?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know my lines…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You do…?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I just don’t know what order they come in…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I tell you what, let’s ditch these cockamamie
locals. I need to get outta here. Go to some roadhouse tonight, just us.

have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I
may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I
got rape, I got collusion…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You’ve got nothing, you don’t have a
witness…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And I’ve got a witness! Your Mr. White saw the
crime.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: He told you that!?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: He didn’t have to tell.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I want to talk to him. Would you ex…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, you’re his attorney, too?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Later for you, pal.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Bobby, don’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’ll see about that at the inquest.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, hi, pal. I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What is it all about?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I saw…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How do they know that, you told them?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What did you say to them?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I didn’t say anything to them.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How do you know you saw it?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, then, you didn’t see it, right?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You didn’t see it…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I…? I saw it. I was there.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You were there. At…at 10:35…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I was walking down the street…I remember, I was
writing a…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What glasses were you wearing? Were you
wearing your reading glasses?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You told me you were writing. Don’t you wear
your reading glasses to write…?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’ve got to go to the jail.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …he’s going to give you a couple of
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You got to tell ’em that you saw the accident.
Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I can’t do that. If I tell them, they’ll, if I
tell them, they’ll try Bob for rape, they’ll… it’ll ruin his career…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: But that’s what happened.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But it’ll stop the movie.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Maybe they’ll be other movies.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They’ll…they’ll blackball me.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Carla was in the car, right?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I…I think that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: …you think that’s right…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’m I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Lotta hubbub on the street. I’m taking you the
back way.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Let’s speak English. You’ve got to help the
side.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You want me to lie.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: To the contrary. I want you to tell the truth.
The truth is, you can’t tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.
You don’t remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on. And
you have a fertile imagination. Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.
Now. IF you aren’t sure, then they have nothing. Bob walks free. As he
should. Joe: wasn’t long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a
stake through their heart, you know? The people who are talking to you
about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they
fear us. Because we tell the truth. About our lives. Now, this is a damn
roost, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to
make a name for himself…If we let him do that, if we let him do that,
then we’re being false to our community…to our community, you
understand? To our world. Cause you are a part of that world, now. You
have to take off the steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex. And be part
of your world. I got a five picture deal with the studio. And you stick
with me. You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you’ll direct
the third one. You are a part of this world. You have to do the right
thing: we’re out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our
door. You have to stand with the troops, Joe. That’s the bottom line.
You have to…if you had the leisure to think it through, you’d see it for
yourself. The girl wasn’t in the car.</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: …Joseph Turner White…</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Hear ye, hear ye. Sixth District Court. And
for the county of Kadona, State of Vermont, the honorable James Addison
Flynn presiding. All those having business before this court, draw
forward and you will be heard.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please…Mr. White? This is a simple matter
of…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Uh huh, all we need’s a simple fact or
to…you’re going to give your recollection of the accident last evening,
at the corner, State and Main. Would you please swear him in.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Do you swear to tell the truth…</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: …the arraignment, as we said of Bob
Barrenger, The Bob Barrenger, star of “The Old Mill,” about to begin
shooting here, in picaresque and sleepy… we should say, formerly
sleepy…Yes, yes, it’s…yes, it’s Claire Wellesley, and we’re going to try
to get a look at…</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: They need those rewrites on the “Old Mill”
scene…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …about his personal life, though I can tell
you a few things about…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Would you please hold all calls to my room?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Though I can tell you a few things about his
dietary requirements.</p>
<p><strong>kid on scooter</strong>: Mornin’, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: Mornin’, Billy, where ya goin’ in such a
hurry?</p>
<p><strong>kid on scooter</strong>: Down the corner, see the ruckus…</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: Watch the curbs, now…</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: Where you off to?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I, uh…I’m leaving…</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I perjured myself. I told a lie, and I ruined
my life. That’s what I did. I don’t suppose you could help me with that,
could you? Turn back the clock, or something? Give me back my, give me
back my purity, I don’t suppose you could just wave your magic wand and
do that, could you? But what is truth? Eh? Ain’t that the thing? What is
true?</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: It’s the truth that you should never
trust anybody, wears a bowtie. Cravat’s s’posed to point down to
accentuate the genitals, why’d you wanna trust somebody, s’tie points
out to accentuate his ears?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Aren’t you supposed to set an example for
people?</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: Nope. I’m just supposed to hold people’s
hands while they die. What’d you say your problem was?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I just swore my life away, back in that…</p>
<p><strong>doc wilson</strong>: Mornin’, Chessy, how’s the back?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I ruined my life. Isn’t that funny, that you
can actually do it in one moment just like they say. I ruined my life
back in that courthouse.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: What courthouse?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Courthouse back in town.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Town ain’t got no courthouse.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Ain’t got no courthouse. Courthouse burnt
down, 1960.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, where do they hold court?</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Hold court, they have to, science lab, the
high school.</p>
<p><strong>station master</strong>: Mornin’, judge, what brings you
here?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m s’posed to hear some deposition, some
fool saw the accident last night.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …the courthouse burnt down…?</p>
<p><strong>station master</strong>: Yep. Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Part of a spate of fires, Old Mill, Courthouse… S’posed to’ve been set
by some deranged teenager.</p>
<p><strong>station master</strong>: Yep, never did discover who set
’em…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I thought you needed to get it out of your
system.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: …a blight, a blight and an obscenity…that’s
good English, isn’t it? How’s that for entertainment?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m going to tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: …and to exterminate this vermin, yes, I use
that term, who have abused, who have desecrated, yes, the license
granted to them by a gracious nation…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: …who spew filth and degradation…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: …thank you…</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: …you want to clean up?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Five minutes, and we’re going live to
the network.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: …foreign, and un-American perversions of the
Democratic process. By those we have entrusted with our dreams…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Do something.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You tell me what to do, I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …and I was just paying off my house in
Malibu…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Thank G-d, it’s up to you, Pal. Sup to
you…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t getcha.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The girl was in the car.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I treated you like a son or nephew.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s no you, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I have to tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: …that’s just so narrow…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The girl was in the car.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Then you’re finished in show business.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So be it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And my company sues your ass for sixty million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: For what cause?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t need a cause, just a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: I’m a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Howie…</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: What am I doing here is I just flew seven
hours cause you asked me here.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: For this…I hope you need it, cause it’s
coming outta your budget…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’d prefer it if you didn’t speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: …you know, there’s nothing you could say, that
could possibly make a difference, so, why don’t you just save your
breath…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s in the case?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Eight-hundred thousand dollars in cash.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And what was it you wanted to say?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Gut Yuntif.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’ve come to give myself up…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Well give yourself up to someone else. I’m
gonna get in some golf. Hiya, Annie. Give yourself up to her.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I have learned a lesson. And the lesson is
this…that everybody needs a second chance. You, me, and these fine, film
people here. You know, they have a high profile, but that doesn’t mean
they aren’t deserving of our trust, and of our respect. You know, I
think there is a lesson here, and the lesson is this: it is a lesson of
Tolerance…and, as we look at this industry, at this clean, American
industry, and as I begin my campaign for congress…</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: Okay. Are we getting set up here…are we
getting set up…People…? Can we settle…can we settle now…?</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: Okay, this is picture…</p>

<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sister, I’ve just come from a fire…</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: …to come by next Sunday, and we’ll give you
a second chance.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Only second chance I know, chance t’make the
same mistake twice.</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: Well, time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>first a.d.</strong>: That’s a cut!</p>
<p><strong>cal</strong>: Mom’s expecting you for dinner tonight.</p>
