<h1 id="soldier">soldier</h1>
<p><strong>revised draft</strong>: October 2, 1997</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Colonel Mekum has his “boys” unpacked. I
think he wants to show them off.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Hmmmmph.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: They look…impressive.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Well, they’re…pretty.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: What’s so hot about them?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Very much improved. In every way.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: This is Colonel Mekum from Q. He’s their
commanding officer.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Improved…how?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: As I said, in every way. Physically and
psychologically. More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye,
improved technical training. Where the First Psychology gave you
ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Mmmmmm. Weeell, you know my old daddy was in
maintenance and he had a saying…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: …He used to say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t
fix it.”</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: I…see. I’m not sure I quite get
your…point…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Well, the soldiers we’ve got now, they’ve
been through all kinds of heavy shit…and they’ve always got the job
done. Now these new ones, these “hot shots” of yours…what kind of action
have they seen? They are battle-tested, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: That’s up to you field guys. H.Q. wants you
to break ’em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: The sweep is just routine, not even police
action. I’d like to see some sort of…meaningful evidence…</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Maybe we could run some tests. Kind of a
comparison, the old and the new…</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Very nice, Riley. Fall away.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Thirty seconds, 90 percent hits.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Let’s make it more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Caine Six-Oh-Seven!</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Assemble the weapon, load, fire on the target
from various evasive positions in a thirty-second period.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Starting…now!</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: As you were, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Ninety-nine percent…</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: While taking evasive action…</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: That’s…very good.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: See? Much stronger.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: What about endurance?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Our man has been out there fifteen minutes
now. Shouldn’t you send one?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: In a minute. Now, see this test? This shows
what they do under sleep deprivation conditions. Forty-eight hours awake
and they can…</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Melton, Eight Five. Forward.</p>
<p><strong>melton</strong>: Eight Five, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Ten miles, Melton, on the run.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: You’ve got sixty minutes. Go.</p>
<p><strong>melton</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: My man left exactly twenty minutes after
yours. Make a note of that.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: What are we supposed to do with the old
soldiers?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Old soldiers never die.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: They’ll serve as a labor force. You can use
them for physical stuff… loading, unloading, repairs, power lines, that
kind of thing. Even cleaning…sweeping…,uh, tidying up.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Of course, age is a factor, but the real
factor is the training program, especially the psychological. The mind
controls the body after all, and we’re doing wonderful things with the
mind.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: At ease, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: What’s the price of all that speed? Is he
tired?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Tired?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Todd here ran the pace he’s been taught to
run. He’s still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Soldier! Up the chain!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Melton, on the double! Up a chain!</p>
<p><strong>melton</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: What about…spirit?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Spirit? Oh! You mean “AQ”…“aggressive
qualities”?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Whatever the latest jargon is.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Much better, much higher. For example, where
your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in
aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without
sexual inclination. It’s all aggression.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Real men!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: At ease, Lieutenant. What if they
fought?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: You mean up there?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Go ahead, Rube. Tell Todd to take him.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: “No”?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Not fair. No contest. Send two more of your
old ones up.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Romero, A. – Goines, D.L. – up the
chains.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Get him, men!</p>
<p><strong>melton</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: They’re…fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Mmmmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We could have a problem here, couldn’t we? I
mean, we just lost three men…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that. “Training
accident.” Paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What about the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Incinerator.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: They’re very…impressive.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Yeah, well, the big moron shouldn’t have lost
an eye.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: It was our best man who got his eye… Todd, a
real tough one. Survived police action in Montana, fought in the
Argentine Sector, and in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing of –</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Old news! They’re nothing at all! Wait until
you get these new fellas into some real action. I guarantee you’ll be
awed. I guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Please! Quiet, please!</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Just tell me one thing! How many of them are
there and are they armed?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: There in a man…one man. He was found in the
trench by several children…</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: This man was not armed.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: How could there only be one? How could he get
here?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: He was unconscious. We couldn’t ask him
anything. He –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Nothin’ out there. We couldn’t see
nobody, couldn’t see no ship, no vehicles, nothin’…plus the wind’s up
again real strong.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: They’re hiding, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Let’s everybody calm down right now! We
have an injured man among us. One man. A traveler. Unarmed. We all want
to do the decent thing. The decent thing is to help him. Mace’s wife,
Sandra, is looking after him now. Now, I’d like a vote of support on
this course of action from all of you.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: You keep an eye on him, Mace! You watch
him!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Want to try some more of this?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You rest now. I’ll give you more later.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What do you mean he’s survived worse? Did he
say something?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: No, but he’s covered with old wounds, all
sorts of scars. Knife scars, bullet scars, burns.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: A soldier!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: There are words on his shoulder. Tannhauser
Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai 2012…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: The Tannhauser Gate was a battle…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: We’ll have to sleep on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Where’s Nathan?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: If there’s any danger to Nathan –</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I won’t permit danger to Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You must be…you must be feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: We’re teaching the boy to walk.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He’s late learning. He was sick for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Practice with it. In a day or two maybe you’ll
be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I came for Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Let’s go. Come on, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: This way…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You have to watch out for them. They
probably wouldn’t kill someone your size, not if you were healthy
anyway. But they’d make you pretty sick. Someone smaller…like me, or a
child…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: In a month this one will be as big as
those.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Here. You try one.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: You can’t talk to a soldier no more than you
can talk to a…a…bomb! Or a bullet! They’re trained, they’re killing
machines. They got an objective and they go after that objective and
nothing stops them but killing them.</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Just one? To kill us all?</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: First off, if there’s one, there’s more.
That’s how it is, soldiers travel in bunches. Second, they don’t waste
soldiers on folks like us, that’s for police! Training soldiers to kill
weaklings like us is not what they call “cost effective.”</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Then who do they fight?</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Other soldiers! There’s a saying, “Soldiers
deserve soldiers.”</p>
<p><strong>ilona</strong>: Slade, hush up.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: You see how much he’s eating?</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: I don’t see how you can not remember how you
got here, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: You’re not a deserter, are you… Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Then how come you’re not with your unit?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Oh, come on, Slade, let the man eat.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: It’s not an unreasonable question. How about
it, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I was…replaced.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Replaced?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: By a better soldier, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: …And it got worse and worse. My father
hadn’t had any work in three months and…also…there were other
things…violence… political feelings. My father said he’d heard it was
better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the
same idea because the ship was jammed with people…mostly families.
That’s probably why it broke down… overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Even after they made the repairs, it barely
got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of
junk to start with. It just…dropped. Maybe you saw what’s left of it…out
there in the wind. A lot of people died. And we couldn’t make any radio
contact… So we were stuck here. Nobody was happy about it. A few years
later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people
tried to get their attention with explosions and fires. But it didn’t
work. They must be unmanned…or they just don’t care. Maybe they think
we’re garbage too!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: So there really wasn’t any choice. People
had to pull together and make the best of it. We became a…
community.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: One good thing…nobody bothers us. Who’d want
to fight over a godforsaken place like this?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I guess that’s what you like! The fighting,
I mean. The wars. You must…you’re a soldier…</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: You children are supposed to be doing
lessons.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Lessons.</p>
<p><strong>mace’s voice</strong>: She’s down now, but she’ll come up
again. Always does.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: That’s why we’re weighing down. And that’s why
we’re always on the wire even when the wind’s down, like now. You don’t
get much warning. Here, load up, you’ll want the weight, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Oh, we’re not going to shoot anything. That’s
not what we mean by “hunting.” Jimmy Pig, you’re not going to shoot
anything, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: What could I hit?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: It’s how we call for help. Two shots. There’ll
be someone on duty, listening in case we get off the wire and get lost
or something. We have flares too. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Sandra said she told you how we wound up here.
Our parents and so on. Over here, we call these “catcher trenches.”</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Smaller stuff that blows across the ground, it
falls in these trenches, it works sort of like a filter. We go through
the trenches sometimes and get some good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: We try to work ’em when they’re dry. It’s
lousy going in there when they’re flooded. You can see…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Whatever looks useful, if we can get a rope to
it, we’ll go for it. But you can’t ever go further than your safety line
because it’ll come up on you with sometimes maybe ten seconds or even
less.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Like right now. You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: It’s close when you hear that.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Uh, thanks, Sergeant. Thanks a lot…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Dumpers. They come every twenty or thirty
days.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Thanks, partner. These no-goods woulda
just let me blow away.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer
space on Christmas Eve, but I’m off to the Caribbean in a few hours, and
I wanted to make sure you’d got the transmission on the security
sweep.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: We got it all right. This is an outpost
here, not the Third Army! You’ve got us securing thirty-four locations
and erecting monitor units in one month and –</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Piece of cake, guys! These are totally
remote, totally uninhabited territories. All you do is set down, send
out a patrol purely as a formality, then have those veterans of yours
put up an A-Type unmanned monitoring unit. You should be on about number
twenty-five by the time I get back from my vacation…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: What if we do run into people… say squatters
or refugees?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Well, you sure as hell don’t want to get
involved in evacuating people and that sort of thing. My advice would be
to…“avoid paperwork.”</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Eliminate them, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Well, no one’s out there, but officially
these are “hostile zones.” Therefore you’d be within your rights to
classify anyone as “hostile,” I think. But I repeat, you should be
worried about boredom, not action. Any other questions before I go?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Down there…is it snowing?</p>
<p><strong>mekum</strong>: Not in the Caribbean. Have a good Christmas,
guys. See you when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Merry Christmas, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Hi, fellas. At ease!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Merry Christmas, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: We brought you a little Christmas tree.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: And some good cheer.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: How about some Christmas pussy, guys? Anybody
for a quick piece?</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: That’s “conduct unbecoming,” Sloan.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: It’s Christmas! Haven’t you heard of piece on
earth? “Piece on earth,” get it?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Christ, I wish we were on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Eat, drink, and be merry, men. For tomorrow
you go on patrol in the “hostile zone.”</p>
<p><strong>a montage of faces: jimmy “santa” pig, mace, sandra,
red,</strong>: CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: We’ll eat these.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It seemed like he was never going to walk.
Then all of a sudden…he’s an expert.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Well, not quite an expert.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant Todd…what’s it like…what’s it like
being a soldier?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: What do you think about?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Do you think about food? Or women? You must
think about something.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: What about feelings then? You must have
feelings. You must feel something.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Fear.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Fear! You mean…you feel afraid? That’s when
you’re in battle… What about other times? Now, for example?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Fear.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You don’t…look afraid. You look
fearless.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Fear and…discipline.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Oh, my God. But there’s nothing to be afraid
of here. I can’t hurt you. I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Always. It makes us…alert.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re not supposed to do that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So what? I’m a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They’re gonna kick him out.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: They can’t kick him out…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They’re gonna. My father –</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My mother says when someone’s sick or hurt,
you have to help them. You don’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, but what if the hurt person
is…evil?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You still have to help them… because if you
don’t, you’re evil!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My father says…uh…he says, “Soldiers deserve
soldiers.”</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah. That’s what my father said too.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My father’s making Sergeant Todd a scarf
because he saved his life one time. He’s knitting it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s dumb. Your father’s dumb.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig’s wife</strong>: Jimmy knitted it himself. He
worked on it for two months.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It’s beautiful, Jimmy. He’ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: He saved my life out there. I guess Mace
told you.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You should give it to him yourself. I think
he’s in the meeting room… doing…exercises.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Scarf! Scarf!</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: What….? What… are…those? Chester! CHESTER!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Those are my war marks. From the battles I
fought.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: There’s going to be a meeting. People are
upset about him.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He’s not fully recovered.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: That’s what scares people. He gets stronger
every day.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I’ve caught him..sneaking looks at you. At
your body.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Are you afraid of him, Mace?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yes. God knows where he’s been…or what he’s
done.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I’ve never been afraid of anyone before…not
this way. I feel he could break me in half…with no real effort and no
real…feeling.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He told me he’s afraid.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Maybe he is. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: No one here has any animosity toward you,
Sergeant. None of us here is your enemy.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Moreover, we respect your qualities. We
have no doubt that you are a very, very good soldier.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: But, because of your training, I don’t
think you’ll ever be able to function in a group like this, a community
of vulnerable people, of families, of children, where the ability to
fight is not the sole purpose of existence.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: You’re different from us, Sergeant. We
don’t hate you for that, but we have agreed that to try to include you
would pose an intolerable risk to the community itself.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: We’ll give you any tools you need, warm
clothing, a good knife, boots.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: And if you’re ever sick…or you get hurt…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You’re a friend, Sergeant. It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: If you need us…you can ask us for help.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: It’s not true. I’m not a good soldier.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Crawler, Crawler to Daddy. No
hostiles!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: All right, Crawler, Crawler, we got you.
This is Daddy. Continue per, over.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: We’re clear. We can send a crew out.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Sloan’s already on it.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Suit up, fellas. Time to go build another
play house.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Yes, Riley, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: We haven’t been issued weapons, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You won’t need weapons, Riley. You’re not
soldiers anymore.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You don’t even have to salute anymore. A
simple “Yes, sir” will do.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Y-yes…sir.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Every time it’s time to send them out, Riley
asks about weapons. And every time I tell him they don’t need weapons
anymore, they’re not soldiers anymore.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Jesus! It says here Macy’s is going out of
business. Can you imagine that? New York without Macy’s?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Next one’s going to be a real pain in the
ass.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Yeah? What flavor pain in the ass? Gravity
pain in the ass? Atmosphere pain in the ass?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: How about a “gaseous currents” and “urgent
convections” pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I think you’re trying to say a “wind pain in
the ass.”</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Wind!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Mace! What about the vote? Everybody
voted.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: We voted wrong!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: It’s a dump. Literally.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: No shit! We’re gonna set up a monitor on a
garbage dump! So we can monitor garbage rusting?</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Will the wind affect the patrol?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: The Crawlers are low enough and heavy
enough, they won’t blow. The men should wear armored vests and carry
double weapons and ammo for the weight. They may have to use lines too,
like mountain climbers.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Damn! Thank you, Todd. God damn! I almost took
a… a…swim there!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: My…God! Someone’s landing.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Someone’s landing! Jimmy Pig spotted a
ship!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Look at that. It’s some kind of vehicle. A
landing party. HEY!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: …maybe…they’re… …friendly…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Oh, shit, Todd…I’m…dead… aren’t I? I’m not
going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I’m not..a soldier. A…mistake? Was it…a
mistake?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Oh, my God. They won’t…they won’t…? Not
Sandra! Not… not…Nathan!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Soldiers! Soldiers… …deserve…soldiers!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: People. They’ve spotted people!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: “People”! “People”? What do you mean
“people”?</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Two civilians. Unarmed. They’ve killed both
of them. They’ve spotted smoke from some kind of camp and they’re going
to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: A camp! Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Damn! Did they ask for assistance?</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Like my daddy used to say, “Nothing’s ever
as simple as it’s supposed to be…except shit.”</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Thank you, “Daddy.”</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Who do you think they are?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The civilians? Squatters…refugees. I don’t
think we want to know, do we?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: I’m going to go out and talk to them. More
than likely they’re friendly. If not… …those of you with weapons will be
ready to defend us. The rest of you go back.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Report from Crawler One. Everything under
control. No need for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: There’s resistance?</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Ineffectual. About fifty disorganized
people with almost no fire power. Three men are going in to clean them
out; one man’s staying with the Crawler.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Humph. Sounds reckless, three against fifty.
The old ones, the veterans, they would have called for support…just in
case.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Speaking of Riley and his old soldiers…why
don’t we let them start putting up the unit? It’s gonna take forever in
this wind.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Will we be issued weapons, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: No, Riley…no weapons. You’re not a soldier,
Riley.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Keep going, children, don’t panic, don’t
panic.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: They got armored vests. You got to aim for
exposed parts like the face…</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: Here goes.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You want help, partner?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Into the bedroom, all of you.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant Todd!</p>
<p><strong>walkie-talkie</strong>: Crawler One calling Double Mike. Give
me an “okay,” Double Mike.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Crawler to Daddy, Crawler to Daddy. Come
in, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: A “growl”! He heard a growl?</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Well, he didn’t say the word “growl.” He
said a “throat-noise,” but I asked him to imitate it and it sounded like
a growl to me.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: My God! Who are we fighting here!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: I think…I think we have to assume the
missing men are…down.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: I knew Mekum’s hotshots were green. No
reinforcements, then they walk right into an enemy stronghold.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: We could send reinforcements now…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Absolutely not. Those bastards are just
waiting in there for us. No more of this fancy super-soldier shit. We do
it with the hammer…</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Uh, what does that mean, “the hammer”?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: My daddy always said, “When you want to
insert a nail in a piece of wood, you don’t do nothing fancy or
glamorous, you don’t finesse or play the hero, you just pick up your
damn hammer and hit that sumbitch till it’s in.”</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Christ! Now Daddy’s a carpenter!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: I…don’t…quite…follow…sir.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Take the whole unit, both Crawlers, and tell
’em to pound that place with rockets, cannons, mortars, everything we
got…from a safe distance.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Raw firepower!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: It may not be heroic, and we may waste some
ammo, but by God we’ll get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Nathan, thank God, there you…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Did he find you?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: My husband…Mace…he went out to look for you.
He…found you, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: They…killed him…didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Your wound…it’s still bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I like to bleed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It doesn’t…hurt?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Not enough, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: How do you know they’ll come back?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: They’re soldiers, sir. Like me.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: What…what do they want?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: They are obeying orders, sir. It’s their
duty.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You know who they are, don’t you? Do you
know how many there’ll be?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Seventeen more, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Seventeen! My God! You can’t fight seventeen
yourself! You have to organize the rest of us, show us what to do. We
don’t have your…your skills…but we’re not cowards. We’ll do what you
tell us, we’ll –</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: But…one soldier against seventeen!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I am going to kill them all, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Double belts, double ammo, double everything!
You’ve got to be heavy there or you’ll blow away, fellas…and we wouldn’t
want that, would we?</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: It’s dark now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You’re afraid of the dark, Sergeant
Caine?</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: No, sir. But the manual says –</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’s what nightscopes are for, soldier. For
the dark.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Yes, sir. But the sixth rule is “never
give the enemy an advantage unnecessarily.” If they’re expecting us
–</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Listen, Sergeant, this may come as news to
you, but you’re not a real hot thinker! Your pitiful efforts at tactics
have cost us three men already. So turn it off, that little pea brain of
yours! That goes for all the rest of you mental giants too. All you have
to do is go boom-boom. Understand? Boom-boom! Kill kill! Say it…
Kill…kill…kill…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant! Sergeant Todd!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant…these soldiers…the ones you’re
going to fight… Are these the “better ones”…the ones who replaced
you?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant Todd…I think they…I think…someone
made a serious… mistake.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the junk and the skeleton ship</strong>: a ghostly
graveyard. No wind. Nothing moves. No sign of TODD.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Crawler Two to Crawler One. Do you have a
sitrep?</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Crawler Two, we are one down, responding to
sniper activity.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Crawler One, do you require
assistance?</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: That is negative. We will eliminate the
sniper and rendezvous at target.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Roger, One. We are proceeding to
target.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Tentative at One.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: That’s negative, no target.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Where’s my father? Where’s my father?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Johnny, get over under that table with
Miss Sandra and Ellen and the others. Miss Judith, you better go on down
the root cellar with Emma and help with the ones down there.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Where’s my mother?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Come on, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Crawler Two to Crawler One. Come in,
One.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Two to one, take your port to our nine
o’clock and commence firing.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Copy, Two. Port to your nine and commence
firing.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Crawler Two to Crawler One. Again;
proceed to port nine…</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Affirmative, Two.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Two to One. You are still on twelve
o’clock. Correct to nine.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: Gunner, hard to port, target hard to
port!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Roger, Two. Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Whaaaaat?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: They stopped shooting!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Give us a hand, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: You think that’s good they stopped? It means
they’re comin’ for us! To kill us! That’s good news, you think?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant Todd said…</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: That he’s gonna stomp a whole army? Couldn’t
if he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He knew them! He said –</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: He’s dead! If he isn’t dead, he joined ’em.
He don’t care about us, he’s a soldier. Besides, we threw him out,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He’s not dead!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: This is Daddy, come in, Number Two. Daddy
calling Number Two…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: What about Number One? Try Number…</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: I tried One. I can’t get either one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: There was…some kind of… guerilla action…</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Then we lost them…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: You should have waked me sooner! This is
bad, very bad. I never should have let that clown Mekum test his wonder
boy army on me. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Shit! We don’t even
know what we’re up against. How many…?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We couldn’t get any figures on enemy troop
strength.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Not even estimates…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: We’re sitting ducks here! There could be a
couple of divisions! More! We don’t even have the weapons to arm the old
soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Hello… Hello, One. This is Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: This is Daddy! Come in, Crawler Two, come
in…</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Get them kids hid somewhere! There’s soldiers
coming.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Don’t worry. Couple more inches and
they’re out.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: You know where Thomas keeps those two axes?
Go get the axes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: We can’t chop ’em out. We don’t have
time.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Just as good to die chopping as fighting.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: This ain’t gonna work. Where’s them axes? He
musta run into soldiers and got killed.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: How do you know there’s soldiers
coming?</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: ’Cause soldiers finish what they start –
unless you stop ’em. And we’re what they started, and we didn’t stop
’em!</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Only one axe?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: They took the other one!</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Toldja.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I… I couldn’t… I couldn’t… count ’em. Four, I
think. Maybe five.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: More! Trust me!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Turns.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Do what you can.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: They’re gonna kill us anyhow. No point in
surrendering. Turn!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: “– sailed an a river of crystal light into a
sea of dew. Where are you going and what do you wish the old moon asked
the three. ‘We’ve come to fish for herring fish…’”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s a “moon?”</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I know what a moon is! It’s…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Oh, my God! It’s… it’s you!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Are you…all right?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: We should go, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Go?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sarah, you hang on to Sergeant Todd. No
matter what happens!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Ellen, go to the Commons. Tell Jimmy Pig and
Mr. Slade that Sergeant Todd says we have to leave as soon as they get
everybody out of the root-cellar. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Uh, yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It’s all right. The soldiers are gone for
now. But be careful where you walk. And if it’s too smoky, just come
back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Tell them to bring all the food and clothing
they can carry. Do you all understand that Sergeant Todd here is going
to help us, and whatever he says to do you must do immediately, as if he
was your father or your mother.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s not my father!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: No… but he’s our friend. Our good friend. Do
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I want my father and my mother! Can he find
where my father is? I want him to find my father!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: No. No, he can’t do that, but –</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant Todd!</p>
<p><strong>mekum/video screen</strong>: You can’t be serious! This is
some kind of a joke…in poor taste.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Not only are we apparently out twenty of
your fancy new soldiers, your supermen, we’re out both crawlers and all
the weapons…so we can’t arm the old soldiers, the ones you “improved”
on, to defend ourselves…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We’ve got to get out of here, Colonel
Mekum!</p>
<p><strong>mekum/video image</strong>: Abort? You want to lose twenty
top soldiers to a phantom army and then abort the mission? Do you know
what that would look like on my record? Or yours? We’d be explaining it
for the next fifty years from some goddam assignment in God knows where,
we’d –</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Well, how’s it gonna look when we lose the
ship too? How’s that gonna look on the old record? ’Cause that’s what’s
gonna happen if we don’t get our ass outta here. We can’t defend
ourselves with no weapons and –</p>
<p><strong>mekum/video image</strong>: Hold on, hold on there, Captain!
At ease! Let’s calm down and remember…remember we’re soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Good plan, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>mekum/video image</strong>: Now we can’t just get the shit
kicked out of us by an unknown guerilla army… But maybe we
could…alter…our objective…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>mekum/video image</strong>: Nuke the joint…and get out!</p>
<p><strong>caine 607</strong>: It hurts!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sergeant…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Nathan!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: S-sir…sir, are you our friend? Sh-she said
you were our friend.</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy pig</strong>: Thank God!</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Well, Riley, you wanted a weapon, right? Now
you got one! A real biggee!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: What good’ll it do just setting it outside?
We don’t know where the enemy is.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Doesn’t matter. For once Mekum’s on the
ball. This is a very dirty bomb! That wind will churn the radioactivity
around like soap in a washing machine. This is gonna be one clean place
in a very short time…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Okay, fellas, take it about a hundred yards,
then get back on the double…unless you wanna fry.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Right horizontal?</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Roger. Right horizontal checks green.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: All right we’re “go.” I’m allowing us three
minutes to clear the atmosphere and get out of range. That means we can
wait seven more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Fuck ’em! Let’s just go!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: She’s right! Four more casualties aren’t
gonna mean anything to anybody, especially when they’re already
obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: I guess they wouldn’t want to get old
anyway. Go ahead, lock the hatch. Rube, punch up the port power cluster
and –</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Huh? What was what?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Sssshhhh! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: It sounds…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Like a kid!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Are you crazy? You can’t do this, soldier!
You’re going to be in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: I’m your superior officer, don’t you
understand that?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Don’t you realize you’re violating the chain
of command? I’m giving you a direct order to…to…to…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: S-sergeant? S-sergeant T-todd? It… You…!
How…? How…?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Sergeant Todd!</p>
<p><strong>rubrick</strong>: Listen, you don’t understand! That bomb is
triggered! It’s on a timer!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: We have to get out of here! All of us! You
need us! You need us to operate the ship…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Twenty seconds. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Oh, my God, I can’t remember if it’s
six-seven or seven-six…</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Try one! Try it!</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: There! I did it! Did it stop? Did it – ?</p>
<p><strong>mekum/video image</strong>: …I need a report, Captain. It’s
not just my ass, it’s yours too! You’ve got to stand by me on this. I
want you to come in right now… right now! Do you understand me? Right
now!</p>
<p><strong>mekum/video image</strong>: This is important for all of us,
for our careers. There’s going to be a Board of Inquiry and –</p>
<p><strong>slade’s voice</strong>: That was the boss, huh?</p>
<p><strong>slade</strong>: Well then, I guess you fellas are all right.
I guess I misjudged you some. Where I said you were “a buncha no good
killer robots,” I mighta just overspoke myself. As of now, till it goes
otherwise, you got my sincere approval and support.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Cold.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Air?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Safe?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: But very cold.</p>
