<h1 id="rko-281">rko-281</h1>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Come into the light.. Come into the light</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Mother…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You are made for the light, Orson Now you
must blow out your candles. But you must always remember, the cake
itself is nothing. The flame, the lights, that is where your future
lies. You must have a dream. A great dream worthy of you.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: He came to the town of magic and
dreams a flashing star blazing through the firmament of illusion. And he
promised to devour the world in a single gulp. He was 24 years old and
his name was George Orson Welles. Sound the trumpets! Unfurl the
banners, Hollywood! The Boy Wonder has arrived!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: He made his debut on the world stage
in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on the 6th of May, 1915. And on the 7th of May he
spoke his first words, and unlike other children who say commonplace
things like “momma” and “poppa”, he proclaimed “I am a genius!”</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: So how could the magic of the stage
not call to this adventurous lad? Unstoppable and resolute, the Boy
Wonder journeyed into the world of the legit theater. After a
peripatetic beginning he found himself at last in New York where he
joined forces with theatrical producer John Houseman under the august
auspices of the WPA Federal Theater.</p>
<p><strong>houseman</strong>: Orson barreled in and took over. Orson’s a
real barreler.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: Like Hannibal over the Alps, the Boy
Genius invaded the Great White Way. He stunned the sedate elite of New
York theatre with production after production. From MACBETH with an
entirely colored cast to a Mussolini-inspired JULIUS CAESAR!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: Though he wowed the critics with his
spectaculars the ticket sales left something to be desired. So, after
founding the Mercury Players with Houseman, young Mr. Welles quickly set
his sights on the airwaves. He quickly became the sonorous -’ voice of
“The Shadow.” ’’</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of
men? The Shadow knows. . .</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: With Lament Cranston in one pocket
and his own radio show. The Mercury Theater of the Air, our Boy Wonder
filled the night with his resounding tones. And on October 30th of 1938,
he became what he felt destined to be: a household name.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: THE WAR OF THE WORLDS sent this
nation spinning into a frenzy. Nine million listeners clasped their
loved ones close and looked to the skies with horror. Unlucky listeners
near the epicenter of the “invasion” – rural New Jersey – ran screaming
into the night, sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death awaited them
around every corner! The mischievous Boy Wonder had fooled us all!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Of course … of course … if I had known the
panic the broadcast was causing – well I would have stopped! I never
meant for any of this to happen and I feel just horrible!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: How long, oh how long could it
possibly be before the sunny land of dreams tried to harness the
combustible power of this showman, this impresario, this best of all
possible Boy Wonders?!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: The winner in the Welles derby was
George Schaefer, the head of RKO Pictures. With a contract unimaginable
before The Days Of Orson, Mr. Schaefer captured the whirlwind snared the
beast, roped the tyrant!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: Eyebrows raised and jaws dropped all
over Hollywoodland when the terms of the deal that lured The Great Orson
came forth: the Boy Wonder could produce, write, direct and star in his
own projects with budgets up to $500,000 a picture! He would have total
control over the shooting of the picture and the finished product. The
studio, well, they just paid the bills. Meanwhile, the insiders of
filmland were skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood insider</strong>: John Ford doesn’t have a deal
like that. Cecil B. DeMille doesn’t have a deal like that. No one has a
deal like that! If ya ask me, George Schaefer is just plain nuts</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: So Cometh Orson! He toured the RKO
studio and met with the biggest of the big! He charmed his way through
the town from the Brown Derby to the Copacabana, from the Pacific
Palisades to the Hollywood Hills!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: Yes, the Boy Wonder had arrived! He
even charmed those rival maidens of Hollywood gossip, those well-
coiffured chroniclers of the dream factory: Hedda Hopper and Louella
Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Orson is the sweetest boy. We’re both from
the midwest, you know. He’s just a local fella making good, ya
follow?</p>
<p><strong>newsreel voice</strong>: So today, almost a year after his
arrival in Hollywood, we leave the Boy Wonder still hard at work
developing his much-anticipated first feature, preparing to dazzle us
all again. We’re waiting, Orson!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll tell you what, this is the best
electric train set a boy ever had!</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Who does that cocksucker think he is?</p>
<p><strong>flunkie</strong>: They’re laying bets over on the RKO lot
that this great deal will end up with him never doing a picture. Back to
New York he goes.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Serves him right. I mean can you stomach the
arrogance?</p>
<p><strong>flunkie</strong>: Inside skinny says the glory boy’s
finished, can’t come up with a movie. Wants to do a biography now.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: After RKO boots him maybe we’ll pick him up
cheap. Have him do that WAR OF THE WORLDS crap as a feature.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I don’t know what you expected with Joseph-
fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: All right! Enough! I’ve heard this from
Schaefer and RKO. I’ve heard it from everyone–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: But you keep coming up with the same elitist
crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one
wants to see that.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Nonsense</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: What are movies about, Orson?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Forget it-</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: What are movies about?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Telling stories.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Showing life</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Who the hell wants to see life?! People are
sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want
Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Magic</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Butts on seats. That’s what movies are about.
You got one job in Hollywood – everyone has the same job, in fact –
putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell ’em popcorn and Pepsi-
cola. It’s all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Then you better get ready to be the youngest
never- was in Hollywood history.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s better than being the oldest has-been
in Hollywood history.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: You’re a laugh-riot, kid.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Here, turn around.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So, we’ve got to come up with our movie. Our
biography.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Right-</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We find the man and then we dissect him-</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Like a bug.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: But with compassion and insight–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn’t
cotton to lateness.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Hearst? My name is Orson
Welles.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How about Howard Hughes? We could do
Hughes</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I’m not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker
would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over
Utah</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And we would hear them scuttling around at
night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I’m
just imagining plague lice jumpin’ all over the damn place So we set
t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps
sprung but no mice!</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Houdini mice.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Just wait. So one night I notice Pops
getting outta bed and sneaking away. And he’s got this little p-p- paper
bag with him, right? Middle of the night. So I figure the old man’s
really up to no good this time and I follow him. Well I’ll be
g-g-goddamned if he’s not springing all the traps and leaving cheese for
the rats!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You and that freak Disney, in love with the
damn rats!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: They really are sweet little things</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Sigmund Freud?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph
Conrad and now you’re gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the
id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Manolete?!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Who the hell’s Manolete?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: The great Spanish bullfighter</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I don’t wanna write about no spic.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, it’s perfect! When in doubt, put on a
cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the
life-blood of the actor’s craft since the days of lrving and Booth.
Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian
plains–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Why Mr. Welles is attempting semaphore</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Bullfighting, Miss Davies!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And is dear Mank your b-b-bull?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: My factotum, ally and comrade-in-arms</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Writer, flunkie, pimp–</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: You fight many bulls there in New
York, Orson?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Ever met Walter Winchell?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, when I was but a tender lad–</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Last week would this be?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: My father and I made a tour of the grand
boulevards of antique Europe. And when we were in Iberia I had the
chance to face the bulls. At the knee of the great Manolete I took up
the cape and sword - – across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to
have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! So - - with Manolete
shouting encouragement I flourished . . . I flourished again . . . and
the bull charged! Across the golden dust it came, thundering like the
great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its calamitous hooves
pounding into the dirt, shaking the earth as I held the crimson eye of
the bull with my own, defying it – it was almost upon me and I
flourished one last time! – the monster swept past! - – and my sword was
gone – buried in the bloody eye of the beast!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: You are evidently a man who knows a great
deal about bull.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Of all man’s malignity – of all his sadism –
none is more depraved than cruelty to animals.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: In Spain the cruelty would be in denying the
beast a fighting end.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Who are you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: My name is Orson Welles</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: The actor</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: And director.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I see. And you are in California for what
reason?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: To make pictures.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: And what pictures have you made?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous
business.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So I’ve been told.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most
brutally killed.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll remember that.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Enough Hollywood talk! Can’t anyone talk
about anything else?</p>
<p><strong>manx</strong>: Heard some juicy gossip from Metro.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Ooh, dish.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: The man doesn’t allow drinking or cigars?
This is monstrous.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: The old man has his own way of doing
things</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He’s nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches
morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the
world but he lives openly with his mistress.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Buddy, when you own the largest publishing
empire in the universe you can do whatever the hell you want. Think
about it, pal. Every day one out of five Americans picks up a Hearst
publication. 30 newspapers, a dozen magazines, a bunch of radio stations
and the grand dragon of them all. Little Miss Louella Parsons. Tends to
give you some of that ol’ noblesse oblige.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Look at those hands. Those are the hands of
an artist. A modern Caravaggio.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: No, baby, those are the hands of a killer</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: There you are, honey. Aren’t you a wonderful
girl?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: God, these parties are the worst</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: You need to get outta here,
Rapunzel</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’s why he has the parties, he says it’s
like bringing the world to me.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Why don’t you come down to LA? Stay
with us for a while.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: With about twenty of his spies on my tail.
No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s not so bad here. After all, what girl
doesn’t want to live in a castle?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Mr. Welles certainly is a caution</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Yeah, Orson’s a real piece of work.
But deep down, he’s a good kid. Real deep down.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And attractive in a hammy sort of way.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Listen, you come down and stay with
us for a few days. Just tell the old man that–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I can’t</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Sure you can, just–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: He needs me here.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: “In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure
dome decree. . .”How big is it, all told? The estate?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: The whole joint is half the size of Rhode
Island.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Jesus</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Yeah, it’s the place God would have built, if
he’d had the money.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Mankie, Mankie d-d-dance with me</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: You’ve been naughty, haven’t you, honey?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Shit, can you smell it? You got any
sen-sen?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Mr. Welles, you got any–? Oh fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Meanwhile, Orson, I thought your
bullfighting story was nifty. Let’s cut a rug.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: So you ever gonna do a picture?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Not you too</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: It’s gonna be fine, Orson. You’re
gonna do great.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I wonder sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: You’re just scared.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>carols lombard</strong>: Sure</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: And what am I scared of?</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Of being found out. Of not being a
genius</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Oh, but haven’t you heard? I’m the Boy
Wonder. I’ve been a genius since the moment I was born.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: We’ve known each other too long,
Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to
pacify you with evasions of–</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Don’t insult me with your cute press
quotes Save it for Louella.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: You make your mark, Orson.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda
life!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: There’s no call for that language-</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw,
to hell with you!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That poor woman.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: She knew what she was signing on for
After all, she took the money.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so
long?!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Orson, please … it’s too bright</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Here you are, up with the birds for once,
you vampire!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Okay, boy wonder, what?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Listen … I’ve got it! It came to me like a
thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Oh for Christ’s sake-</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I know who we’re going to get I The great
American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: This better be good</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Image a man that has shaped his time. A
titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an
empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious
palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath
him. Feudal.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Oh Christ…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Image the possibilities as this man controls
the public perception of the nation through his–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Oh Christ</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Please don’t say this.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mank-</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Don’t whisper it. Don’t even think it</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How long have we spent casting our minds
about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our
noses – every single day in the newspapers and on the radio – waiting
for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for–!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Orson. Stop. Just stop</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Now remember he’s a public figure who sought
out that publicity so legally he can’t stop us from–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Listen to you. You child! Men like him don’t
bother with things like legality. They don’t have to. You know why,
boy-o? Power. Power like you couldn’t even begin to imagine.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst
he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We’re doing Hearst.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: You may think you know what you’re talking
about, kid, but believe me, you don’t. You’re talking about going into a
battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like
movies and Hollywood that Hearst won’t even have to glance down when he
crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I’m talking about
money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So speaks the court jester.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Fuck you</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I expected more from you.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Sorry to disappoint.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the
palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little
stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly
little monkey they keep to amuse themselves–?!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: It feels just fine, you pompous fuck-</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I remember a man who wrote I He was a
brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and
insight–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Don’t do this</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Where did he go? He hasn’t had a screen
credit in four years–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Don’t do this</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: –Because he has been so furiously busy
wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because
he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire
him because he’s a drunk- -!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: AND YOU’RE NOTHING BUT A GODDAMN PHONY! What
is all this “Orson Welles” bullshit?! This boy genius crap?! What the
fuck did you ever CREATE? You’re just another goddamn ACTOR!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Let me out.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Listen to me-</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Fuck you–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I am giving you the last chance you will
ever have to be yourself again!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I don’t have it anymore?!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world
too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling
great stories. But all that’s finished for me–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It doesn’t have to be</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: And yeah, sure, Hearst’s a great subject. Been
keeping notes on him for years for my … great American novel. But I
can’t do it anymore. No studio’s gonna hire me and I - -</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll hire you – right now-</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I can’t do it. okay?! I drink too much – I
drink all the fucking time and I don’t have it anymore. All that is over
for me–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Look, Mank, this is our only chance</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: He’ll destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Then let him. What have we got to lose, you
and I?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Take my hand, Mank. And we’ll dance one last
time. We’ll dance to the music of the angels. We’ll make history. We’ll
scorch the earth. We will … astonish them all.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Thank God you don’t write dialogue</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So, who is he? We have to know him.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Everyone sees someone different. That’s what
we show.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a
different facet is illuminated.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Go</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: The key – the key – the clue – what does
this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you’re dying. What’s the
last image that comes to you? Right now.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a
word to her.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Why her?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: She was . . . innocent</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: So when was our man innocent? Was there a
moment early on – of innocence and bliss? There must have been. Okay,
you’re dying - what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Something you lost maybe?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Something you can never get back?</p>
<p><strong>mank’s voice</strong>: Men like Hearst don’t love..</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: All men love. But men like Hearst – they
don’t bother with convention because–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: They don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He loves in his own way. On his conditions.
Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hearst looks down at the world at his feet
Everything has always been beneath him.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: And what does he see?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: The people. When they pay him homage, he
adores them. But when they have the … audacity to question him. To doubt
him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: And when he looks up? What does he dream
about?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I’m ready to write it, Orson</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Leiand: “You talk about the people as if you
owned them. As though they belonged to you. But you don’t really care
about anything except you.” Craig: “A toast then, Jedediah, to all those
people who didn’t vote for me today and to love on my own terms. Those
are the only terms anybody ever knows. . .”</p>
<p><strong>mank’s voice</strong>: “…because in the end a man looks into
the mirror and sees one face looking back not humanity – not”the people”
– one face. And he’s got to be able to look at that one face and know he
was true. ”</p>
<p><strong>john houseman</strong>: That’s too long. Tighten it up</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: You’re killin’ me here, Housey. Okay, make
that, Craig: “A toast, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the
only terms anybody ever knows, his own.”</p>
<p><strong>john houseman</strong>: Telegram from The Christ Child</p>
<p><strong>john houseman</strong>: “Schaefer loves the idea. Stop. Start
writing. Stop. Stop drinking. Stop. Did you work in the jigsaw puzzles.
Question mark. Don’t stop. Stop. Love you madly, Orson.”</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: That man makes my brain hurt</p>
<p><strong>welles’ voice</strong>: And Gregg Toland plunks down his
Oscar for WUTHERING HEIGHTS and says, “Mr. Welles, I want to shoot your
picture. . .”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: … And I said, “Mr. Toland, you are the
finest cinematographer in Hollywood, why would you desire to work with a
stumbling neophyte?”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: And he replied, “Mr. Welles, the only way to
learn anything new is to work with someone who doesn’t know a damn
thing.”</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Priceless!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hedda, this movie is going to look like no
other picture ever made.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Tome it’s a question of truth and illusion.
Don’t you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What we are going to do is shoot life – in
all it’s joyous complexity.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Consider this quarter, my dear. You can
touch it and feel it and were you to lean forward you could even smell
it. Why is it that in the movies a simple bit of reality – a quarter, a
room, a man–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Becomes nothing but a lie? A trick. An
illusion.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I will show the reality behind the
trick.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I will use the illusions of Hollywood to
show . . . the truth.</p>
<p><strong>hedda</strong>: What does truth have to do with movies?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: So, what, it went into your other hand?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: And so the dreamer awakens into the realms
of reality. He has been given a rendition of the truth. He has been
treated with respect.</p>
<p><strong>hedda</strong>: Orson, that’s all terribly interesting but
what’s all this about you and Dolores Del Rio? Do I hear love birds
a’singin’?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Now, Orson, you know I’m just dyin’ to see
your picture and I know it’s gonna be boffo, but you’re writing about a
publisher, right?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We’re using-</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: You’re not doin’ Hearst, are you?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Good God no! The character is a delicious
amalgamation of various press barons–</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: A delicious amalgamation, is it?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s right. A symphony of those: vaunted
and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on
our liberties–</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me
you are not doing Hearst.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I am not doing Hearst.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s 350 pages long.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Yeah, but the margins are real wide.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It is 350 pages of … ABSOLUTE
INSPIRATION!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Housey, get us a drink.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I told you you could do this! How could you
have ever doubted me!? You must never doubt me again!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: It’s good, huh?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It’s
terrific! Now I’ll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the
scenes aren’t exactly . . . exactly . . .</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Short enough. But this is a grand start And
I think we need to change the name.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: The title?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly
sent from God’s soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean
the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn’t have the
knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about “Kane” – you like
that?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Cain – like the Bible guy?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Craig is one syllable</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: But it’s not a great syllable</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I –um– I don’t know if I should. I ain’t been
drinking since I started on this–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: To my invaluable comrade Drink up!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I’m out, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>houseman</strong>: Welcome to the world of Orson Welles.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Jesus Christ –</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Pal from the studio sent this – you see that?!
What does it say?! WHAT DOES IT SAY ORSON?!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Get away from me–</p>
<p><strong>manx</strong>: It says AMERICAN by Orson Welles. YOU TOOK MY
NAME</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s obviously a mistake, Manki Some steno
girl made a mistake, alright?!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: You can’t do this to me–!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I fucking well can! I own your script and I
can do anything I goddamn want. And don’t forget for one minute that I
took your 350 pages of drunken rambling and I made a movie out of them –
and now I’ve got to shoot the bastard. So thank you very much, I have
all I need. And you can stop calling me.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I hope you choke on it. I hope it kills
you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: This is supposed ta be Siam or some such.
Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I
can’t see it myself–</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Darling, I talked to Millicent.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: She said no</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: She’s a Catholic. She says it would put her
soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Nuts. She only cares about the money. She
thinks I’ll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w… will.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s an awful title, of course, but I can’t
think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES –
which has a nice, grand ring to it – and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA
but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid,
Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: CITIZEN KANE There’s your title.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: A “Z” and a “K” in the title. That would
draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a
“Z” and a “P” and that worked–</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Now look, Orson, let’s not get ahead of
ourselves. The budget projections on this–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I know, I know! But what more can you expect
of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to
cut more would be to–!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Listen, get off your horse with me. You
know I’ve stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while
the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else
in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract
stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one’s gonna come in at 750
thousand. What do we do about that?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Now don’t have a fit – but I want you to
think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Jesus</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and
everyone’s happy. You make some money and New York’s happy and you have
a track record and then we’ll move on to</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Please don’t ask me to do this.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It’s the safe bet, Orson. There’s nothing
wrong with that.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: George, I want you to let me make this movie
because I need to make it. And I don’t really know</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s your decision, George. If you look into
my eyes right now and say, go make WAR OF THE WORLDS, I will. I’ll make
it. And, yes, it’ll make you money.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: If it’ll get you the hell out of my
office, go ahead and make the picture.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Say thank you, Orson.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: For the title</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Ah, it’s a grand title.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Like it would kill him to say thank
you</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Today we - -</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Today we are going to break every rule in
motion picture history…</p>
<p><strong>welles’ voice</strong>: Together we will throw away all the
maps and we will become -joyously lost in the wilderness. And the future
cartographers of Hollywood will forever chart our course. Following our
lead…</p>
<p><strong>welles’ voice</strong>: And do you know why we’re going to do
this?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We’re going to do this because it’s going to
be fun.</p>
<p><strong>paul stewart</strong>: “Rosebud? I’ll tell you about
Rosebud.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>paul stewart</strong>: “Rosebud? I’ll tell you about
Rosebud.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>paul stewart</strong>: “Rosebud? I’ll tell you about
Rosebud.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Again</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It needs a ceiling, Gregg. Real rooms have
real ceilings.</p>
<p><strong>gregg toland</strong>: You want a ceiling on this one
too?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>gregg toland</strong>: Gonna be tough</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, it’s gonna be impossible. That’s why
we’re doing it.</p>
<p><strong>paul stewart</strong>: “Rosebud? I’ll tell you about
Rosebud.”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Again</p>
<p><strong>paul stewart</strong>: “Rosebud? I’ll tell you about
Rosebud</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Again</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, that didn’t really work</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It is the most important line of the
picture. You will weave the magic of “Rosebud” in a single word - - you
will say the word in such a way as to impart to us the mystery of it. It
is a divine and sinister mystery worthy only of your talent. In this one
word the movie soars or falls. Once more, I beg you.</p>
<p><strong>paul stewart</strong>: “Rosebud? I’ll tell you about
Rosebud.”</p>
<p><strong>welles’ voice</strong>: Print. ;’</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Actors.</p>
<p><strong>electrician</strong>: Mr. Welles…?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy commingore</strong>: “Charlie, you sure got the
funniest ways of looking at things .”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No – no – I’ll pour the tea. Sorry. I should
pour the tea. Let’s try that again.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay, here we go… Set. Action</p>
<p><strong>dorothy commingore</strong>: “Charlie, you sure got the
funniest ways of looking at things .”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No – that’s not right</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Urn. . . ah . . . yes – you should
definitely pour the tea. Okay, again. Sorry…. Set. Action.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy commingore</strong>: “Charlie, you sure got the
funniest ways of looking at things .”</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: Orson, you wanna take five?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Five…? Yes. No. We’re done today</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: I don’t know if this means anything but
I just talked to a guy in the RKO art department They’ve got all these
books and crap all over the place. Pictures of San Simeon.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: For the Welles picture.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Pictures of the castle?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Thanks, doll. Get me more.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: And I’m looking at them – and they’re all
looking at me and I don’t know who should pour the tea. ’</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I just can’t . . see it anymore</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I want you back</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Fuck you. You wanted me out. I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: This is the shooting script we’ve been using
every day.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s just like we always said it would
be</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Too late, kid.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Did I ever tell you about my father?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I don’t give a shit about-</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He was a drunk. And he was my father and I
was ashamed of him.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He showed me the world, he took me with him
everywhere – Europe, China – and he was so proud of me. But he would
drink and he would get …embarrassing. And I began to resent him Because
I was so … sparkling, you see.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: When I finally saw him again, he was in a
coffin. I was fifteen. And all of a sudden he wasn’t that embarrassing
drunk anymore … he was the man who showed me the world.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Just like you, Mank.</p>
<p><strong>mank’s voice</strong>: So you’ve lost it? Don’t know who
should pour the tea.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p><strong>mank’s voice</strong>: Orson … just cut the goddamn tea</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay</p>
<p><strong>mank’s voice</strong>: I been thinking about the beach scene.
You done that yet?</p>
<p><strong>mank’s voice</strong>: Good – cause I was thinking that we’re
starting the scene too late…</p>
<p><strong>mank’s voice</strong>: Cause if we don’t show Susan watching
Kane more then we’re not building the right tension into the scene. See,
she’s gotta know that…</p>
<p><strong>toland’s voice</strong>: Closer … closer … closer – stop. We
just lost your head.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Can you see my shoes?</p>
<p><strong>toland’s voice</strong>: Yeah, but we lose your head.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Goddamn it Joe – stand here</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s just not low enough. This is the scene.
We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As
towering virtues in combat–</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: Spare me the aria, I know what you want–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I need my shoes in total focus right here
and also Joe back there–!</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: I know what you want but it can’t be
done!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Take apart the fucking camera rig – we could
get a few more inches down and then tilt up–</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: Orson – we can’t get the fucking camera any
fucking lower so find another fucking shot!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Come on, Gregg! We’ll tear out this
floor!</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: It’s midnight, why don’t we pick it up
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Get me a jackhammer.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: There but for the grace of God, goes God.</p>
<p><strong>welles’ voice</strong>: Okay, Joe . . . come closer . . .
closer</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: “Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about
Miss Alexander, don’t bother. I’m not interested. I’ve set back the
sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that’s the way they
want it, the people have made their choice. It’s obvious the people
prefer Jim Gettys to me.”</p>
<p><strong>joseph cotton</strong>: “You talk about the people as if you
owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember,
you’ve talked about–” Orson, I am so goddamn tired–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Keep filming.</p>
<p><strong>joseph cotton</strong>: I can’t remember the lines!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Then make them up! You’re drunk and you’re
angry.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: This is the chance you’ve been waiting for,
boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!</p>
<p><strong>joseph cotton</strong>: We’re not all hopped up on
benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re not going to get another chance, boy!
Look right at the monster and you tell him–</p>
<p><strong>joseph cotton</strong>: “You don’t care about anything except
you. You just want to persuade people that you</p>
<p><strong>joseph cotton</strong>: love them so much that they ought to
love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. ”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: “A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own
terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own.”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Cut. Print</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How ’bout a real drink?</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: We done?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Good morning, good morning. . .</p>
<p><strong>hedda</strong>: Orson, Hedda here! You naughty boy! You told
me that I would be positively the first human soul to see your
masterpiece and here I read in the Reporter that there’s a screening
tonight for the magazines … yes, advance deadlines, I understand . . . .
. . oh, rough cut, uh-huh … Been there, Orson, know the drill. See ya
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>hedda</strong>: Get offa me, ya little prick</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: This is an abomination There’s no music
and–</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: They’ve all seen a rough cut</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: The magazines are one thing – but Hedda! Why
did we have to let her come?!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: When Hedda says “I’m coming” you mix a lot
of martinis and you pray.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What the hell did that mean?!</p>
<p><strong>hedda</strong>: Why hello, Mr. Hearst! I’m so delighted you
could take my call. I just wanted to let you know – I saw this Orson
Welles picture last night. First screening ever, don’t cha know, and,
Mr. Hearst, I don’t understand something . . . … I just don’t understand
why Louella hasn’t told you it ’ s all about you. . . Yes, oh yes . . .
My pleasure, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hedda</strong>: Take that, you old cow</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Here? As in right outside the door?</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Yes, sir</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Well, send her in!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Shit</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles
picture</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink,
would you like–?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: You drink at 10 am, do you?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: No – no – I mean–</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: I wanna see the picture today</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: That might be a tad difficult because
Orson is scoring the picture now and he’s very particular about the
music–</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself
wants me to see the picture today.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: He personally asked you to?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: That’s right</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Hearst?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Uh-huh</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: I’ll be back at noon. Set it up in
screening room four.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Oh god</p>
<p><strong>” kane “</strong>: “You’ll continue with your singing, Susan.
I don’t propose to have myself made ridiculous.”</p>
<p><strong>“susan alexander”</strong>: “You don’t propose to have
yourself made ridiculous I What about me?! I’m the one that’s got to do
the singing! I’m the one who gets the razzberries!”</p>
<p><strong>louella’s voice</strong>: It is . . . assassination.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: It’s all you. It has the political
campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the
castle. And … Marion.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career –
the man spending a fortune to make her a star – only it’s opera and not
movies. And…</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: The drinking.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: So my life is a subject for mockery. All of
it. Every detail. Every personal detail.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Thank you for your time</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Thank you, sir. She begins to leave</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Miss Parsons, I have one additional question
for you.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Why did we not know about this sooner?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes
and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple
service you are of no use to me.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Sir, I-</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Please be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: He lied to me</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: He looked into my face and told me it
wasn’t about you.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: And how do you feel when you are lied
to?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: I want blood</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish
you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Give me one dinner with her and I’ll sort it
out. Woman of a certain age are woefully susceptible to a younger man’s
charm. I’ll make myself so monumentally attractive that</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Oh Christ…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: This is the morning edition of the
EXAMINER.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: And this is the evening edition. Notice
anything?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: The ad..</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: They dumped our ad.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: They dumped all our ads.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Louis</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Randolph!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Hope you don’t mind my popping in–</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: What a wretched place this is. I can’t come
to town without feeling filthy. You really must buy that parcel of land
by the castle and come north.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have
you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Over at RKO?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Uh-hub.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Apparently it details the exploits of a
publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so
far?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I can’t see how the release of that picture
will do anyone any good, really.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Say, while I’m in town why don’t we play 18
holes at Bel Air? Or maybe just nine. Do you have time for a round
today?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and
Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: You know that can’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Oh, why is that?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Why is that, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Bel Air is restricted.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Oh, that’s right. How silly of me to have
forgotten. I sometimes forget that you’re all Jews. Lots of people
forget that. If they ever knew it.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE
picture, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: And you’ll come out to the castle soon, I
hope Marion and I would love to see more of you.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: That’s right, fella, no Hearst paper will
run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light
of day.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Louella, please, be reasonable, I
understand you have problems with Orson’s picture but maybe we can work
something out–</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Nix, sweetie. You shelve it</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Oh for God’s sake, Louella-</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell
you that you’re looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you
release this picture. He’ll bleed your little studio dry and you can all
go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Can I talk to Hearst?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: You are talking to him.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt
today.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You oughta lay off him – he is the
p-p-president, after all.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by
the end of the year. I think I’m going to run that wheelchair
picture.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Whaddaya think?</p>
<p><strong>willicombe</strong>: Sir, we got the call.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Thank you, Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Nothing for you to worry about, darling</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Pops</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: The S.E.C. has turned down my request for
relief on the debts.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: It’s not really–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: 125 million.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We’re 125 million dollars in debt?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How does one get 125 million dollars in
debt?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: One . . . buys things.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We open on Monument Valley. Those towering
stalagmites reaching up like pleading fingers to God. A single figure
treads the arid plains. The crimson sun is behind him so his shadow
stretches toward us. He is a simple man wearing a simple robe. A
profoundly quiet and sad man. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>bernard hermann</strong>: Orson, please..</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Who is he, Gregg?</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: Oh, no–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: He’s Christ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m Christ</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: You want to do the life of Jesus?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a
Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing
in the gallant American West–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Hey, kid. Gregg.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of
the new picture but I’ll go back–</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: No, you gotta hear this-</p>
<p><strong>bernard hermann</strong>: I’m trying to work here!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Sorry, you keep at it, old boy.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: You read Louella?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A
“puny upstart” or a “spoiled dilettante” – no, she wouldn’t know how to
spell that</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: “And how is the country to feel when this
industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees
instead of real Americans? Doesn’t Hollywood know there’s a Depression
on? Don’t real Americans deserve work?”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, at least she’s off KANE today</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: No she’s not. Don’t you get it, ya lunk? She’s
using code language to the studio bosses. “Bedraggled foreigners and
swarthy refugees” – who the hell do you think she’s talking about?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hedy Lamarr?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Jews. She’s talking about Jews.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn
studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word “Jew” and they
start sweating. Like Ester Williams’ pool they start sweating.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So they’re Jews. . .</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner
or later she’s gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is
only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that’s the
Jews.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Me, I’m proud to be a Jew, I got no problem.
You don’t like it, fuck you. But with these guys it’s like a dirty word.
All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way
they see it you can’t be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish
becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick – like
anyone’s gonna think he’s Irish for fuck’s sake–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What does this have to do with–?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Believe you me, they’re gonna do anything –
and I mean absolutely anything – to stop that word from gettin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that
what they’re going to do?!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Let me tell you a story, son So this was 1924,
right? Hearst was throwing a birthday party for Thomas Ince, the old
movie producer. They were all on the old man’s yacht taking a nice jaunt
from Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was. This was Hearst,
Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin, Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst
notices Marion slip off with Chaplin – she was screwing everyone then –
and the old man goes nuts. Grabs his revolver and starts shooting. Just
like Tom Mix, standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom - -
boom – boom – and Thomas Ince takes a bullet through the head. So now
there’s this dead guy lying on the deck. You’ll see how this could be
quite an embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice and quiet
and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No inquest and no police. It was
right after this that Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just
to keep her all hush-hush.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: If he had known about KANE before you made it,
you’d be dead already.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s too late. The movie’s made</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: They won’t let it out. Not Hearst. Not the
other studio heads–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren’t you
going to fight for it?!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I told you this was going to happen! I told
you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we
lost. That’s how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you –
and that’s what it’s all about – so fuck it and move on.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I WILL NOT MOVE ON! Let them do their worst!
These petty tyrants! These monstrous, small men Do they think they can
stop us? I Who are they?! Who are they?! THEY ARE . .. ACCOUNTANTS I</p>
<p><strong>bernard hermann</strong>: We’re ready. You want to hear
it?</p>
<p><strong>toland</strong>: His next picture … he wants to play
Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Hope he’s planning to start with the
crucifixion.</p>
<p><strong>“raymond”</strong>: “Throw that junk in, too.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Switch it off SWITCH IT OFF</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Would everyone please leave</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Well – he got us, didn’t he? She stands and
goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his
whore.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Marion–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of
his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: This picture–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I am not that woman.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I mean he’s even got the goddamn jigsaw
puzzles</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Why did he do that to us?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: And now of all times – NOW – when I am
grasping on with my fingernails to live at all this Orson We lies – this
insect – this reprehensible insect – has the nerve TO CHALLENGE ME! To
show my life as some cheap sideshow – A FREAK SHOW – A DYING,</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Mr. Willicombe – you have seen me in
adversity – you have seen me take on the unions and the Congress and the
railroads – and we have risen above – we have risen above. And if that
dog Welles thinks he can strike at me now – when he thinks I’m weak when
he thinks I’m vulnerable – then he does not fully comprehend the man is
facing.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Get me Louella Parsons, now!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: This upstart – this puny man – how does he
even dare to imagine he could comprehend my life and my world when he
crawls with the other insects in the sewer – in the dung – when we
control every moment of his life from the instant he is born to the
instant we decide that he will die! Does he have no idea of the power
that controls him?!</p>
<p><strong>willicombe</strong>: Mr. Hearst, I have Miss Par’</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Miss Parsons, Mr. Hearst. Use the file</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Now get me J. Edgar Hoover</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Then wake him up!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: That insect thinks he knows me! He thinks he
knows my capabilities! When his neck is in my teeth and his blood is in
my throat then he will know WILLIAM</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: So what do we got here, L.B.? We got
faggots and commies and junkies. We got movie stars screwing niggers and
little girls. We got killers and perverts and whores.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: We got MGM and Warner Brothers and Columbia
and Disney and Fox.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: We got Jews</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: We got Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: Kill CITIZEN KANE.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>louella</strong>: The boss is working on some stuff and I’m
working on some stuff. Now I want all you boys working on some stuff.
Cause if it looks like this picture’s ever gonna come out – I start
running down the street with these pictures like a screaming woman with
my throat cut, you follow?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Agent McCabe, if you please.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Open a new file. Heading: Welles, Orson.
Native born. Communist.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>willicombe</strong>: Miss Davies–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Come on Joe. How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>willicombe</strong>: It’s finished</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I’ve been thinking about the Tribune in
Chicago. The Examiner just can’t make any headway. Circulation is still
down. I think we should buy the Tribune.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Sure, Pops. That’s a swell idea</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: … and Rita Hayworth says: “You see, he truly
was the Son of God” … big Toland lighting effect … blah, blah, blah
…</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Sure, kid, come in. I’m writing the
crucifixion and it’s a bitch. Sit down</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: You guys after Orson too?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Shoot</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Shit, Orson’s no pink. He’s everything else
under the sun, but he’s no pink.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: No, I am not</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Stop it</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I think you better leave</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Get the fuck outta my house.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Don’t bother, you low-life prick</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Then you explain it to me?!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: There’s nothing to explain</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: A million dollars a year on art and
st-st-statues and there’s nothing to explain?!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I will not defend my life to you–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m not asking you to defend anything. But
we’re in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: We are in no “pickle” – as you would
euphemistically have it.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You gotta wake up now. Pops.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: There is nothing to discuss-</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You don’t have any money left, okay?! That’s
the truth. I don’t wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it’s the
truth. You spent it all. You can’t buy the Tribune in Chicago – you
can’t buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it–</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: You are being typically theatrical, Marion.
I need the Tribune to–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You don’t need it! That’s the problem you
always think you need everything–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That – did you need that? How much did that
cost?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: It’s 12th Century. From Deauville – in
France.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ’s
sake.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: You needn’t use that language with me</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Did you need it? Did you need any of it?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I wanted it</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There’s a different between want and</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: But why? Just so you can show it all off –
just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: That’s right. You’ve captured me exactly.
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You will not walk out on me</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: You are repellant when you drink.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about
this–</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: You are slovenly and unattractive and I
won’t t-t-t-tolerate it.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Fuck you, Mr. Kane.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I will not have this in my home.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I just want to understand–</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: No, you don’t. You want to condemn me, like
everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic
with his spending – trapped in his ridiculous</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: castle – still fighting old battles he will
never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I don’t want you to–</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: There is nothing to understand but this: I
am a man who could have been great, but was not.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55.
I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a
star.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: And he did.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: When I was making movies I kept begging him
to let me do comedies. Silly stuff, you know. But Pops doesn’t get
comedy too well so he kept putting me in all those godawful p-p-period
dramas.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I did my best but, well, you know me</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Sure</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thing that bothers me now, though, looking
back is that I really think I could have been something … special.</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Thinking like that is only gonna
drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta
be enough.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Yeah. But all of a sudden it’s not</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About
Pops and everything?</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Uh-huh</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The character that’s supposed to be me,
Susan Alexander–</p>
<p><strong>carole lombard</strong>: Marion, everyone knows you’re not
like that–</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: But I am That’s the killer, honey.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s hell when you gotta look back and say,
goddamn, what I could have been.</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I
might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me
b-b-because I don’t want anyone t-t-to, um, know that–</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Excuse me, I hope this isn’t rude, but
aren’t you Marion Davies?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss
Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the
revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you-</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Not one of them today has what you had,
Miss Davies. Not one of them.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you – b-b-but I’d really like
t-t-to–</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Of course, of course. How can we be of
service?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: As I said I have some j-j-j-j- that I might
wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate–</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: My Lord. . .</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How much for the lot?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio
City won’t premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some
bullshit about</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Then find another theater</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You don’t think I’ve tried? No one is
willing to open the picture</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Then we’ll open it in Detroit or Dallas or
Kalamazoo for God’s sake! We’ll show it in goddamn circus tents
and–!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Listen to me. The press ban is killing us
and the distributors won’t book it. And meantime I’m dealing with the
stockholders in New York who are scared shitless – and I’m this far from
getting fired myself – and you don’t have a friend in the world but me
right now. So you have got to trust that I’ll do what I can to–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: “Do what you can”?! That’s not good enough
I</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Well it’ s all you’ve got !</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re with them, aren’t you? You’re going
to bury my movie. They bought you!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: For Christ’s sake, shut up–</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Why don’t you just have the guts to admit
it</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: How dare you talk to me like that! Do you
think I’m like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is
that what you think–?!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s just that my movie is so-</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: “Your movie” – I am so sick of that! It’s
your movie – but it’s his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you
ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore
them apart?!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Do you every think for one second that you
might have some responsibility for what you’re doing?! For cutting and
slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That soulless monster gets no tears from
me.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You
are that soulless monster.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Recognize</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It’s Tara. From GONE WITH THE WIND</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s … sad</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Not really. It’s only a set, after all
Just lumber. .</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You know, we make all these pictures, we
turn em out one after another, without thinking most of the time. Just
like making toasters or Packards or toothpaste. But then sometimes …
something amazing happens and you get a GONE WITH THE WIND.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: And no one can ever take that away from
you.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: … and in financial news, rumors
continue to swirl around the head of publishing baron William Randolph
Hearst. . .</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: … Sources report that the Hearst
Empire is facing some rocky times ahead as the press lord is facing
mounting debts and shrinking revenues due to over expansion and fiscal
mismanagement that have resulted in…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I started out as a gold-digger, ya know But
goddamn if I didn’t fall in love with the guy.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Mr. Zanuck … Mr. Warner … Mr. Cohn Mr. Disney
.. . Mr. Goldwyn . . . Mr. Selznick.</p>
<p><strong>jack warner</strong>: He’s a fucking punk, why does Hearst
give a shit?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: It’s enough that he does</p>
<p><strong>sam goldwyn</strong>: Would Louella really do it?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: In a New York minute</p>
<p><strong>david 0. selznick</strong>: I say to hell with Louella and to
hell with Hearst! Bring ’em on. We can take em.</p>
<p><strong>harry cohn</strong>: We all didn’t make GONE WITH THE WIND,
ya know. Some of us gotta look at this checkbook-wise.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Who isn’t hurting already? All this Jew talk
and these Communist rumors. Look, he’s boycotting RKO ads right now –
but how long before he takes on Warners or Fox or Columbia?</p>
<p><strong>harry cohn</strong>: Goddamn right.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: And if Hearst goes public with all this
filthy private lives stuff, Hollywood’s sunk. He’s got us nailed. Dates.
Times. Photographs for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>walt disney</strong>: I don’t mean to be funny, but what
could he have on Mickey Mouse?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: He’s got you so tied in with J. Edgar Hoover
and America First that you might as well put on a brown shirt and kiss
those happy little kiddies so-long.</p>
<p><strong>david 0. selznick</strong>: Have any of you actually seen the
movie?</p>
<p><strong>david 0. selznick</strong>: I have. It’s probably the
greatest motion picture ever made. Nothing’s going to be the same after
this. With this one movie he’s changed the way we see–</p>
<p><strong>jack warner</strong>: Who the fuck cares?</p>
<p><strong>david 0. selznick</strong>: I do. And so should all of
you–</p>
<p><strong>jack warner</strong>: Get off the soapbox–</p>
<p><strong>david 0. selznick</strong>: I want no part of this. We should
be marching into George Schaefer’s office and standing with him. He’s
one of us!</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: David-</p>
<p><strong>david 0. selznick</strong>: If I ever got into trouble I’d
like to think that you all would be with me – not planning to stab me in
the back like a bunch of … a bunch of … producers!</p>
<p><strong>jack warner</strong>: Your son-in-law meshuaena.</p>
<p><strong>disney</strong>: He’s got me and Hoover?</p>
<p><strong>jack warner</strong>: Relax, Walt, at least he don’t have you
screwing Snow White. I got fucking Errol Flynn on my payroll!</p>
<p><strong>sam goldwyn</strong>: You’re a smart man, L.B. I suspect you
would not have called us here without a plan. Give over.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: We will buy the movie and we will destroy
it.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: We will assemble a fund between us –
privately, ’not studio money – we will assemble this fund and we will go
to George Schaefer and we will buy the negative and every print of
CITIZEN KANE and we will burn them.</p>

<p><strong>marion</strong>: Mr. Hearst spent his life collecting that

<p><strong>lewis</strong>: We’ve been in touch with Gimbels in New York
and they’ve agreed to hold a special sale. They’re giving over an entire
floor for the merchandise. You’ll have to go there in person to sign the
bill of sale, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I’ll have to sell the animals.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: And we don’t know whether we’ll be able to
retain the castle. The land has some capital and we might keep it on as
an investment. Maybe break it up into smaller units for housing.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: When will it come out? When will the public
know?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: We can’t keep it a secret, sir. Once we
announce the Gimbels sale and start liquidating the assets.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: This is your whole life. Pops. Don’t do it.
We’ll find another way..</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Next up we have a real treat. It’s Orson

some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with

<p><strong>bunny berigan</strong>: “I’ve flown around the world in a
plane, I’ve settled revolutions in Spain, And the North Pole I have
charted, Still I can’t get started with you…</p>
<p><strong>bunny berigan</strong>: “On the golf course I’m under par,
Metro Goldwyn has asked me to star, I’ve got a house, a show place,

something else.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I think you better sit down</p>

to buy the film and destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for
the negative and all the prints.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: And they went to the stockholders in New
York.</p>

<p><strong>welles</strong>: Let . . . me . . . talk to them. . .</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Old man Hearst owned this and I’m getting it
for two bits I</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I can’t sell this. How much are they
asking?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Pops … let it go. Just … let it go</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Yes, I think I shall.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Six of spades</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Six of spades</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Today.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Today a man from Germany invaded Greece. He
has already swallowed Poland and Denmark and Norway and Belgium. He is
bombing London as I speak. Everywhere this man goes he crushes the life
and the freedom of his subjects. He sews yellow stars onto their lapels.
He takes their voices.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: We open on May 1st.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Orson, what you said in there. Did you
mean it?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Does it matter? They believed it</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Orson.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Yes. It matters.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mr. Hearst, we’ve met once before, my name
is Orson Welles and I’ve got a movie opening tomorrow night at the
Palace. I would be pleased to get you tickets.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have
done?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: Intimately. For every sin you have placed on
my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood
my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old
fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should
not be public property.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Elegant words, sir, when you have made your
name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers
you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee
of the master.</p>
<p><strong>hearst</strong>: So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles?
What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do
anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no
price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each
other to pieces just to be heard?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: They’re cutting us dead, every goddamn
one.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s my birthday this week. I’ll be 26.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He
wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Herman.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: So ain’t this just the bee’s knees? The high
muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You gonna watch?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Hell, I know how it ends. Hey, Rosebud’s the
sled!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mank!</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Face it, Orson, they’re gonna hate it. I told
you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York
actors.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Oh God. . .</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Relax, George. It’s gonna go great. Trust
me. Have I ever lied to you?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You know something, Orson, you haven’t
done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I’d do
it again in a second.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It was fun, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It was the best, kid</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So, on to the Life Of Christ!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Without me. I’m afraid. I got the axe this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Shit</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: George…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Forget it. Cause you know something..</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Aw, cheer up, George’ll probably be running
Fox by the morning. Let’s get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: But the picture…</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Kid, you know how it ends too. It ends
sadly.</p>
<p><strong>“kane”</strong>: “Rosebud…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You know, all this nightmare we went through
with Hearst. The whole thing… And in the end, probably no one will ever
remember the picture anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: Yeah, you’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>mank</strong>: I’ll tell ya something, kid. When you make
your masterpiece at 26 it’s a bitch. I mean. where do you go from
here?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Will burn. Burn up. Burn out. But oh, what a
flame</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Cheers.</p>
