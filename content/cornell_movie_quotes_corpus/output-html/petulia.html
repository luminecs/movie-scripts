<h1 id="petulia">petulia</h1>
<p><strong>night</strong>: The story begins in this grubby alley, where
two extra large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading platform.
Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to see how many people died;
nobody died, the backdoors of the ambulances are opened by attendants,
and six perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile
accidents are lifted into wheelchairs. The cripples are beautifully
dressed, the men in tuxedos, the women in splendid evening dresses. One
of the women wears a neck brace which forces her always to look skyward,
so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage pinned to her bosom.
Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the stacks of fruit
and vegetables on the loading platform, past great bales of laundry,
past whatever horrors one finds behind the warm, smiling face of a
hotel. Watch- men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the
wheelchairs without much interest. Then doors swing open, and we are in
the tram It of the grand ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>2 into grand ballroom</strong>: It is a charity ball. The
sign says “Shake for Highway Safety.”’ The wheelchairs and their
occupants no longer interest us. They are the guests of honor, and
people gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we rush past
the go-go band, the shakers, and the door prize, which is a little
convertible, spinning endlessly on a pedestal. CAMERA reaches PETULIA,
who is dancing with her husband, DAVID, but trying not to lose sight of
ARCHIE. ARCHIE really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it
too obvious. As he bends over to put his punch cup on a table, he is
bumped by the wheelchair of one of the guests of honor. He is not at all
comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: It’s not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on
Archie; gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies get in
the way, and the dance won’t end. The music stops for a second, everyone
sags and thinks, “Thank God it’s over,” but instantly the music begins
again and everyone good naturedly swears, “Those crazy kids are trying
to kill us,” and meanwhile Petulia sees that Archie has reached the
place where you get your coat.</p>
<p><strong>med. archie</strong>: He is searching through his pockets for
the ticket that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats are in an
incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical care of a debutante
attendant.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’ s voice</strong>: You can’t leave He turns and sees
Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You’re an official host. She nods to the
ribbon and cardboard which along with ‘Official Host’ says Dr. A.
Bollen. Archie takes the ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Careful. Can you tell I’m not wearing a
brassiere?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Don’t think about it. It will only excite
you. Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the attendant
now tries to find. On through this Petulia continues.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: That’s my husband over there,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Ahh …</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ve been married six months and I’ve never
had an affair,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It can happen</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Don’t take it so bloody well. I’ve just
turned you down. He’s looking at us. My husband,</p>
<p><strong>med. david with his mother and father</strong>: somewhere
near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod, which, of course, they
don’t have. The father is watching the charity affair with utter
disapproval. He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen raffle tickets
into the waiter’s jacket pocket,</p>
<p><strong>mr, danner</strong>: I hope you win the car, sir, Mrs. Danner
is charmed by her husband’s generosity. She simply adores the man. David
is busy not watching Archie and Petulia,</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Isn’t he gorgeous? He’s a naval
architect. It really zings when you say it. “My husband David is a naval
architect.” Actually, we’re starving. You wouldn’t want to buy a sixty
foot sloop? David’s “Momma”` and “Poppa’ keep us. Look how disgusted
Poppa is. He hates this sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>archieis voice</strong>: Poppa is too sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Sensitive, my ass. He’s bored.
Highway safety’s so blah. Also, he hates amateurs. Give him something he
can sink his teeth into - “Rheumatoid Arthritis” ® “Muscular Dystrophy”’
-m and he’s the best there is. A real pro. A little lame girl with a
ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her arm, and Poppa can set the
world on fire. He’s really slumming tonight.</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: Hello, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>med. petulia and archie</strong>: have been joined by BARNEY
and WILMA, Archie’s best friends. Barney and Wilma are taking off their
coats. Barney is already beginning to move to the music. 0 Wilma is
doing absolutely nothing but looking at Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Everybody came late.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I came early. G’bye Wilma. G’bye Barney.</p>
<p><strong>debutante attendant</strong>: Could you describe the
coat?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: A. coat. A raincoat. Sleeves. Barney has
begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders, becoming part of “The
Scene”, about which Wilma couldn’t care less.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: You can’t go, Archie. I’d be very</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Archie accepts this silently,</p>
<p><strong>wi lma</strong>: Alright, then. I won’t tell you who I bumped
into last week</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: buying a well larded rib roast.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Smarty. Have you seen what she’s done to her
hair?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Wild, huh?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I said, “Polo, for heaven’s sake, you look
like a teenager.” Archie doesn’t seem too interested and, besides, all
this is said while Wilma continues to look at Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Your Mike’s getting so fat. Is that much
weight good for a boy his age?</p>
<p>****: If it’s alright for a rib roast</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Smarty. Barney suddenly forgets the music to
rescue his Vicuna coat which the debutante is smothering under other
coats as she finally finds Archie’s.</p>
<p><strong>w ilma</strong>: I don’t believe we’ve met.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Screw you, Wilma.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Now you’ve met.</p>
<p><strong>2 continued</strong>: Wilma moves off with Barney. Archie
can’t spend one more second with his coat. He simply puts it on, and
turns to leave, walking toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: My name is Petulia,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Itm not surprised,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Polo’s your wife,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Ex-wife, G’ night. Petulia turns to face her
husband David, who has taken a few steps toward her. She whirls around
to face the departing Archie.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Archie! He turns, almost at the door.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Say something warm.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I mean it There is something goofily
desperate in her voice that stops him. He looks at her for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Your hair, It gleams.</p>
<p>****: Oh, Archie…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Left arm or right? How do you brush it?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Left.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: An hour a day.</p>
<p><strong>0 petulia</strong>: At least.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You’ 11 have a problem. The bursa sheath.
Very sensitive, Bursitis. It’ll hurt.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ll come to you.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I wouldn’t be able to help much. Just
aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: And sympathy?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>**_. petulia**: Thank you, Archie. Damn it, how can I have an affair
with an unmarried man. There has to be some equality of guilt.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: My divorce doesn’t become final till
next</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ll get my purse. But in turning to do so
she sees David, then the spinning car, the door prize.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ve been told that I’ll be the one to draw
the winning ticket. I’m always picked for things like that. I radiate
incorruptibility. Money can’t buy me. She shakes her head, thoughtfully.
During all this the door- man has been busily opening and closing the
door for them as they keep changing their mind.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: It feels so super. Suddenly, all that
love.</p>
<p><strong>archie’s voice</strong>: Well, stay then.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Archie, why do you play this dumb game?
This crappy pretense at resisting the beautiful lady? You’re bloody
lucky I’m even talking to you. How many kids do you have besides fat
Mike?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: G’night.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Actually, only one besides Mike.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Meet you outside.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You mustn’t take it personal. Lucky we
don’t have luggage.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Does this trouble you?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I suggested my place.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: Archie sees a car moving through the
processes of E registration. Grabbing Petulia’s hand, he starts to what
is presumably the entrance – at least it is the bottom of the ramp. They
arrive at the booth and Archie steps on the. place marked ‘Stand Here.’
A T.V. screen lights up.</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: Evenin’. Where’s your auto? Archie nods
for Petulia to see the T.V. camera which is scanning them.</p>
<p><strong>petu lia</strong>: Lost in a hailstorm this side of
Pocatello, Idaho. Those hailstones really came down, didn’t they,
Zeke?</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: No auto?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No auto.</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: It’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Only if we make it one.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Do you have any slides or swings for
children?</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: No, ma’am. You got kids?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: No, no. I was told to be suspicious of
motels which cater to the family trade.</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: This isn’t that sort of place. No
auto.</p>
<p><strong>well</strong>: There is a small sound and a gadget reaches
out which normally would fasten to the side of the car. On it is an
electronic register, an electronic pen and a key with a great metal tag
designed, I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los . As Archie
registers, and puts the ten dollar bill where it belongs, Petulia looks
at the T.V. set.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: s Continued</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You’ve got a very nice T,V, face.</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: Thank you, ma’ amp,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You have to use pancake make-up, things
like that?</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: No, just be natural. Archie has finished
registering and takes the keys.</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: We’ve got an elevator but its just for
going out for the paper and the like. I mean when you don’t want to take
the car. You’ll have to use the ramp because of the key. It lets you
know when you get to your room.</p>
<p>****: It shouldn’t be charming. You’re missing the whole point. It
should be menacing .,, Another couple in a proper car, rushes by. There
is a blaze of headlights, and a rush of sound.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: ,..gray . terribly distraught headlights of
passing cars lighting up our room .,. Archie tugs at her, and gasps.</p>
<p>****: … a police car careening down the highway, sirens going full
blast. And I plunge madly into your arms But she is now totally winded
and cannot say another word. Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny
light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off furiously. Just
ahead of him is the door of their motel room. Archie is aghast at the
pulsating key.</p>
<p>****: My apartment’s only four blocks from</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You have 624 women in this room and I’m
still counting. Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top
buttons on the back of her dress.</p>
<p>****: Just wait a minute, okay? Archie plops on the bed in his coat,
a most iropic smile on his face – he is beginning to suspect he is not
going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia faces in the
mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: My great-grandmother is ninety-one and
still has a granite chin. Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it
begins to vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on endless
beds.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: What a lecherous lot</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: She’s ninety-ones eh?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: But no fun.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Not at ninety-one, hell</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when
her husband was killed in the first war, in a trench looking just like
Cary Grant with a waxed moustache. She can’t remember him but she does
remember Cary Grant because he is from Bristol, too, and often in the
news. If his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed moustache whether
he likes it or not. She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is
angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one moment to the next.
But she knows he shouldn’t be in an overcoat jiggling on a jiggling
bed,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Stop being so damn casual. Archie sits up
but is still casual,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: We’re about �td become lovers, Did you
bring an instrument, Archie?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Ring for room service. Ask the robot for
something splendid and musical,,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Saxophone? Electric Organ? Tuba?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: A tuba. Absolutely; Bless you, Ar–hie; A
tuba; Something large and twirly and pom to pom .pomX Archie, this is an
event. We 0 are about to become lovers.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You said that.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: It can’t be said often enough.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Are we?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Are we what?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: About to become lovers?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Ah, you swinging young marrieds. He
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Where do you have to rush? If we were
making love you would be exploring my navel about now. Time would be the
last thing on your mind. An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast
with the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of his car. The
elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie enter,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You. look like a gargoyle. Poor, dumb
Archie. I’m all mixed up sexually. Old Mum’s a prostitute. The oldest
professional lady in 0 all Bristol. Mavis, too, my sister. But I mean
she’s not a landmark yet.</p>
<p><strong>9 continued</strong>: During this Archie notices that the
back of Petulia’s dress remains unbuttoned. He moves behind her and
begins rebuttoning her. At the touch of his hand, something happens to
Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Real honest-to-God tears, Petulia?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Tears, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia, you’re a kook. He exits the
elevator and whistles at a cruising cab.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: If he gets you there in time, you can still
pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Archie, I’m going to marry you. The cab
pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him through the rear
window. Archie allows himself the drollest of smiles.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It’s the Pepsi generation 0 He walks into
the night alone.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m up, thanks. Then his dizzy brain
realizes the ringing is continuing and is constant. He sees the alarm
clock, 6:1 He stumbles and staggers to the front door.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah… yeah 000 yeah 000 He opens the door to
come face to face with the large and twirly front end of a tuba. The
tuba is stark white for no particular reason.</p>
<p><strong>arc hie</strong>: I’ll make some coffee. Petulia blows with
all her strength, emitting a sad little peep, then collapses to the
floor, tuba and all.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Aren’t I a kook? If you think you’re</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No, I’ve been up for hours, waiting for the
doorbell to ring,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: , 0 think how surprised the-man who owns
the pawnshop is going to be when he sees all that broken glass.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Archie, how come the burglar alarm
didn’t go off?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Wherets it all going to end if the burglar
alarms won’t go off? Take me to bed, Archie,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Get the hell out of here . please. He
reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches her waist to lift
her, she screams and faints,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ve got a broken rib, I think, I can feel
it broken, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Don’t you know you can puncture a lunge</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Hopping around with tubas and stuff – isntt
it kooky, though? Archie has begun to remove her dress.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: When are we going to stop trying to undress
me?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Leave me alone, Archie. Archie sees she
really means it,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: That’s why. Call a proper doctor,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: A hairy legged old lecher running around in
pajama bottoms,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Get your clothes off,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: As a woman, not as a rib. Archie is
harassed. The phone begins ringing. He grabs it angrily.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m awake! I’m awake; How many times are you
gonna call?I He hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up
call.</p>
<p><strong>e archie</strong>: You know what a- you’ll drive me cuckoo.
He sighs. and begins dialing a number. Petulia is in real pain. Like
a,little child she crawls under the covers of his bed, pulling the quilt
up around her as though Archie’s left over warmth will make the pain go
away.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Barney? Archie. Fine fine , , fine , I want
you to look at a patient for me. Now. At my place. My apartment, Barney,
it’s very complicated and I haven’t had my morning coffee yet. Her name
is Petulia. I don’t know her last name, Barney. Yes, Petulia. Barney,
shut up. I have to get to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>16a barney’s bedroom morning</strong>: During the above we
catch a glimpse of sleepy Barney sleepily asking stupid questions.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You’ve got a super build for a man your
age. Archie says nothing. He crosses to the bathroom and hastily begins
dressing.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Where are all the family pictures? Archie
is busy brushing his teeth,</p>
<p>****: The family pictures! He looks out from the bathroom
blankly,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Polo and the boys.</p>
<p><strong>• petulia</strong>: I’ll bet you named her Polo. Don’t ever
start mucking about with “Petulia”. Archie exits from the bathroom, all
the time continuing to dress,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: What°s her real name?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Prudence.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: And you named her Polo. That’s kind of
sickening, Archie. Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this
girl in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba. Archie sighs
somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as you’d think.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I want him here every day. For therapy.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Si, Yes, doctor. I do, Oliver speaks only a
few words of English, mostly the necessary scatological and sexual
phrases that would be necessary in his line of business.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Every day. Tell him that. The woman says it
to Oliver in Spanish. Oliver says something obviously obscene.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p>****: He say yes.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You sure? Otherwise we keep you in the
hospital. You’re not well, just better. Say that. The woman tells Oliver
in Spanish as Archie continues examining the leg.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Sorry, pal. Oliver says something in
Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Every day. Same time. Two o’clock, right on
the dot. The last bit of glass falls Sorry , , Oliver swears in Spanish
and the woman clacks her tongue.</p>
<p>****: He terrible.</p>
<p>****: I like the way he heals.</p>
<p><strong>17 continued</strong>: Archie smiles and leaves. The nurse is
left with Oliver who avoids her touch,</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Cut that out, you little spit,</p>
<p><strong>18 tnt. corridor</strong>: Archie stops to hear what the
woman has to say.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: About the bill, Doctor. Barney is passing
by.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Is she okay?</p>
<p>****: Lunch. Archie looks up at the woman.</p>
<p><strong>• archie</strong>: His leg will be fine. Don’t worry too much
about the bill. Just enough to pay it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I have money to pay it, A pipe smoking public
relations man leads a casually dressed group past Archie and the
woman.</p>
<p><strong>public relations man</strong>: Yea, we had ABC filming a
documentary here last week</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Springtime in Paree. Our elegante dinner
pajamas. In airy aquamarine chiffon and Mediterranean blue peau de soie.
Delightfully carefree, yet formal enough for an ambassadorial reception
at the Palace of Versailles.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: “Screw you, Wilma.” Why didn’t you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Oh, great, terrific, you wouldn’t believe
it. Terrific. And her rib?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I taped it. Gave her some seconal. • Should
have a vertical just to be safe. A waitress hovers</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Why do we have to eat topless?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: The best Irish stew in town. He is eating a
corned beef sandwich. Archie is ordering the same.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: She said you beat her up. Kidding, of
course. Archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm. Breasts
with their pasties always intrude.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You must have been a little rough on her,
daddy.</p>
<p><strong>19 continued</strong>: The second model, a beautiful topless
Negress, is now wandering past the tables. The announcer goes on and
on.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Opening Night at the Opera. Though the
curtain has risen on the first act of Aida, all eyes are on the Royal
Box, Mi Lady in dazzling velvet: Cardinal Richelieu Rouge. The utter
simplicity of her full-length gown is subtly accented by the merest
suggestion of gay abandon. Archie eats his sandwich. An off-duty topless
waitress sits in the corner having lunch, holding a napkin over her
bosom with one hand, while eating with the other.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Archie ?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Barney ?</p>
<p>****: You know how long I’ve known you?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Forever?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: That’s how long. And Polo and the kids.
That’s exactly how long. Another silence. Archie is watching the brass
pole. Every other girl sliding down looks like Petulia. Archie accepts
his hallucination with mild pleasure. Barney will not be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: So I have a right to my opinion;
It’s breaking Wilma’s heart; That’s all we talk about. You think you’re
different than anybody else? Every time I leave my house it’s the last
time, I’m never coming back. You’re not listening to me, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie’s voice</strong>: Barney, for Chrissake, I’m listening
to you,</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: You’re thinking about that hot cat
in your bed, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>19 continued</strong>: Now, in the continuous luncheon
fashion show, the “Psychedelic Yvonne” has appeared, topless amid a wild
pattern of lights, The dialogue between Barney and Archie continues
elsewhere as the orgy of colors becomes:</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: My record is far from spotless, if
you don’t know that, who does? But baby, it’s just not the answer, not
at our age.</p>
<p><strong>archie’s voice</strong>: So what’s the answer, baby?</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: • Someplace you can belch without
saying excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>archie’s voice</strong>: I can do that in the steam room at
the YMCA.</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: And if a little monkey business
comes along, whose gonna throw rocks? You and Polo were a marvellous
looking couple.</p>
<p><strong>10 barney’s voice</strong>: Is there something wrong with
being a groovy looking couple? People turning around to stare? What was
it, Archie? The sex bit? Huh? The ole sex bit ,,,?</p>
<p><strong>archie’s voice</strong>: Barney, what would you say if I told
you that one day I just got very tired of being married?</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: It’s still better than being out
there in the dark, all by your goddam lonesome! Nobody has a life
anymore. Quicksand, It scares me. What do you want, Archie?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know what I want. To feel something,</p>
<p>****: That’s no answer; Archie, grow up! The ball comes whizzing at
Barney who suddenly wants it to hit him, which it does,</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Archie, what am I going to do about
Wilma?</p>
<p>****: Hey, you. She opens her eyes, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m drunk.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It’s the stuff Barney gave you.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m drunk.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’ll drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Thank you, I’ll take the bus.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Don’t pry, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: How’m I prying?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ll go home by bus.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: If I were prying, I would ask you how you
broke your rib. Right?</p>
<p><strong>pe tulia</strong>: You fall on a tuba and you break your rib.
Right.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Wrong. The rib was broken hours before your
fall. L’ During this the bus comes to a stop. Petulia rises shakily to
board it but she can’t go through the entrance with the tuba.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: Anytime you’re ready, Lady.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’ll keep it for you.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: It has to be returned. “Friends of the
Evergreen,” Archie looks blank.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: It’s a lodge. In Chinatown. On Grant. Ask
for Mr. Howard. The bus driver really leans on his horn to make
everything charming.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia, take a cab!</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Will you remember that? “Friends of the
Evergreen.”</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Mr. Howard. Tell him I’m sorry I goofed.
Archie, you know something? The tuba makes you look ten years younger,
and . you’know … Thingy 0 The bus starts with a jolt and Petulia winces
in pain.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Petulia?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just before —</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … for a split second there</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Ism okay.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought maybe you</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: David. Somehow or other we begin to sense
that madness has entered what is really a commonplace scene. Something
has gone wrong and we can’t for the life of us under- stand what and
before we can even guess, we are:</p>
<p><strong>evergreen” day.</strong>: The sign on the door identifies
this as a fraternal organization, founded in 1886 for the betterment of
man, but the door is securely padlocked for the night. Archie stands
there, holding the tuba and feeling stupid. Haplessly, he returns to his
car and begins stowing the tuba inside, banging it against his nose in
the process. He is a far from happy man.</p>
<p><strong>in a slum house day</strong>: Petulia is filling the noisy
old electric ice box with milk, ice cream and fresh fruit. A man enters
from another room. He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican. He has just
awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and is hairy, sweaty and fat.
Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which the man answers a
non-committal grunt. He squeezes past Petulia to drink from the sink. He
sticks his head under the tap.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I came by to make sure there was enough
milk and things. He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past
Petulia to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a possible
relationship between Petulia and this man. In the next room a screen
door opens and closes. Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she
see Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>30 continued</strong>: Polo looks about the apartment
dubiously, from tuba to unmade bed. She can’t keep her eyes off the
unmade bed.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Hi, Polo.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: It’s very nice. Archie looks at her
questioningly.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: I’ve never been here before. It’s very
nice.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: It’s strange, coming into your husband’s
bachelor apartment for the first time. Feels slightly illegal. Is that a
tuba?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That’s a tuba.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Make a marvelous lamp.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You just had to say it.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Predictable Polo.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: “Predictable Polo.” Has a certain zing.
How’re the kids?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Looking forward to the weekend. Lest I forget
She opens her large handbag, takes out a cellophane bag of cookies.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: As usual, I baked enough for an army.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: This is very strange. I didntt think I’d feel
like this. Mostly sad. Archie’s sad, too, therefore he is more brusque
than necessary. Also he is bugged by the cookies.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You need anything, Polo?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: No. Well, yes. Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>****: I think that covers all the possibilities. Polo laughs,
suddenly they share a moment of warmth.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: It’s such a puzzle. We really got on so
marvelously. Never fought. Never screamed at each other. Not once. •
Something in his silence, plus that damned unmade bed, is beginning to
make her angry.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Everybody we knew envied us.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: We were a handsome couple. This makes her so
angry she can now say what she came to say.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: I think I’ve fallen in love. The man is Warren
Smith. He’s an engineer and very good with the children, but he wants to
go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics. Well, say
something.</p>
<p>****: I think that’s fine, Polo.</p>
<p>****: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>0 30 continued</strong>: Tie phone begins ringing. Archie
crosses to it.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Were going to’be married.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Great. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: She stops. She waits for a moment,
wondering if the scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur.
Will David now say, “Just for a second there .?”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on, let’s eat. Morrie finally got a
shipment of Dungeness crab.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: About time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, poor guy. They had all that trouble.
David crosses to the dining area. And that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Not right away. He’s also divorced. There’s
alimony … child support It looks absolutely obscene.</p>
<p>****: So the kids like him, eh?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Adore him.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: How about that?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Don’t you have maid service?</p>
<p>****: What the hell are you doing, bringing me cookies? He flings the
bag at her, barely missing her. They are both stunned by this
outburst,</p>
<p><strong>’olo</strong>: • Well … this is a new side of your natured
For two people who never fight Absently, Polo sags down on the edge of
the unmade bed, which has so fascinated her. During the following, no
matter what their bodies happen to be doing, Polo and Archie continue to
speak in a most logical manner.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What’s so great about not fighting?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: I came to tell you about Warren,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You told me about Warren. He sits beside
her, well not really beside her, actually as far away from her as the
bed will permit. She decides she will instantly get up off the bed, but
she does not.</p>
<p>****: Warren is working for his m’tstah’s in hydraulics.</p>
<p><strong>0 32 continued</strong>: Polo knows she shouldn’t smile at
Archie making fun of Warren, but she does. Archie touches her smile with
his finger, then his hand moves across her face, to the back of her
neck. It is a clumsy gesture and they clumsily sprawl on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Well, I’m afraid well still need all the money
you pay me. And I’ll be seeing him, Archie</p>
<p><strong>polo is voice</strong>: , ., at the house. I mean until
Warren</p>
<p>****: until he is established with some hydraulics firma I hope it
won’t be too long, I mean for everybody’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: If he’s a bright guy, he’ll make out
okay.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Needless to say there are certain problems. By
now, Archie is on top of Polo, and out of habit she is adjusting her
body for him.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: He lives in such a depressing, rented room. It
gives me claustrophobia.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Poor Polo.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: It’s such an icky little room. Archie is,
perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo, when he suddenly sits up,
wondering what the hell he’s been doing. He walks to the far side of the
room, sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt across his
face. Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was totally
unplanned, and she has no more desire to “make it” with Archie than he
has with her. She pulls down her skirt and adjusts her garters.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Tell the kids I’ll come for them 0 Sunday at
eight.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: They’ll be ready. I thought the decent thing
was to come here and talk in a civilized manner. About the change in my
situation.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I appreciate it, Polo.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Good night, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You’ve got a run in your stocking. Polo
exits, Archie can’t figure out why in the world he even thought of
making love to Polo after all this time. He sits down on the unmade bed,
finds one of Polo’s cookies on the sheets, and pops it into his
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>33 continued</strong>: LARGE GUARD with a bull horn is
keeping people moving on the Japanese bridge. Many soldiers on pass, a
few hippies, but mostly just tourists.</p>
<p><strong>large guard</strong>: Now you folks keep moving along that
bridge. You keep moving along and give other folks a chance. There’s
lots of pretty things to do. You keep moving right along. You won’t want
to forget our Niponese souvenir pagoda where every item is the real
McCoy. That’s right. Keep moving, that’s the ticket. Sergeant, you’ve
been standing there some time now. During this, MAY and Archie talk. ’.s
32 and pretty. Its a nice day but Archie is not happy. Polo, Warren,
maybe Petulia mostly it’s kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor, . and
May have been sitting on the grass. Gracefully she rises to her feet,
doing everything just right, even this. 0 She puts away her portable
martini kit.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Nobody in the world can sit on the grass and
not wrinkle. She looks.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No, perfect. Not even a blade of grass. Why
don’t I marry you, May?</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Why don’t you, Ar^hie? They walk along holding
hands. Archie should feel better than he does.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Tell me about Bobby Kennedy. She looks at
him, smiling.</p>
<p>****: Picasso? Pickles? She smiles tolerantly as they walk along.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Choose a subject. Ice cubes. Any damn thing.
Take either side. Talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes.</p>
<p>****: Why the hostility, Archie?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That dress shop of yours. “Boutique.” I’ve
never seen one of those … your rubber mannequins .. I’ve never once seen
the pipe sticking out of their bottoms. Not once, not one damn time.
That bothers me, May. May stops. She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed
or amused. Shets a little of both.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m not hostile, it’s frustration. In all
that perfection, how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in?
I mean, without spoiling the whole effect. They have now reached the
area of the stunted trees. Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids
are improvising on the stage and shouting.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Don’t worry about it. You’ll be going back to
Polo.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No, she’s found a fellah.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Oh. She watches the kids for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: I’d just about given up on you,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What I should do is marry you. For May this
has been said once too often. She is now</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Archie, if it would please you, I’ll submit a
list of my faults, some of which might shake you up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It would be a fake list.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Probably, It wouldn’t be a fake list. Actually,
I wear arch supports, my depilatory causes a nasty little rash, and I’ve
lost 10% of my hearing in less than a year .. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>okay;</strong>: They laugh, kiss, grab at each other, and
hurry toward the parking lot for Archie’s car.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Well of all people.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: All that crap about the humanitarian- ism
of the medical profession. She darts alongside the building and begins
frantically calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an
“aloha” hat, May looks at Archie questioningly.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Don’t ask. Petulia and the old man are back
joining Archie and May on the steps.</p>
<p>****: Archie, this is Mr. Howard.</p>
<p><strong>0 mr. howard</strong>: I was looking at the foundation. Once
in a while you find one from before the earthquake. It’s a thrill,
believe you me.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Mr. Howard is the’watchman for the “Friends
of the Evergreen.” Or was.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: The tuba.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: No wonder people are becoming cynical about
doctors.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I tried to return it. The place was
locked.</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: No harm done,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: • I didn’t expect this of you, Archie’.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I tried to return the tuba Friday</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: It’s O.K.</p>
<p>****: The “Friends of the Evergreen” are very proud of their brass
band.</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: All’s well that ends well.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Stay out of this, Mr. Howard. She sees May
watching all this with wry amusement.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m Petulia Danner. I’m sorry about
this.</p>
<p><strong>mr . howard</strong>: She said there was this elderly lady
whose first husband used to play tuba with John Phillip Sousa. She said
it would cheer her up and make her want to live. She gave me five
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: All that broken glass</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: Its okay. Archie crosses to the front
door and opens it.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Howard. Goodbye, Petulia.
Petulia crosses to Mr. Howard and presses a dollar bill into his shirt
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Take a taxi. You can at least say you’re
sorry, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr, Howard. Goodbye, Petulia. But
Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping her fingers in
annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door remains open for Petulia to
leave. May watches Petulia in amused tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What’s the next move, Petulia?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’d like to discuss your irresponsibility.
People are passing in the hallway, peering in.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Goodbye, Petulia. He advances on her,
somewhat threateningly.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: My rib. Archie slams the door shut ets a
bottle and a couple g of glasses, pointedly, exclu ding Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I should explain about Petuliaa She is a
kook. We are going to be married.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Archie, when you try to sound cool and
“with it,” you’re really pathetic. We’re trying to have an intelligent
conversation…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Well, about Polo, among other things.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Polo is none of your damned business.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: That’s dumb. Dumb. She’s my business and
she’s this lady’s business. I happen to hate Polo.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Needless to say she’s never even met
Polo.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I look at you and I know Polo. Explain that
to him. May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure how
to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be the exactly right
reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia is frightened by May.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: How many years were you married., Archie?
Eight? Ten? Anyhow, the best, Wasted. Gone down the drain.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Oh, come on ..o</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Archie, we are from two different worlds.
We’ve got nothing to agree on. Except one thing. You’re a lonely screwed
up mess. 0 Archie, I’m trying to save you. You’re a very special
man.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Tell him, May. Petulia doesn’t like May’s
amused reaction.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You don’t think so?</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: I won’t put Archie on a pedestal. He’ll do.</p>
<p>****: You’ve got yourself another winner, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: It’s a joke, you’re both putting me on.</p>
<p><strong>arc hie</strong>: Petulia. I mean it. Tubas. All this E “I
Love Lucy” jazz. It’s only cute for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: It’s not meant to be cute. I’m fighting for
your life.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Who’s trying to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: The two million, five hundred thousand
subscribers to the “Ladies Home Journal” … right, dear?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia, go home and save what’s his name. I
really don’t want to see you anymore. Archie’s voice is cold. Petulia is
suddenly defeated, mostly by May. She gets up and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Hi. Archie turns. Petulia is in the
medical library with books scattered all about her.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I think I’ve discovered a cure for
cancer.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Well, if you’re on the brink of something.
How did they let you in.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You look exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Do you know it’s almost three? Doesn’t
Mr. Danner worry at all about things like that? Petulia looks at him
reverently.</p>
<p>****: Look at you. Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight
line from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop him for a
moment. Then, without a word, they fall into step beside each other,
leaving the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>arc hie</strong>: Shall I drop you off? It’s too late for the
bus. She gets in.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia, you’ve got to stop following me
around like this. Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are
devouring him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding very
touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never seen before.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Where to? I could use a steak sandwich.
There’s a jazz joint that stays open all night. He reaches to start the
car just as she grabs at him, • awkwardly, aggressively.</p>
<p>****: Hey, come on ®m why this sudden Petulia is relentless and
voracious. Her hands and mouth are everywhere on Archie. A car is a
lousy bedroom but it will have to do. Heads bump against windows, elbows
jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be stopped. Finally,
Archie grips her shoulders and forces her to stop.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arc hie</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It m not really hungry.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Am I being punished?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Loganberry jam … we’ll have a case.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’d rather have a new plastic raincoat.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You don’t save anything on plastic
raincoats.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Shall I get another cart? Polo can fill
three or four when she really puts her mind to it. Petulia gets the
point and instantly takes her place</p>
<p><strong>woman shopper</strong>: You know what time it is? It’s after
fivB.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Ilia sorry.</p>
<p><strong>woman shopper</strong>: I want to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: So do we.</p>
<p><strong>42 tnt. archie’s bedroom night</strong>: Petulia is sound
asleep. Through the open bedroom door we see Archie drinking a lonesome
Coke.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Okay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow?
To satisfy myself, that’s who. Okay. He hangs up the phone and sees
Petulia looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Well, we knocked off another one. Another
notch in the old stethoscope.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You’re a wonderful doctor, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I keep a little black bow tie in my desk. In
0 case the services are in the morning and 1 have no time to go home.
The neekband’s all stained with sweat.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Why are you dressed?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Have to pick up the, kids, I’m already
late.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You’re not abandoning me? I mean, I wasn’t
all that bad, was I?</p>
<p><strong>arch ie</strong>: Amateur night, He leans over and kisses her
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Before I’ve brushed my teeth? Are you a
communist, Archie?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I guess so</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Tell Mike to watch that weight.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Will you be here when I get back?</p>
<p>****: Dumb, Archie. Dumb. Archie starts out, then stops,
troubled.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m divorcing David, if that’s what you
mean,</p>
<p>****: That’s none of my business. Petulia is suddenly hurt.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Phone me.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Listen, this worries me. Really.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Write the Number down so you won’t forget.
Archie grins, sighs, and starts out. Petulia will do anything to hold
him one second more.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Hey,, you. Archie turns at the door.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Don’t have any illusions about all those
groceries. I can’t cook.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: And you hate loganberry Jam.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: No, as a matter of fact, I rather like it.
He smiles, continues out.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: If somebody calls and wants medical advice
on something really obscure, is it okay if I wing it on my own? He makes
an amused “you nuts” gesture and leaves, but not before Petulia
says:</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Phone. He is gone.</p>
<p><strong>0 47 continued</strong>: Mike and Steven, Archie’s sons, are
anxiously waiting for their father to join them. Archie is in a phone
booth next to the ramp that leads to the boat. The boys are yelling to
Dad to come ono</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Hi, Shut up, you guys,</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Hi. What’s all the noise?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Mike.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Fat Mike?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: He’s not all that fat. During this series of
dumb, ordinary telephone conversa-</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I was dozing.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You left without having breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I had a cup of coffee on the way.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: A cup of coffee. You should have had eggs
or waffles.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>pause</strong>: PETULIA: I had a tall glass of pineapple
juice.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Make some toast, too. And milk. Breakfast is
a very important meal.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I wish you’d remember that.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Well, goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>0 petulia</strong>: Archie?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You won’t forget to phone.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: They used to think that escape from that
prison was impossible.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: They used to think that escape from that
prison was impossible.</p>
<p><strong>52b back to scene 52</strong>: We resume with Archie and the
boys.</p>
<p><strong>si</strong>: 52B Continued</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yes, Dad. Warren told us that last week.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Warren. Well, we could have gone somewhere
else. I didn’t know you had been.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: We thought maybe you had never been,
Dad.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No - well, thanks, actually I haven’t been
before, Stevie.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: In fact, we don’t call him Stevie anymore.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Mom thinks he’s getting a little old for being
called Stevie, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were
all calling you Stevie two weeks ago – I was.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Before that.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Warren says that Alcatraz taught the world you
can get out of anything if you want to bad enough.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That’s what Warren said, eh?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yes, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>53 another view of the boat</strong>: The boys are watching
Archie who is in that section of the boat where the radar and electronic
equipment are kept. Archie is on the ship telephone. He is trying to
keep a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia, it is
difficult.</p>
<p><strong>• mike :</strong>: Doctors can do things like that. Call
their patients from wherever they are. Archie finishes the call and
returns to them, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: How about clams on the wharf when we get
back?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Clams make Steve vomit.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You forgot that.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No, it just slipped my mind. Archie really
does like his kids but his thoughts are somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: • Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>55 continued</strong>: Most of all Petulia is doing something
of absolutely no importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car
the moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two kooks having a
few seconds of horsing around. The joke is on both of them – the guard,
harassed by the honking of thousands of cars and having fully inspected
the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the convertible on through. Petulia
stops the car a few hundred yards past the border to let Oliver climb
out, but he just sits there. Petulia thinks, “okay, you little bastard
.” and zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first moment the
look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver’s tough little face. During
this we hear Archie and Petulia’s second tele- phone conversation which
is as blab and loving as before.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Hi, there.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m having lunch with the boys.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You eat a good lunch, Archie,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I will, I will.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You only had a cup of coffee for
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’ll eat a good lunch, Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia, they have a thousand different
things on the menu.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You should have a sirloin steak with french
fries or baked beans.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: That’s easy to say, Archie, But I know
you.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Steak with french fries or baked beans.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Do they have fresh sea-food?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Sea bass is nice.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes, sea bass is great.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: If they grill it,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’ll have grilled sea bass.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Unless they do a nice omelet.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m sure they would if I asked.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: It’s such a problem.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Phone.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Warren take you here?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: He would see the sign, eh? See</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Hey, this is great. Archie chases them
through the floors. Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which
says that this phone is for the military and is to be used only in
emergency. Archie approaches it warily, then loses his nerve and turns
back to his kids. Archie wants to get back to Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Alright? The boys look at him
uncertainly.</p>
<p>****: Its ten to two. Can you imagine that? The time really went The
boys know that means he wants to take them home.</p>
<p>****: I’m really bushed.</p>
<p>****: I feel okay. Stevie is willing to let his dad off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I been sneezing.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: So I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: He’s always sneezing.</p>
<p><strong>arc hie</strong>: Hey, next week I want you guys over for the
entire weekend. None of this three or four hour stuff.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: All weekend?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You ’gust wait! Stevie is instantly
excited,</p>
<p><strong>• stevie</strong>: Something really interesting?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Bet your life’.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Just leave it to melt</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Warren said something about the Roller
Derby.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Friday night till late Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Unless you guys don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: The Roller Derby’s pretty darn
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’d have to sleep over. I mean if we were
going to spend the whole weekend.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I want you to.</p>
<p>****: Well, it’s fine by me.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Me toot Boy l</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Okay, it’s a dealt Mike turns away.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: He’s going to cry I guess – he does
that.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: A nice, neat kid. After all the exuberance
he feels so empty. Everywhere things are scattered about.</p>
<p><strong>61 continued</strong>: Th�-, phone is off the hook. Archie
doesn’t know where to turn first. He feels Petulia’s throat for a pulse,
isn’t sure she has one, Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from
Se. 23. Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up from
the broken rib that this is impossible. Archie presses his mouth over
Petulia’s to attempt to get her breathing again. He tries this only for
an instant then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an emergency
number. Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse in her
throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling. As always when a crisis
really happens, it isn’t as easy as the Red Cross advertisements say.
Her mouth won’t open right. His mouth seems unable to make the
connection with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making than a
life-saving procedure.</p>
<p><strong>dog’s owner</strong>: Don’t you hit Lennie! Archie is too
distressed about Petulia to even respond. At every door there is a
tenant. A jumble of voices all spoken together.</p>
<p><strong>1st tenant</strong>: 0 That’s sex for you.</p>
<p><strong>2nd tenant</strong>: It could be a gas leak.</p>
<p><strong>0 3rd tenant</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>4th tenant</strong>: Those rescue cops never give up.</p>
<p><strong>5th tenant</strong>: Yes’. but they’re all racists. Of
course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other a Negro. All
through this we have also been aware of many T.V. sets, all with
programs with various kinds of violence. One youbgster comes to the door
holding a portable T.V. and we see on the tube war casualties being
flown out of the Jungle by helicopters. Archie has crossed ahead of the
special officers to lead the way down the steps. Half a dozen “hippies”’
loaded down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up the
steps. Everything is chaos. The officers just can’t manage the stretcher
down the narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every which
way - all in the name of saving her life.</p>
<p><strong>63 continued</strong>: David takes a sip of coffee. Oliver
grabs at the orange juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat
but saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to make bubbles.
David looks at Oliver and then at Petulia, all through the bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Say hello to “Petulia”s Folly.” David says
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>pet ulia</strong>: If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd,
feast your eyes on this little goodie.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What°s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Why can’t you speak English? Why the hell
don’t they teach them English? This little hustler picked me up in
Tijuana –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ve got a name for him! Oliver doesn’t
understand what is being said, but he is getting uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>o liver</strong>: Lady say “hey come on us go San Francisco
ten bucks.”</p>
<p><strong>pet ul ia</strong>: You bleeding little liar! Oliver looks at
Petulia innocently.</p>
<p>****: I never did! She’s worried about David.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: What I said to this malicious little fink
was that maybe one day if we went back to Tijuana –</p>
<p><strong>davit?</strong>: San Francisco?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: San Francisco. Each says it in his own
accent, and so begins a word game.</p>
<p>****: San Francisco.</p>
<p>****: San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay. “San Francisco.” 0 He pronounces it
like Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: David doesn’t answer her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s your name? What are you called?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oliver. They begin laughing again. Petulia
is becoming t. completely unnerved.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: David. The San Diego bus is due at twelve
fifteen. I’ve already bought him a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ve got to get this on tape. He’s really
something else’. I get a real kick out of him! “San Francisco.” Unless
he’s a midget. Hey, sure! Oliver is a sixty-three-year-old midgets
Oliver grins, not understanding but feeling he has an ally.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Get in. It’s still a long drive. We’ll never
get home.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Okay. He can wait inside. The cashier’s a
sweet old dear. I’ll have him keep an eye on the ckeeky little bugger! 0
She opens the car door to take Oliver out, tense, wanting to get past
this moment but fearful that she won’t.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You promised “Oliver” “San Francisco.”</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I did not.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Like hell you didn’t’. David abruptly hops
over the seat and sits behind the wheel. He signals for Petulia to get
in beside Oliver. Petulia hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I dig, bitch, I dig! She’s stunned. His hand
reaches out and brutally jerks her into the car.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I dig. CAMERA HOLDS on Petulia’s frightened
face. Now suddenly 0 the face has a tube in the nose; there’s another
tube in her throat; and she’s unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>barney’s voice</strong>: Hey you. Barney is looking over the
shower door at Archie with a mixture of concern and anger.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: 0 Did you know there’s a policeman outside
wanting to talk to you? Archie nods dully.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: What the hell is going on? Archie nods
dully.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Can you have dinner with us tonight? Archie
nods dully.</p>
<p><strong>barns y</strong>: You like this new lens, Archie? Is this the
greatest lens you ever saw?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Mrnmmmm?</p>
<p>****: What am I supposed to do – spend the money on belly dancers?i
Wilma enters from another room. She’s exhausted,</p>
<p><strong>.wi lma</strong>: Ask me what your daughter put in her steam
inhalator,</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I don’t want to know,</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Ask.me, Cottage cheese,</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Actually I’m relieved,</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I’m afraid she’s madly in love with your
Stevie,</p>
<p>****: Steven. Wilma looks at the pictures on the wall,</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Wasn’t that a gorgeous week! I just adore Big
Sur!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: It rained every day. You kept insisting you
were pregnant,</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: You must take Polo and the boys – She stops
embarrassed,</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Wilma-The-Magic-Talking-Machine. Put a dime
in and she talks all night.</p>
<p><strong>0 wilma</strong>: I’m sorry Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I just can’t think of you without thinking of
Polo. Archie nods.</p>
<p>****: Had to drive Made me run a frog test on her. forty miles in the
rain. Almost hit a truck. Could have been dead and buried three years.
Through this Barney keeps changing slides. Suddenly there is a picture
of Archie, Polo and Wilma on another vacation. In this slide they are
posing in corny T-shirts. The T-shirts say, “Kiss me you fool” and “I
love the Rolling Stones”., etc.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I’ll bet he’s sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with a little
old-fashioned nostalgia.</p>
<p><strong>wi lma</strong>: Do you remember that crazy Labour Day
weekend we drove to Tahoe?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I’ve got them right her Archie frowns at
Wilma and Barney. But they are clumsy and obvious, and he is somewhat
touched.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I keep everything. They just happen to be
here. What do you think this is, a conspiracy?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes, Really they are all good friends, and
they laugh good- naturedly,</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Let’s see them Archie. Barney starts showing
different slides of the Tahoe vacation. Archie watches scratching his
ear, and eating peanuts. Wilma looks like the tears are about to start,
C.S. A child cries “Mommy!”</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: You go this time. Barney goes, leaving the
slide still showing on the wall. Wilma looks at Archie for a long
moment.</p>
<p>****: • Wilma what do you want me to say? They were great old
times,</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Archie what’s happening to you?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Dontt say nothing – the policeman even called
here!</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Itm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I’ve had a splitting earache all day. Friends
have certain rights, even the right to be obnoxious. Do you love this
woman? Archie shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: i Well you must feel something.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah I guess so. Pity.</p>
<p><strong>0 w i lma</strong>: Pity. Go to the dog pound. You’ll find
two hundred dogs ready to be gassed. Policemen. Then Wilma sighs.</p>
<p><strong>wi lma</strong>: Shall I tell you something? I wish I had
your guts.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Who would do such a thing to a girl like this?
She’s a child. Is there an orthopaedic problem, Dr. Bollen?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: A. doctor should get his sleep.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You left the needle in. The nun would like
to scream at Archie about the impropriety of his presence here but she
can’t. She is proud of the bottle of blood.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: From the Archbishop’s Fund.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Take the needle out.</p>
<p><strong>0 nun</strong>: All races and creeds. Why hasn’t her husband
been notified?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I suppose they’ve tried.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: It would be such a nice surprise to have his
picture here when she finally awakens. Wouldn’t that be nice?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes,</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: It would give her some small comfort,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I would put a bit more tape around the
needle,</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I mentioned her this morning in the chapel. I
mention all my criticals.</p>
<p><strong>• archie</strong>: In the future be more careful of the
needle.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: She hardly makes a bump under the sheets. She
leaves. Archie moves closer to Petulia examining her throat and eyes for
vital signs. He pushes open an eyelid and Petulia’s dead eye stares
glassily into his living face.</p>
<p><strong>oliver’s attendant</strong>: Come on, come on, get on with
it.</p>
<p><strong>just before dawn</strong>: Three weeks ago. Oliver is wide
awake, wolfing down a loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner
kitchen. As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct sounds from
the master bedroom. moans and groans, a sudden cry, all of which he
supposes are the sounds of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark.
Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the hall. She has
hastily put on a pair of slacks and a blouse, and is struggling into a
coat. Her hair is tousled, her face filled with anguish.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey, “San Francisco”! He pronounces it like
Oliver does. He comes down the steps, three at a time. He stops before
the kid.</p>
<p>****: I sure hope there’s no hard feelings. Oliver understands none
of this, and of course David knows this, but it doesn’t stop him.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It isn’t a question of hospitality, I want
you to understand that. I feel terrible. Dragging you all the way up to
San Francisco and then not even showing you Fisherman’s Wharf.
Comprehend.? Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys to the
car.</p>
<p><strong>da vid</strong>: 0 Hold it a minute!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s the rushy Whereas the fire! He stoops
down beside the boy and shows him a wrist watch.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’ve go to have some little memento.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>petul ia</strong>: David, for God’s sakes The wrist watch is
much too big for Oliver’s skinny wrist so David starts to fasten it
around Oliver’s biceps. Even this is too skinny so David starts
fastening it around Oliver’s lower leg. Oliver has no idea what is
happening, but his hustler’s heart tells him he is being given something
very valuable. Petulia is repelled.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You see the basic problem is we just don’t
have the room for all the folks my old lady invites for a visit. Were
kinda short of room. I’d give you the shirt off my back. I’m West-Texas
and proud of it. But start loading up the house with make-believe kids,
plus every Tom, Dick and Harry whose one and only claim to fame is that
he knows how to do “it” –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hands off! The watch won’t fasten to the leg
either. David tries to fit it around the boy’s neck. David begins to
cry.</p>
<p><strong>da v1’d</strong>: It won’t fit any place. Petulia somehow
gets Oliver into the lift and pushes the button. which starts it moving
upward.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t want any hard feelings’ It was
nothing personals Hey, we’ll look you up sometime; When we’re down that
way., Have a real old-fashioned fiesta; We’ll have a ball; “Oliver?”
During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver, Oliver,
infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he has David’s watch in
his fist.</p>
<p><strong>ol i ver</strong>: He give me! Petulia stares out toward the
sea. Davis is still screaming atl.them, and his voice sounds so unlikely
in all the splendor of morning coming to San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>73 int, hospital’s underground garage day</strong>: Archie is
maneuvering his car out of his parking space when he sees the nun of the
Intense Care Unit cross to another car driven by another nuns There are
many cars with many nuns zooming around,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: How’s your patient?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Danner.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Mrs. Danner. How’s Mrs. Danner?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: She woke up awhile ago.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: She woke up?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Should .I have called you`d</p>
<p><strong>?n</strong>: She’s asleep now. I’m, to buy her blue
Cornflowers and a hairbrush. Sister Teresa phoned the police. Prayers
help, Dr. Bollena She asked for Mr. Danner. I hope there’s no orthopedic
problem. But really she’s not all that bad, this nun, mostly she
believes that the sanctity of marriage happens to be true. She is not
unmoved by the look of exhaustion on Archie’s face.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Blue Cornflowers. They exchange a smile.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I’m’also to go all the way across town and
deliver a message to the Mendoza family, I’m to tell them everything is
okay. And give them this.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Let me.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Mr. Mendoza? Mendoza yawns sleepily.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m Dr. Bollen. Do you know Mrs. Danner?
Petulia Danner?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia Danner. She gave me this address,
The Mexican shakes his head in complete indifference, is already
thinking about going back to sleep, and starts closing the door,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: She was beaten. Almost to death. Are you
Mr. Mendoza?</p>
<p><strong>mexican</strong>: “Mendoza,” si,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: This is for you,</p>
<p><strong>mexican</strong>: Gracia. He starts to open the envelope. It
contains a twenty dollar bill,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Can I talk to you for a minute? Mendoza,
with no idea what Archie is saying, starts closing the door and
pocketing the money.</p>
<p><strong>heyp</strong>: He pounds on the door. The door opens. The
Mexican says in</p>
<p><strong>mexican</strong>: I work all night. Go away. He closes the
door. Archie pounds on the door again. He hurts his hand. He sucks on
the slight wound. He kicks at the door. He crosses around to the front
of the house, A negro and a white teenager are passing.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Do either of you fellows speak Spanish? a
NEGRO TEENAGER I speak a lot of Polish, if it would be any help,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’ve got to talk with this man in here. A
woman was almost beaten to death.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: You said here,</p>
<p><strong>negro</strong>: Almost, but not quite to death, sir?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Here but not quite here?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Listen, just find a cop, huh;</p>
<p><strong>• negro teenager</strong>: He’d better speak Polish, sir. I’m
on a fantastic Polish kick. The two chase each other down the street
yelling “Da:” and “Paderewskii” and even “Yawohl;”, etc, Archie looks at
the house and then at his car and then at his bruised hand. He’s
furious„ A police car passes’. Archie looks, but somehow can’t bring
himself to hail it. He wonders why he let the police car pass. He goes
back to his car,</p>
<p><strong>75 into intensive care unit day</strong>: Archie moves
swiftly to the screened cubicle that held Petulia. He goes inside. He
stops short. An old man lies in the bed with a rubber stop in his mouth
to keep him from swallowing his tongue until he regains consciousness.
His false teeth lie on the table beside him. Archie is plunged deeper
into the sense of the unreal.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: In the next bed is a middle-aged lady looking at
T.V. Petulia sees Archie.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Why weren’t you there when I woke up? You
better not say you were when the bill comes, Dr. Bollen.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Who is this guy, Mendoza? Why am I always
finding you in a different bed? What are you?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Avery sick girl.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Who beat you up?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Nothing happened to my hand.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I love your hands. I want plaster of paris
molds for bookcases. Bookends.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Did David beat you up? Was it Mendoza? Why
did you send him money?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m still very sick.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>other patient</strong>: This man is a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: The world’s best, madame The patient turns
her back on the two of them.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia,you’re turning me into a nut. Why
hasn’t David been here?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Ask me questions.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia, is it possible for you to tell the
truth about anything?</p>
<p>****: so Mendoza was looking after Oliver for nae She” s our cleaning
lady s</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: There was no Mrs o Mendoza Z</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I had to have some place for him to stay,,
David would never have let e bring him home</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Bring who home?</p>
<p><strong>pett lia</strong>: Iqm beginning to hurt.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petuliag I don’t understand the kind of
world you live ina Come on. For Ghri.st$s sake, a pretty young gi.rl9
what the hell is going on, who would lay a hand on you, how could you
get so screwed up? Through this Petulia simply lies there, just looking
a Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I cans t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Irm asleep. They gave me a pill.and I’
asleep,, Really0 I am really very sleepy,, Can we talk later, Archie?
When ivm asleep kiss my forehead. She closes her eyes and sleeps. Archie
gives her fore- head a kiss and she giggles. He leaves.</p>
<p><strong>77 into archiebs apartment night.</strong>: Furniture Is
pushed back and three pup tents circle the center of the room. Archie
and his sons have been having a camp-in. They are all dressed in jeans
and sweat shirts and Stevie even wears moccasins - as though they were
in the:High Sierras. The remainders of T.V. dinners are scattered around
plus. Coke bottles plus their bed rolls from last night. Actually though
it :rust: have sounded. like a great idea the two bogs are very bored,
Archie,,: though trying to be “with-it’ is far away,, and they sense
it.</p>
<p><strong>stevie.</strong>: Shouldn’t we police the area?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Good idea. Police the area.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: This is keen, Dad. Water canteens and
everything.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I’m out of water.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Always make sure you’ve got water. You’ll
find some in the kitchen. What’s on T.V.?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I’’m hot. In fact.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Switch the fire off then. Stevie goes to
switch the electric fireplace off.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s really keen, Dad. The bell rings and Polo
is standing there, She looks around, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: I’ don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Even canteens, Mom. 0 Polo really only has
eyes for Archie. She is troubled by how haggard and worn he looks.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Roller Derby starts at eight.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: We have to police the area.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s really been keen, Mom. Nobody ever heard
of a. camp-in. The two boys now busy themselves with straightening out
the place as Polo crosses to-Archie,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It’s been really keen, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Poor Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Not “dumb” Archie?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Never. The brightest. I used to have such
terrible anxiety that I would die suddenly. Before I could say thank
you, Archie is very touched.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I have to go to. the latrine. Stevie
goes.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Is Dad allowed to come to the Roller Derby? I
mean since Uncle Warren couldn’t? He is so bad at matchmaking that Polo
and Archie can hardly keep a straight face.</p>
<p>****: Don’t let’that old fat butt get awa with tat;</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Will you please tell.your son –</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>m ike</strong>: They don’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I want some popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’ll get it. He rises quickly and moves to
the refreshment counter behind the grandstand. Archie finds a telephone
booth. Polo watches him at the • phone booth. Her eyes lose their
warmth. The women’s team races around the track. Archie returns with a
box of Cracker Jacks.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I said popcorn.</p>
<p>****: How is she? Dead I hope? Archie is stunned at Polo’s abrupt
coldness.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You don’t even know her.</p>
<p>****: I just have to look at you. ,Archie stops, remembering this is
approximately what Petulia had said about Polo. He does a “how odd:”
without saying it.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: She’s not going to die.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: What a shame.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: She has her first visitor. Mr. Danner. Polo
couldn’t care less. Five skaters smash into each other on the rink but
Polo doesn’t flinch. She wouldn’t think of turning to Archie for
comfort.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: “His Mastahs in’Hydraul:ics.” They sit
coldly wit4 their children, a million miles apart.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: It’s been a terrible shock to us… to
Mother and me,..Our sailor boy and his pretty bride.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner’s voice</strong>: As I told Mother, “the values we
lived by just don’t seem to mean anything at all anymore. Our kids can
chuck out two thousand years of Western civilization ..of
Christianity…as though it wasn’t worth a red cent.’</p>
<p>****: I must say Mother’s answer surprised and, well, really sort of
tickled me: “It’s easy to be an angel when you’re old and worn out and
nobody wants you anymore,” You see we do try, Petulia. I mean there you
were in that man’s apartment. Where I come from …in “little pockets of
ignorance” I suppose you’d call it…you’ll find people who still live by
the unwritten law.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: There’s still many a county courthouse
where the husband could kill both parties and not spend one night in
jail, O.S. We hear SOUNDS of a bell ringing incessantly in short
bursts.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: In the hospital of my dreams people
won’t be chased out like sheep. People are better than most of the
medicines they give you. David has finally’got around to repairing that
wharf. He hired a couple of boys. The three of them are really working
up a sweat. He’s thinking of sailing all the way down the coast to Lima.
That’s in Peru. All through this there’s no response whatever from
Petulia. Her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: They say Lima is a terrific city. If you
watch out for flies and take sensible sanitary precautions. I’ll tell
you a secret but don’t you snitch: I’m using propaganda on David so that
the four of 0 us can go. Mother’s a better sailor than I am. Even though
I served eighteen months on a mine sweeper. Which should have prepared
me for anything.</p>
<p>****: Visiting hours are over.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: I had lunch with your Mr. Pearl less
than two weeks ago; The nun looks blank.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: Mr. Pearl happens to be the
superintendent of this Hospital; Two weeks ago at the Blue Fox
Restaurants Just the six of usl The nun shrugs and leaves. Mr. Danner is
really trembling now from his controlled emotion. Petulia will not take
her eyes from the giraffe. The patient in the next bed is grumbling
something about “what’s sauce for the goose should be’ sauce for the
gander”, etc. Mr. Danner abruptly takes a • small leather bound
photograph from his pocket. It’s the wedding picture of Petulia and
David. Without a word he puts it on the night stand. Petulia will not
look at it.</p>
<p><strong>mr.. danner’s voice</strong>: David and I went at it hot and
heavy. About the value of psychiatry. I mean sensible psychiatry. None
of that “Sex- is-the-reason-for-everything” junk. It E won’t ever
replace a visit to the wood- shed and a good whack across the backside,
but its late in the old ball game for that.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I’m sorry Sir, but it’s time for the lady’s
medication.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: Does anyone ever report how filthy this
room is? He loses all his aplomb, He squats, he points, he finds
imaginary objects on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>mr, danner</strong>: Look at this’. Look at this! I
personally raised fifty thousand dollars for this Hospital during the
last campaign. You didn’t know that did you; Well ask Mr, Pearl’. I mean
if you knew what he looked like’. Filthy’. He gets up to go, The nun
leaves, Mr. Danner brushes imaginary dust from his knees. He’s
perspiring, dis- hevelled, and still hasn°t said what he came to say. He
waits there a moment more, Finally in a flat voice</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Tell David, it’s alright. He can come out
of the cupboard. The old man almost sobs. Instead he exclaims in a jolly
voice.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: Chin up’.</p>
<p><strong>81a roller derby</strong>: This time we are with the T.V.
CAMERAMAN, and we are looking through his scanner. We see all the
excited people, but among them sit Archie and Polo, as cold as death.
Suddenly, on the scanner, we see Polo rise and begin to leave tugging
the two boys along with her, Archie makes no move to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I’m not sick! Don’t waste time on me!
Archie turns to face the nun in attendance.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Mrs. Danner? They picked her up.
Dr. Worthington said it was alright so long as she had proper
nursing.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Who picked her up.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Her husband I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: They had a long talk with Dr. Worthington. He
seemed entirely satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: They kidnapped hero He hurries down the
hall. The’nun is startled.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Take care of the sick people! I’m in
tip-top shape!</p>
<p><strong>is</strong>: special hospital bed. There are flowers
everywhere. She has her own colour T.V. set which is silently showing
scenes of violence. An efficient nurse is in attendance.</p>
<p><strong>85 continued</strong>: 0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of
the bed, and Petulia is brushing the nurse’s hair. Archie stands in the
doorway overwhelmed at the normality of it all. Obviously Petulia has
fixed her hair too.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Hi Archie. Dazedly Archie crosses to the
night stand where there is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has
nothing else to do he sniffs the tomato juice,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital. He’s a
splendid doctor, This is Agnes Lillywhite.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Our young lady is doing nicely. We have a few
problems, but nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: • I get hiccups.` I go along merrily
hiccupping for hours on end.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Why did you leave the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I was feeling ever so much better, Archie.
Mrs. Danner looks in. She is wearing an apron and stirring a batch of
something.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. danner</strong>: Will you be staying for lunch, sir?
Goodness knows there’s plenty of meatloaf. She goes and David enters. He
looks extremely handsome. He wears white duck pants and a slip-over
sweater. And a happy-go-lucky grin.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You two haven’t met. This is
Dr. Bollen.</p>
<p>****: Yes, I thought so. Hello, there! David sees that Archie has no
intention of shaking his hand, so he crosses to the bed and begins to
playfully Drank Petulia up and down.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I want you to go back to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Dr. Worthington says she’s doing fine. He’s
going to make daily house calls.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: He’s very good about that.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Petulia _m® ! During this Mr. Danner has
entered. He is really the only one not good at the charade.</p>
<p>****: Well, you’re finally meeting our whole family.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: Dr. Bollen, I wouldn’t exactly call this
good taste. Not to mention medical ethics.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Dad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen.
Archie suspects he is having a nightmare. With the exception of
Mr. Danner, he has never seen so many cheerful people in one place.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You told the policeman you had a dizzy
spell.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Right. I fell on my bottom.</p>
<p><strong>0 archie</strong>: You were beaten up. You were somebody’s
punching bag.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: won’t have you cross-examining this
girl.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Your son nearly killed this girl.</p>
<p>****: Hey now listen, doe, I’ll stand still for only so much.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danner</strong>: I want you to remember what this man
just said. Though it’s none of your business, my boy was in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. Looking at boats.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: We’ve decided we’re quite happy with the
one we have.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: When Dad phoned me I was having dinner with a
cousin of ours. Real mouth- watering Creole cooking. He and Petulia
chuckle at each other as though this were some kind of private joke.
Archie crosses to Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He
doesn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>****: I’m fine Archie. Except I burp a lot. Everybody gets dizzy
spells. Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed brushing
the nurse’s hair; to David; to Mr. Danner who’s obviously annoyed at
Archie’s bad taste; to Mrs. Danner who is in the dining room setting up
an extra place for Archie. What can he do? Abruptly he rushes from the
house.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Going back to the house was the
only thing I could do. scenes 87A B D .,and E occur only in Petulia’s
mind.</p>
<p>****: Where else could I go? A lonely hotel room? I don’t have a
penny of my own. Mr. Danner promised me I’d never be left alone. I
thought I’d try it for a few days. Don’t be-angry. It was nobody’s
fault. Actually, if anyone is to blame, it’s you, Archie.</p>
<p>****: Me?I.o</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’m Petulia Danner . save me like you saved
Oliver … save me from David! Don’t lust scramble up the hill like a • b
oody fool o</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m looking for the ticket for my
raincoat.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Coming for me in that pokey little
car.</p>
<p>****: 9 Why didn’t you bring a proper ambulance? As though you really
meant it.</p>
<p><strong>archie’s voice</strong>: I didn’t know what to do. I was
going from one moment to the next.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: Spectacular entrance, lousy exit.
Sounds familiar, Archie. Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice:</strong>: No, it’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>87e the golden gate bridge day</strong>: Petulia dismisses
the ambulance from her mind because she has something very serious to
say to Archie. She is with him on the rocks below the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I went back to the house because I owed it
to David. I have a brown thumb when it comes to men. I put them on the
Cross and call them Jesus. And there they hang. I don’t know why I do
it. Not because of any high opinion of myself… oh, Archie, if you only
knew…</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Look at him. Isn’t he super. A six foot
three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did that. I’d ruin you, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: David was the gentlest man I ever
knew.</p>
<p><strong>petulia’s voice</strong>: I’d ruin you. In five weeks, I’d be
running around with a black eye. By now, Archie has reached the top of
the cliff and is a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the
Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist maniacally.</p>
<p><strong>89 ext0 muir woods day</strong>: During the following
SEQUENCE OF SCENES Archie is trying to get back to normality. He’s
having a nice sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo’s fiance. It is a
pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are being told about the
forest by an Irish guide. In the background Archie’s two children are
playing with Warren’s child.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: It’s never too soon to think of the boys’
education. Warren winks at him knowingly.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Have you thought of doing something about
that?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: ; ; ^ ^ ���,, That twi Lch v v d.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What twitch? I don’t have a twitch.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You do. Come and see me. Don’t touch it,
it’ll give you a phobia. I’ll fix it for free.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Thanks, I will. You know, I like you more t
han I ever thought I would.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Warren, you’re a beautiful human being. They
turn to watch the boys at play. Nearby, the guide is explaining
something to the Indians.</p>
<p><strong>indian child</strong>: What happens next?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Spring. Archie smiles hoeefully.</p>
<p><strong>90 into a marvelous restaurant night</strong>: Beyond is the
entire shockingly beautiful panorama of San Francisco. Archie and May
are having champagne cocktails. They clink glasses and look at each
other through candlelight. Archie spills some of his cock- tail but May
doesn’t spill a drop. Archie smiles hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>91 into discotheque night</strong>: Archie dances with many
girls, some hippies, some chic, all terribly young and unsmiling. Archie
smiles hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>ar c hie</strong>: You look better.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Feel marvelous. Michael and Stevie? Archie
nods,</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: We?-re going to see the penguins. Everything
okay with your</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Oh yes, fine. The cars start down their
separate ways.</p>
<p><strong>0 93 continued</strong>: Now the taped music is blaring a
Loud marching song as the penguins lumberingly form into a Roman legion,
The laughter,, music and applause ?make any intimate conversa- tion
almost impossible. But Petulia is waiting for Archie to say something.
Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to stare at his
father accusingly. Mike won’t stop staring. Mike now tries to make
Stevie turn and look accusingly with him, Archie doesn’t know what to
do0 Finally, Petulia rises and gathers her parcels,, still quite
pleasant. She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves it for hero Its from a
sportswear shop,, colorful and gay. As Archie gives Petulia the parcel,
she touches his hand, running her fingers lightly over his skin,
thoughtful, as though wanting to remember something. Petulia moves
quickly through people toward the exit. Archie almost calls her back,
but there is too much noise.</p>
<p><strong>first gentleman</strong>: Oh, oho We were supposed to be out
of here before you came home, Dr. Bollen. So you’d think it came from
Santa Claus, The two elderly gentlemen chuckle at Archie’s puzzled
look.</p>
<p><strong>first gentleman</strong>: Wonderful. i.sn g t - t ? They sell
like hot cakes. Gives you something alive in all this stone.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: There must be some mistake. He sags down on
a chair, draped in his research books. The two old gentlemen couldn’t be
more pleased.</p>
<p><strong>first gentleman</strong>: Mac and I get a, big kick out of
people’s first reaction. Its not a toy. It’s a working greenhouse. You
control heat and humidity with these. You’ve got a little bit of
everything. Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters. Even a little vegetable
garden. The most important thing to remember is to keep the sun out.
These new kind of lights work so much better, there’s no comparison.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You’ve got the wrong apartment l</p>
<p>****: No we have not s Dr. Bollen3</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What screwball …?I Then he stops, He knows
what screwball.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No gift card?</p>
<p><strong>first gentleman</strong>: It might come by mail. Archie
starts chuckling. He crosses to the green- house, still chuckling.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: This one heat, and this one humidity,
right?</p>
<p><strong>first gentleman</strong>: Exactly. We’ve left a manual of
operations, and wetll check everything out in a month. Okay,
Dr. Bollen?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Okay, okay! Goodbye,’ He enters the
greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as the two old gentlemen exit
from the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Did you get mama on the plane all
right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure. But what a dinky plane. Poor mamats
stomach problems are far from over. He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up
after a moment, looks about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers
into one of the windows that looks down into the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You didn’t leave papa alone in that
horrible little town?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s not such a horrible little town. Hearts
of artichokes’</p>
<p>****: David…</p>
<p><strong>david?</strong>: Take your “Vitamer Zed,” you blinkint
Limey.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Papa went with her at the last minute.
Petulia REACTS, shocked.</p>
<p>****: She was so pale and seared. They aren’t even pressurized. The
plane. You suck on a tube and hope it’s oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: During this he has peeled the orange and torn it
into segments, which he now tries to feed her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Open.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: How could he have gone? Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where mama is concerned, papa is a very
loving man. Open. Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She
seems about to leave the yacht.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: He Dromised;</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Honey. It’ll be okay, Cross my heart.</p>
<p><strong>0 petulta</strong>: He promised.</p>
<p><strong>w oman</strong>: Hello there you gorgeous people. Everyone’s
invited for Margueritas and cha-cha-cha.</p>
<p>****: Mr. and Mrs. Danner are gone,</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oooh la la; Lucky you; The group goes off,
toward their yacht. Petulia doesn’t know what to do. David skims off his
jeans and jackknifes into the water. The sun glints on his exquisite
body. Confusedly, Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth.
David surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: We didn’t have to come back this
early..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re still not one hundred per cent well.
They’ve reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside. Suddenly his
hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and in a gesture he hopes
is playful, he pulls her down the steps into the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Icy hands.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Warm heart.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So they say, Petulia says nothing. She begins
undressing,</p>
<p>****: I didn’t tell papa to leave. She doesn’t answer.</p>
<p>****: He only had the clothes on his back. She doesn’t answer.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t.want him to leave.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: All right, David.</p>
<p><strong>• david</strong>: “All right, David,” through chattering
teeth. Petulia crawls under the sheet of a bunk.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Only a crazy man hits a woman. Or a coward. T
won’t ever again. I’d stick my hand into a garbage disposal. I would,
Petulia. I’d grind it up, Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid,
David abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare pistol.
He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia. She sits up in panic.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hang on to it. If I come for you let me have
a flare. Between the eyes. I’ll melt in ten seconds. Petulia is
touched.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Girls are beautiful,</p>
<p>****: So are centaurs, unicorns, minataurs,0.</p>
<p>****: , ,astron.uts, short order cooks, trumpet players,,,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Cavalry officers, aging poets, men of
science,,. They are enjoying the nonsense. Then on “Men of Science’:</p>
<p><strong>0 97f david’s image:</strong>: His finger is pressed against
the doorbell over which is the nameplate “DR, A. BOLEN.” The door
finally opens and Petulia is standing there in Archie’s hooded
sweatshirt. Her eyes widen in terror as David enters Archie’s apartment.
She knows he has come here to kill her, 97G The image ends. David is
abruptly withdrawn, but Petulia is carried away by memory.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: The first time I saw you, you were being
charming to- somebody who didn’t buy a boat after all, You were wearing
a light blue turtleneck sweater. Your sunglasses w®re’pushed up into
your hair. You had sandals, but’-no socks. Trying. to sell a forty foot
yacht without socks. I had never seen anything so perfect. “He’s not
real. He’s one of those plastic gadgets Americans do so well. Ah, but I
want one.”</p>

<p><strong>98 continued</strong>: Then Petulia sees Archie beside her
bed. He is wearing his hospital jacket which gives him the run of the
place.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: They can’t keep any secrets around
here.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: When did you get back?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: A year ago. You didn’t forget me,</p>
<p><strong>arch ie</strong>: How could I? All those laughs. He dabs a
Kleenex on her sweat-beaded face.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: So, Things go better with Mr. and
Mrs. Danner,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Obviously, They look at each other
tenderly.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Why did you let me get away?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Bad timing. Dumb Archie.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Girls like me are very rare, Archie Archie
cannot endure this,</p>
<p>****: I could.call an ambulance. Take you to a private hospital in
Oakland. If we didn’t make it in time, so what, I don’t know how many
babies I delivered as an intern.</p>
<p><strong>40 archie</strong>: There’s nothing to it. Especially a girl
with your pelvis, You’ve got a very superior pelvis.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: We’d never be apart again0</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You don’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I do. Petulia twists in pain. The nurse
looks over.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: That wasn’t four minutes. The nurse makes a
note then turns her attention to another lady who must be wheeled to the
Delivery Room,</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I hurt. Touch it Archie. Make it hurt less.
His hand touches her belly very gently.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: 0 It doesn’t help.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: But your hands were magic with Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Who? Her pain has subsided, and she looks up
at Archie.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Would you really?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: You’d call an ambulance? At this late
stage?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Say the word.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: No. I’m different now. Damn it Archie, why
did I go to that Motel with you?</p>
<p>****: Do you realize we were actually only a one night stand? We
never even gave each other a cold, All we really did was pass each other
going the other way. Have I changed you, Archie?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You turned me into a nut.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Is that good?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yes, I think so, Who knows? I hope</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Archie, call the ambulance. Archie crosses
to the phone, picks up the receiver, then almost at once he puts it down
again.</p>
<p><strong>• petulia</strong>: When I lay dying – twenty years from now
– a middle-aged old lady – wondering what my life was all about, you
won’t even cross my mind. Archie winces. He starts out. He cantt even
say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Hey, wait I lied.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: I’ll never forget you, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Arnold? He starts laughing, then she starts
laughing. He crosses to her and holds her hand in his very tightly. Then
he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Archie feels unexpectedly giddy and carefree. He
meets David carrying a silly, sweet gift. David tenses for a show-down,
Archie impulsively flips out David’s tie and continues on his way,</p>
<p><strong>100 ext0 hospital day</strong>: As Archie exits from the
hospital a kid on a roller board almost kills him. He has an ice cream
bar. He sees three pretty girls, one with blonde hair like Petulia’s.
But it’s the dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back. Archie,
watching the girl, and eating his ice cream, leans against an electrical
appliance shop window. Inside, among endless other items is a single
T.V. tube, on which the world’s violence flickers silently and unnoticed
as before. As we leave Archie, we feel a sense of euphoria – well, what
do you know, it all ended rather sweetly after all.</p>
<p><strong>petulia</strong>: Archie .?</p>
