<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The time – 7:15 A.M., WOR, New York. The
temperature, outside, 84 – Friends – is your life worth one dollar?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Indo-China – Jeff predicted it would go
sky-high.</p>
<p><strong>bryce</strong>: From the looks of Davidson’s cable, it might
even go higher than that. And we haven’t even got a camera over
there.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: This could go off in a month – or an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>bryce</strong>: I’ll pull somebody out of Japan.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Bryce, the only man for this job is
sitting right here in town. Get me L. B. Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong>bryce</strong>: Jefferies?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Name me a better photographer.</p>
<p><strong>bryce</strong>: But his leg!</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Don’t worry – it comes off today.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: I mean the cast.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Congratulations, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: For getting rid of that cast.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who said I was getting rid of it?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: This is Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Gunnison – how did you get to be such a big
editor – with such a small memory?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Wrong day?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this
plaster cocoon.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: That’s too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I
can’t be lucky every day. Forget I called.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison.
Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole
week.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: That one week is going to cost me my best
photographer – and you a big assignment.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: There’s no point in even talking about
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau
chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Didn’t I tell you! Didn’t I tell you it was
the next place to watch?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: With that cast on – you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stop sounding stuffy. I’ll take pictures from
a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: You’re too valuable to the magazine for us
to play around with. I’ll send Morgan or Lambert.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Swell. I get myself half-killed for you – and
you reward me by stealing my assignments.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: I didn’t ask you to stand in the middle of
that automobile race track.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You asked for something dramatically
different! You got it!</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’ve got to get me out of here! Six weeks –
sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the
window at the neighbors!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s worse than the Chinese water torture.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Read some good books.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ve been taking pictures so long I don’t know
how to read anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: I’ll send you some comic books.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Listen – if you don’t pull me out of this
swamp of boredom – I’ll do something drastic.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ll – I’ll get married. Then I’ll never be
able to go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: It’s about time you got married – before
you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can you see me – rushing home to a hot
apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric
dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Jeff – wives don’t nag anymore – they
discuss.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they
discuss – but in my neighborhood, they still nag.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Well – you know best. Call you later,
Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Next time, have some good news.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: The New York State sentence for a peeping
Tom is six months in the workhouse!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello Stella.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: And there aren’t any windows in the
workhouse.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Years ago, they used to put out your eyes
with a hot poker. Is one of those bikini bombshells you always watch
worth a hot poker?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: We’ve grown to be a race of peeping Toms.
What people should do is stand outside their own houses and look in once
in a while. What do you think of that for homespun philosophy?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Readers’ Digest, April, 1939.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Well, I only quote from the best.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now look, Stella –</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: See it you can break a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I shoulda been a Gypsy fortune teller,
instead of an insurance company nurse. I got a nose for trouble – can
smell it ten miles away. You heard of the stock market crash in ’29?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I predicted it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Simple. I was nursing a director of General
Motors. Kidney ailment they said. Nerves, I said. Then I asked myself –
what’s General Motors got to be nervous about? Overproduction. Collapse,
I answered. When General Motors has to go to the bathroom ten times a
day – the whole country’s ready to let go.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella – in economics, a kidney ailment has no
relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: It crashed, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I can smell trouble right in this apartment.
You broke your leg. You look out the window. You see things you
shouldn’t. Trouble. I can see you now, in front of the judge, flanked by
lawyers in blue double- breasted suits. You’re pleading, “Judge, it was
only innocent fun. I love my neighbors like a father.” – The Judge
answers, “Congratulations. You just gave birth to three years in
Dannemora.”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Right now I’d even welcome trouble.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You’ve got a hormone deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How can you tell that from a thermometer!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch
haven’t raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I think you’re right. There is going to be
some trouble around here.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t you ever heat that stuff up.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Gives your circulation something to fight.
What kind of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa Fremont.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You must be kidding. A beautiful young
woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She expects me to marry her.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: That’s normal.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: That’s abnormal.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m not ready for marriage.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage
– with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man
with half a brain, who can get one eye open.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Behind every ridiculous statement is always
hidden the true cause. What is it? You have a fight?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Her father loading up the shotgun?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: It’s happened before, you know! Some of the
world’s happiest marriage have started ‘under the gun’ you might
say.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She’s just not the girl for me.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: She’s only perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too
sophisticated, too everything – but what I want.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Is what you want something you can
discuss?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s very simple. She belongs in that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail
parties.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: People with sense can belong wherever
they’re put.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can you see her tramping around the world with
a camera bum who never has more than a week’s salary in the bank? If
only she was ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You’re never going to marry?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Probably. But when I do, it’ll be to someone
who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the
latest scandal. I need a woman who’ll go anywhere, do anything, and love
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The only honest thing to do is call it off.
Let her look for somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I can just hear you now. “Get out of here
you perfect, wonderful woman! You’re too good for me!”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s the hard part.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Look, Mr. Jefferies. I’m not educated. I’m
not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this – when a man and a woman
see each other, and like each other – they should come together – wham
like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like
specimens in at bottle.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s an intelligent way to approach
marriage.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human
race more trouble. Modern marriage!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ve progressed emotionally in –</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get
excited, get married – Now, it’s read books, fence with four syllable
words, psychoanalyze each other until you can’t tell a petting party
from a civil service exam</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: People have different emotional levels that
–</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there’s
a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the
street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? – Because she
only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: When I married Myles, we were both
maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we’ve loved every minute of
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s fine, Stella. Now would you make me a
sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Okay – but I’m going to spread some common
sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont’s loaded to her fingertips with love
for you. I’ll give you two words of advice. Marry her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She pay you much?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Window shopper.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How’s your leg?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Mmmm – hurts a little.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And your stomach?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Empty as a football.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And you love life?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not too active.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Anything else bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Reading from top to bottom – Lisa –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Carol –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Fremont.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same
dress twice?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Only because it’s expected of her.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Right off the Paris plane. Think it will
sell?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Depends on the quote. Let’s see – there’s the
plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: – A steal at eleven hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That dress should be listed on the stock
exchange.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We sell a dozen a day in this price range.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who buys them? Tax collectors?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Even if I had to pay, it would be worth it –
just for the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Something big going on somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Going on right here. It’s a big night.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The
calendar’s loaded with them.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s opening night of the last depressing week
of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hasn’t been any big demand for tickets.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s because I bought out the house. This
cigarette box has seen better days.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Picked it up in Shanghai – which has also seen
better days.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s cracked – and you never use it. And it’s
too ornate. I’m sending up a plain, flat silver one – with just your
initials engraved.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now that’s no way to spend your hard- earned
money!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I wanted to, Jeff. Oh!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What would you think of starting off with
dinner at the “21”?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Better than that. The “21.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thank you for waiting Carl.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Kitchen’s on the left. I’ll take the wine.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Good evening, Mr Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Just put everything right in the oven Carl. On
“low.”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Let’s open the wine now. It’s a
Montrachet.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: A big glassful.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Big enough?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fine. Corkscrew’s on the right.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I couldn’t think of anything more boring and
tiresome than what you’ve been through. And the last week must be the
hardest.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah – I want to get this thing off and get
moving.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, I’m going to make this a week you’ll
never forget.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Let me, madam.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This will take care of the taxi as well.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thank you, Miss Fremont.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Have a pleasant dinner, Mr. Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What a day I’ve had!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tired?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales
meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne
– just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the “21” for
lunch with the Harper’s Bazaar people – that’s when I ordered dinner.
Then two Fall showings – twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a
cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward – we’re trying to get his next
show. Then I had to dash back and change.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tell me – what was Slim Hayward wearing?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She looked very cool. She had on a mint green
–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And to think, I planted three nice items about
you in the columns today.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You can’t buy that kind of publicity.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s good news.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Someday you might want to open up your own
studio here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How could I run it from say – Pakistan?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – isn’t it time you came home? You could
pick your assignment.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I wish there was one I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Make the one you want.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You mean leave the magazine?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: For yourself – and me. I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow… fashion, portraits –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Don’t laugh. – I could do it!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s what I’m afraid of. Could you see me –
driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep – wearing combat boots and a
three day beard?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I could see you looking handsome and
successful in a dark blue flannel suit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Let’s not talk any more nonsense, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’d better start setting up for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s what is know as “manless
melancholia.”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that’s something
you’ll never have to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on
63rd street?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not exactly – but we have a little apartment
here that’s probably about as popular as yours. You, of course, remember
Miss Torso.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, she picked the most prosperous looking
one.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She’s not in love with him – or any of
them.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How can you tell that – from here?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You said it resembled my apartment, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Where’s that music coming from?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh… some songwriter. In the studio apartment.
Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I think it’s enchanting.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Almost as if it were being written especially
for us.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No wonder he’s having so much trouble with
it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, at least you can’t say the dinner isn’t
right.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa, it’s perfect As always.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: There can’t be that much difference between
people and the way they live! We all eat, talk, drink, laugh, sleep,
wear clothes –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well now, look –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: If you’re saying all this just because you
don’t want to tell me the truth, because you’re hiding something from
me, then maybe I can understand –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s nothing I’m hiding. It’s just that
–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It doesn’t make sense to me. What’s so
different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one
person couldn’t live in both places just as easily?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Some people can. Now if you’ll let me explain
–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What is it but traveling from one place to
another, taking pictures? It’s just like being a tourist on an endless
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: All right. That’s your opinion. You’re
entitled to it, but –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s ridiculous for you to say that it can
only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I made a simple, but true statement and I’ll
back it up, if you’ll just shut up for a minute!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: If your opinion is as rude as your manner, I’m
not sure I want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa, simmer down – will you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You can’t fit in here – I can’t fit in there.
According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You might have to, if you went with me. Ever
try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below
zero?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a
few minutes after lunch.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at
night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Those high heels would be a lot of use in the
jungle – and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, they’d be very stylish in Finland – just
before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: If there’s one thing I know, it’s how to wear
the proper clothes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even
when it isn’t raining Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your
home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less,
and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff, you don’t have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: If anything, I’m making it sound good. Let’s
face it, Lisa… you aren’t made for that kind of a life. Few people
are.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re too stubborn to argue with.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m not stubborn! I’m truthful!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I know. A lesser man would have told me it was
one long holiday – and I would have awakened to a rude
disillusionment.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now if you want to get vicious, I’d be very
happy to accommodate you!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No. I don’t particularly want that. So that’s
it. You won’t stay here – I can’t go with you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It would be the wrong thing.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You don’t think either one of us could ever
change?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Right now, it doesn’t seem so.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m in love with you. I don’t care what you do
for a living. Somehow I would just like to be part of it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And it’s deflating to find out that the only
way I can be part of it – is to take out a subscription to your
magazine. I guess I’m not the girl I thought I was.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have
the town in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Not quite – it seems. Goodbye, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You mean “goodnight.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I mean what I said.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can’t we just sort of keep things status
quo?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Without any future?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well – when’ll I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Not for a long time. Not, at least until – –
tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Gunnison?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The word is “everything.” Now what time does
my plane leave Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Jeff –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t care where it goes – just as long as
I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We’ll pick you
up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.</p>
<p><strong>gunnison</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You’d think the rain would have cooled
things off. All it did was make the heat wet.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s a stiff one.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: The insurance Company would be a lot happier
if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How did you know!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out
the window for hours.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What’ll you do if one of them catches
you?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Depends one which one.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now Miss Torso, for example –</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Keep your mind off her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She’s real eat, drink and be merry girl.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: And she’ll end up fat, alcoholic and
miserable.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank
herself to sleep again. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Poor girl. Someday she’ll find her
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And some man will lose his.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Isn’t there anyone in the neighborhood who
might cast an eye in her direction?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, the salesman could be available
soon.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: He and his wife splitting up?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s hard to figure. He went out several time
last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Isn’t he a salesman?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now what could he sell at three in the
morning?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches.
House numbers that light up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He was taking something out of the apartment.
I’m certain.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: His personal effects. He’s probably running
away – the coward.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sometimes it’s worse to stay than it is to
run.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: But it takes a particularly low type of man
to do it.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What about this morning? Any
developments?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No. The shades are still drawn in their
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: In this heat? They’re up now.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Get back! Out of sight! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What is it? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The salesman’s looking out his window.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: A Federal offense.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Get back there! He’ll see you!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I’m not shy. I’ve been looked at before.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s not an ordinary look. It’s the kind of
look a man gives when he’s afraid somebody might be watching him.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I’ll see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: And don’t sleep in the chair again.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Great conversationalist.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Will you take those binoculars out of the case
and bring them to me.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Trouble. I cam smell it. I’ll be glad when
they crack that cast, and I get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How far does a girl have to go – before you
notice her?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: If she’s pretty enough, she doesn’t have to go
anywhere. She just has to “be”.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, “ain’t I?” – Pay attention to me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m not exactly on the other side of the
room.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want
all of him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t you ever have any problems?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I have one now.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why would a man leave his apartment three
times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He likes the way his wife welcomes him
home.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not that salesman’s wife. And why didn’t he go
to work today?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Homework. It’s more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s interesting about a butcher’s knife and
a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Nothing, thank heaven.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why hasn’t he gone into his wife’s bedroom all
day?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I wouldn’t dare answer that.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa – there’s something terribly wrong.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And I’m afraid it’s with me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Something too frightful to utter.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He went out a few minutes ago – in his
undershirt – and he hasn’t come back yet.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know – that would be terrible job to
tackle.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How would you begin to cut up a human
body?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – I’ll be honest with you – you’re
beginning to scare me a little.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – did you hear what I said? You’re
beginning to –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Be quiet! Shhh! He’s coming back!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – if you could only see yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now, Lisa –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Sitting around, looking out a window to kill
time, is one thing – but doing it the way you are – – with, with
binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see –
is, is diseased!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do you think I consider this recreation?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I don’t know what you consider it – but if you
don’t stop it, I’m getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’d better before you catch the disease!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What is it you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I want to find out what’s wrong with the
salesman’s wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What makes you think something’s wrong with
her?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: A lot of things. She’s an invalid who needs
constant care – and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there
all day.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Maybe she died.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where’s the doctor – the undertakers?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She could be under sedatives, sleeping. He’s
in the room now.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa, please!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: There’s nothing to see.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There is – I’ve seen things through that
window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives,
saws, rope – and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife!
Now you tell me where she is and what she’s doing!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Maybe he’s leaving his wife. I don’t know, and
I don’t care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their
houses. Lots of men don’t speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives
nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts – but very, very, very few of
them end up in murder – if that’s what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s pretty hard to stay away from that word
isn’t is?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You could see all the things he did, couldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What are you getting at?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You could see that he did because he had the
shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the
streets and the backyard?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you
see all that? That he shouldn’t keep his shades down and hide behind
them?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s where he’s being clever. Acting
nonchalant.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And that’s where you’re not being clever. He
wouldn’t parade his crime in front of the open shades.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: For all you know – there’s something a lot
more sinister going on behind those shades.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No comment.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Don’t you see how silly you’re being?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, Lisa – probably you’re right. He’s
probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope
trick. I’ll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the
cure?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Let’s start from the beginning again, Jeff.
Tell me everything you saw – and what you think it means.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The name on the second floor rear mailbox
reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that’s L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s the apartment house number?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: 125 West Ninth Street.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thanks, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Okay, chief. What’s my next assignment.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: To get on home.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: All right – but what’s he doing now?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just sitting in the living room. In the dark.
And he hasn’t gone near the bedroom. Now get some sleep. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look, Doyle – it’s just one of those things I
can’t tell you on the phone. You have to be here, and see the whole
set-up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s probably nothing important – just a
little neighborhood murder, that’s all. As a matter of fact, I did say
“murder”.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: My only thought was to throw a little business
your way. A good detective, I reasoned, would jump at the chance to
detect.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, I usually took my best pictures on my
day off. Okay, Doyle – soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella, I – I can’t tell you what a welcome
sight this is. No wonder your husband’s still in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Police?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You called the police?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn’t an official
call. He’s just a friend. An old, ornery friend.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Now just where do you suppose he cut her
up?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Oh – of course! In the bathtub. That’s the
only place he could wash away the blood.</p>
<p><strong>stella’s voice</strong>: He’d better get that trunk out of
there before is starts to leak.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: H-a-a-r-r-e-e…</p>
<p><strong>stella’s voice</strong>: Look! Look – Mr. Jefferies!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I thought Doyle would get here before the
trunk went – or I’d have called the police. Now we’re going to lose
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella, don’t do anything reckless!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I’m just going to get the name of their
truck!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ll watch the alleyway – in case it goes that
way.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Long Distance.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You didn’t see the killing, or the body? How
do you know there was a murder?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Because everything that man’s done has been
suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope,
and a wife that isn’t there any more.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I’ll admit it all has a mysterious sound –
but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least
likely.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Go ahead, Doyle – tell me he’s an unemployed
magician – amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: It’s too stupid and obvious a way to murder –
in full view of fifty windows – and then sit over there – – smoking a
cigar – waiting for the police to pick him up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, officer – do your duty.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You’ve got a lot to lean about homicide,
Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred
trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn’t just knock
off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in
storage.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ll bet it’s been done.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Almost everything’s been done – under panic.
But this is a thousand to one shot. That man’s still sitting around his
apartment; he isn’t panicked.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You think I made all this up?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I think you saw something – that probably has
a very simple explanation.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: For instance?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: His wife took a trip.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She – was – an – invalid!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You told me. I’ve got to run, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: All right – you don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I – uh – won’t report it to the Department.
Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any
ridiculous publicity.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We know the wife is gone. I’ll see if I can
find out where.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do that.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You have any headaches lately?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not ’til you showed up.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Uh-huh. Well, it’ll wear off in time – along
with the hallucinations. See you around.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: By the way what happened to your leg?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I was jaywalking.</p>
<p><strong>doyle’s voice</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The Indianapolis Speedway.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: During the race?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yup. It sure stopped traffic.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: He has a six months lease, and has used up a
little over five and a half months of it. Quiet. Drinks, but not to
drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume
jewelry salesman – wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the
neighbors got close to him, or his wife.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I think they missed their chance with her.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: She never left the apartment –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Then where is she – in the ice box?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: – until yesterday morning.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What time?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Six ayem.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I think that’s about the time I fell
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the
apartment house at that time.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Feel a little foolish?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How’s your wife?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Oh – oh, she’s fine. Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who said they left then?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Who left – where?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The Thorwalds – at six in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The building superintendent, and two tenants.
Flat statements – no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The
Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now how could anybody guess that? They had,
perhaps, signs on their luggage, “Grand Central Or Bust!”?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The superintendent met Thorwald coming back.
He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the
country.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: A very convenient guy – this superintendent.
Have you checked his bank deposits lately?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Jeff – huh?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well – what good is his information?!! It’s a
second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself
– Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I hate to remind you – but this all started
because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Doyle – are you interested in solving a case,
or making me look foolish?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If possible – both.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well then do a good job of it! Get over there,
and search Thorwald’s apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a
drink, or something. What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I can’t do it even if he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s the matter? Does he have a courtesy
card from the police department?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Now don’t get me mad! Even a detective can’t
walk in anybody’s apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in
there, I’d lose my badge inside of ten minutes!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just make sure you’re not caught. If you find
something, you’ve got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of
house rules. If you find nothing – he’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff – I’ll
remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase “search warrant” issued
by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Give him evidence.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I can hear myself starting out. “Your Honor –
I have a friend who’s an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy
supper –” He’d throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. –
And it’s six volumes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: By morning there might not be anything left to
find in his apartment.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: A detective’s nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What do you need before you can search –
bloody footsteps leading up to the door?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: One thing I don’t need is heckling! You
called and asked me for help – and now you’re acting like a
taxpayer!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: How did we ever stand each other in that same
plane for three years?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know, every day for three years I asked
myself that same question?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Ever get an answer?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah – frequently – it ran something like
this: “Your request for transfer turned down –”</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Sorry I had to turn it down. I’m going over
to the railroad station and check Thorwald’s story.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Forget the story – find the trunk.
Mrs. Thorwald’s in it!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Oh – I almost forgot!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: There was a postcard in Thorwald’s mailbox.
Mailed yesterday afternoon, three- thirty P.M. from Merritsville – –
That’s eighty miles north of here. The message read “Arrived O.K.
Already feeling better. Love, Anna.”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Is – is Anna – who I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Mrs. Thorwald.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Anything you need?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah. A good detective.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Mrs. Doyle?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: Not yet, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You haven’t even heard from him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: Not a word.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: It is something really important,
Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m afraid it is, Tess.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: I’ll have him call the moment I hear
from him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tell him not to waste time calling. To get
over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald’s pulling out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: Who’s Thorwald?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He knows. Don’t worry, Tess. It’s a man.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. doyle</strong>: Goodnight, you idiot.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Long distance again.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Quick. Take a look. Thorwald’s getting ready
to pull out for good!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It doesn’t seem to be in any hurry.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He was just laying all his things out on one
of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife’s –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost
–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at
least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called
somebody long distance. – His wife’s jewelry was in the handbag. And
something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Someone not his wife?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I never saw him ask her for advise before. But
she volunteered plenty.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I wonder where he’s going now?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Suppose he doesn’t come back again?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He will. All his things are still piled on the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, I guess it’s safe to put on some lights
now.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not yet!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He must have gone somewhere to the right.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: All day long I’ve tried to keep my mind on
work.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thinking about Thorwald?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And you, and you friend Doyle – Did you hear
from him again – since he left?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not a word. He was going to check on the
railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Something on your mind, Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It doesn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Women aren’t that unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa – I can’t guess what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: A woman has a favorite handbag – it always
hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and
leaves it behind. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Because she didn’t know she was going on a
trip – and where she was going she wouldn’t need a handbag.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But only her husband would know that. And the
jewelry! Women don’t keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled,
getting scratched and twisted up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do they hide it in their husband’s
clothes?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: They do not! And they don’t leave it behind
them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup,
perfume and jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Inside stuff?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Basic equipment. You don’t leave it behind in
your husband’s drawer in your favorite handbag.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J.
Doyle has a pat answer for that.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday
with her husband?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s what the witnesses told him.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle –
that couldn’t be Mrs. Thorwald – or I don’t know women.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Still – those witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We’ll agree they saw a woman – but she wasn’t
Mrs. Thorwald. – That is, yet.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’d like to see your friend’s face when we
tell him. He doesn’t sound like much of a detective.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t be too hard on him. He’s a steady
worker. I wish he’d get there, though.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Don’t rush me. We have all night.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We have all – what?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Night. I’m going to stay with you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’ll have to clear that through my landlord
–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I have the whole weekend off.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well that’s fine, but I only have one bed, and
–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Say anything else, and I’ll stay tomorrow
night too.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa, I won’t be able to give you any –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: – pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You said I’d have to live out of one suitcase
I’ll bet yours isn’t this small?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s a suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact,
but ample enough.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll trade you – my feminine intuition for a
bed for the night.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’d be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: There’s that song again.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Where does a man get the inspiration for a
song like that?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: From his landlord – once a month.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s utterly beautiful. I wish I could be
creative.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You are. You have a talent for creating
difficult situations.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Staying the night here, uninvited.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Surprise – is the most important element of
attack. And beside, you’re not up on your private eye literature. When
they’re in trouble, it’s always their Girl Friday who gets them out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The same girl who keeps him out of the
clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the
rich.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The same.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But he never ends up marrying her.
Strange.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Weird. Why don’t I slip into something
comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You mean – like the kitchen? And make us some
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Exactly what I had in mind – along with some
brandy.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: H-a-a-r-r-e-e-!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What else do you have on this man
Thorwald?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Enough to scare me that you wouldn’t get here
in time, and we’d lose him.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You think he’s getting out of here?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom,
ready for packing.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m just warming some brandy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Mr. Doyle? – I presume.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We think Thorwald’s guilty.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Careful, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hallo?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just a minute, please.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Doyle speaking. Uh-huh. – Yeah. Mummmm – Mmm.
Hmm – Okay. Thank you, and goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The coffee will be ready soon. Jeff, aren’t
you going to tell him about the jewelry?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Jewelry?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He has his wife’s jewelry hidden in among his
clothes over there.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You sure it belongs to his wife?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It was in her favorite handbag – And,
Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Namely?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That wasn’t Mrs. Thorwald who left with him
yesterday morning?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You figured that out, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s just that women don’t leave jewelry
behind when they go on a trip.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Come on, Tom – you don’t really need any of
this information, do you?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: As a matter of fact, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Lars Thorwald is no more a murderer than I
am.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You mean you can explain everything that went
on over there – and is still going on?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And neither can you. That’s a secret and
private world you’re looking into out there. People do a lot at things
in private that they couldn’t explain in public.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Like disposing of their wives?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Get that idea out of your mind. It will only
lead you in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But Tom – the saw, the knives –</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Did you ever own a saw?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, in the garage, back home, we –</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And how many people did you cut up with the
couple of with it? Or hundred knives you’ve probably owned in your
lifetime?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But I’m not a killer!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Your logic is backward.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You can’t ignore the wife disappearing! And
the trunk – and the jewelry – !</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I checked the railroad station. He bought a
ticket. He put her on the train ten minutes later. Destination:
Merritsville. Witnesses. This deep.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It might have been a woman – but it couldn’t
have been Mrs. Thorwald. That jewelry –</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Look, Miss Fremont. That feminine intuition
sells magazines – but in real life, it’s still a fairy tale. I don’t
know how many wasted years I’ve spent running down leads based on
women’s intuitions.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I take it you didn’t find the trunk – And this
is just an old speech you once gave at the Policeman’s Ball.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I found the trunk – a half hour after I left
here.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Of course, it’s normal for a man to tie his
trunk up with a heavy rope.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: When the lock is broken – yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What was in the trunk? A surly note to me?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Mrs. – Thorwald’s – clothes. – Clean –
carefully packed – not too stylish – but presentable.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Didn’t you take it to the crime lab?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I sent it on its merry and legal way.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why – when a woman only goes on a simple trip,
does she take everything she owns?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Let the female psychology department handle
that one.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I would say that is looked as if she wasn’t
coming back.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That’s what they call a family problem.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: If his wife wasn’t coming back – why didn’t he
tell his landlord? – I’ll answer it for you – because he had something
to hide.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Do – uh – you tell your landlord
everything?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I told you to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If I’d been careful piloting that
reconnaissance plane, you wouldn’t have taken the kind of pictures that
got you a medal, a big job, fame, money –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: All the things I hate.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Now – what do you say we sit down to a quiet,
friendly drink or two – forget all about this, and tell lies about the
old days in the war? Hmmm? He looks from one to the other.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re through with the case?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: There isn’t any “case” to be through with,
Miss Fremont. Now let’s get down to that friendly drink.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Maybe you’re right. I guess I’d better get
home and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I’m not much of a snifter.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If you need any more help, Jeff – consult the
yellow pages of your telephone directory.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I hate funny exit lines.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who was the trunk addressed to?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Mrs. Anna Thorwald.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Let’s wait and see who picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Oh – that phone call! I gave them your number
– hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That depends on who “they” were.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The police Department at Merritsville. They
called to report. The trunk was just picked up – by Mrs. Anna
Thorwald.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t stay up too late.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: As much as I hate to give Thomas J. Doyle too
much credit, he might have gotten a hold of something when he said this
was pretty private stuff going on out there.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do you suppose it’s ethical to watch a man
with binoculars, and a long- focus lens – until you can see the freckles
on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail – do you suppose it’s
ethical even if you prove he didn’t commit a crime?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m not much on rear window ethics.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Of course, they have the same chance. They can
look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – if anybody walked in here, I don’t
think they’d believe what they see.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You and me with long faces – plunged into
despair – because we find out that a man didn’t kill his wife. We’re two
of the most frightening ghouls I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’d think we could be a little bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Whatever happened to that old saying “Love Thy
Neighbor.”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I think I’ll start reviving it tomorrow, with
say – Miss Torso for a start?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Not if I have to move into an apartment across
the courtyard and do the dance of the seven veils once an hour. Show’s
over for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Preview – of the coming attractions.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, Lisa – I don’t think he did.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll rephrase the question.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, – if there was one less thread this way
– – and two less that way – – I might give up bachelorhood.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>lonely hearts</strong>: It’s dead! It’s been strangled and
the neck is broken!</p>
<p><strong>siffleuse</strong>: Which one of you did it? Which one of you
killed my dog? You don’t know the meaning of the word “neighbor”.
Neighbors like each other – speak to each other – care if anybody lives
or dies. But none of you do! You don’t talk, you don’t help, you – you
don’t — Even see. But I couldn’t imagine any Even of you being so low
that you’d kill a little helpless, friendly dog! The only thing in this
whole neighborhood who liked anybody!</p>
<p><strong>siffleuse</strong>: Did you kill him because he liked you?
Just because he liked you?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I
was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But you’re not?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: In the whole courtyard, only one person didn’t
come to the window.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why would Thorwald want to kill a dog? Because
it knew too much?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do you think this was worth waiting all day to
see?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Is he cleaning house?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s washing down the bathroom walls.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Must have splattered a lot.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Well, why not? That’s what we’re all
thinking. He killed her in there, and he has to wipe up the stains
before he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Stella, your choice of words –</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Nobody’s invented polite words yet for
killing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa – Lisa – on the shelf over there – get me
the small yellow box –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And that little viewer.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: These aren’t more than two weeks old – I hope
I didn’t take all leg art. I think this is the one.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – what are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Something – that if I’m right – might solve a
murder.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Mrs. Thorwald?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why
Thorwald killed it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You take a look and tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now take it away.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s just a picture of the backyard, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know. But there’s one important change. The
flowers in Thorwald’s pet flower bed.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You mean the one the dog was sniffing
around?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And digging in. Look at that flower bed.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s a dip at this end. And since when do
flowers grow shorter in two weeks?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: There’s something buried there.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Mrs. Thorwald!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You haven’t spent much time in cemeteries,
have you? Mr. Thorwald could hardly put his wife into a plot of ground
scarcely one foot square.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Unless, he puts in standing on end – which
would be very original and not require the use of either a knife or a
saw. My guess is she’s scattered all over town. A leg in the East River
– an arm –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Stella, please.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Something’s in there. Those flowers have been
taken up, and put back again.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It could be – the knife, and the saw.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Call Lieutenant Doyle!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No – let’s wait. Let’s wait until it gets
dark. I’ll go over and dig it up!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m not going to call Doyle until I show him
the body of Mrs. Thorwald – And you’re not going to dig up anything, an
get your neck broken too.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What we’ve got to do is find some way to get
in there, and –</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: He’s starting to pack.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What are you going back for?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You did it, Thorwald! You did it!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa! Look out! He’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You shouldn’t have let her do that! If he
ever –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Thank heaven that’s over!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I have a feeling we’ve just begun.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No doubt of it. He’s leaving. The question is
– when?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Mind if I use the portable keyhole?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Not as long as you tell me what you’re looking
at.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I wonder.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something
that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You can tell that from here?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I handled enough of those red pills to put
everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Would four of them – ?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: No – but it makes the rest easy to take. And
she’s reading the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Then I wouldn’t worry too much. But let’s keep
an eye on her.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You know? You might not be too bad a bargain
for Lisa after all.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t say! I might just take that
compliment as an insult.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Wasn’t that close?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Too close.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What was his reaction? I mean when he looked
at the note?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Well, it wasn’t the kind of expression that
would get him a quick loan at the bank.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – how did I do?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Real professional. Would have made a great
layout for the Bazaar. The model pressed back against a brick wall, eyes
wild, tense. Low cut bodice, in new suspicious black, with a –</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You’d make a good door prize at a wake.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff – the handbag.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Suppose Mrs. Thorwald’s wedding ring was among
the jewelry he has in the handbag. During that phone conversation he
held up three rings – one with a diamond – one with a big stone of some
kind – and one plain gold band.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And the last thing she’d leave behind would be
her wedding ring! Do you ever leave yours at home?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: The only way anybody could get that off
would be to chop my finger – Let’s go down and find out what’s buried in
the garden.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why not? I always wanted to meet
Mrs. Thorwald.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What are you two talking about?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Got a shovel?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: There’s probably one in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now wait a minute –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jeff, if you’re squeamish, just don’t
look.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now hold on. I’m not a bit squeamish about
what might be under those flowers – but I don’t care to watch two women
end up like that dog –</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You know, Miss Fremont – he might just have
something there.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s no point in taking unnecessary
chances. Give me the phone book, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: We only need a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ll try to give you at least fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Chelsea 2-7099. We scared him once. Maybe we
can scare him again. I’m using that word “we” a little too freely, I
guess. I don’t take any of the chances.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Shall we vote him in, Stella?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Unanimously.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Go ahead, Thorwald – pick it up. You’re
curious. You wonder if it’s your girl friend calling. The one you killed
for. Pick it up, Thorwald!</p>
<p><strong>thorwald</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did you get my note?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well – did you get it, Thorwald?</p>
<p><strong>thorwald</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in
the bar at the Brevoort – and do it right away.</p>
<p><strong>thorwald</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: For a little business meeting – to settle the
estate of your late wife.</p>
<p><strong>thorwald</strong>: I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I’ll hang
up and call the police.</p>
<p><strong>thorwald</strong>: I only have a hundred dollars or so.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s a start. I’m at the Brevoort now. I’ll
be looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Let’s go, Stella.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: One of you watch this window. If I see him
coming back, I’ll signal with a flashbulb.</p>
<p><strong>baby sitter</strong>: This is Doyle’s house.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom’s.
Who am I talking with?</p>
<p><strong>baby sitter</strong>: This is the baby sitter.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh. When are they expected home?</p>
<p><strong>baby sitter</strong>: I’m hired ’til one. They went to dinner
and maybe night-clubbing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch
with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for
him.</p>
<p><strong>baby sitter</strong>: Does he have your number,
Mr. Jefferies?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He has it. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>baby sitter</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa – no!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Come on. Come on! Get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Ring Thorwald’s phone the second you see him
on the way back!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m going to ring him now!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Give her another minute – She’s doing this
for you.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Miss Lonely Hearts!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Call the police!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Maybe that music will delay her taking the
pills.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Lisa! Lisa!</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: Precinct Six – Sergeant Allgood.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: Precinct Six – Sergeant Allgood.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: A man is assaulting a woman at one two five
west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: L. B. Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: Phone number?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Chelsea 2-5598.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella – what can we do?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: There they are.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What’s she trying to do? Why doesn’t she
turn him in?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Smart girl.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Smart? She’ll be arrested!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’ll get her out of there, won’t it?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Mrs. Thorwald’s ring!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella! The lights! He’d seen us!</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: When you took your first snapshot – did you
ever think it would bring you to this?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Stella – how long do you think he’ll stay
there?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Unless he’s dumber than I think, he won’t
wait ’til his lease is up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: My billfold! In the right hand drawer.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What do you need money for?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: To bail Lisa out of jail.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You know – you could just leave her there
until after next Tuesday – so you could sneak away safely – as
planned.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: One hundred and twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: How much do you think you’ll need?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: First offense burglary – – probably two-fifty.
The piggy bank.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Ten here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not
enough.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what
you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What about the rest?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont –
they’ll even contribute.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just a minute. I’ll tell you who it is when
you get back.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: This is Doyle, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tom, I’ve got something real big for you.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Look Jeff, don’t louse up my night with
another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Listen to me! Lisa’s been arrested.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Your Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: My Lisa. She went into Thorwald’s apartment,
and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the
police.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I told you that –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know what you told me! She went in to get
evidence, and she came out with it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Like Mrs. Thorwald’s wedding ring. If that
woman were still alive, she’d be wearing it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: A possibility.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing
in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something
a dog could scent.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Like an old hambone?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know what pet name Thorwald had for
his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal
suitcase. He wasn’t taking his possessions, because they’re up in his
apartment now!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You think perhaps it was “old hambone?”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom
– it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long
distance! If he called his wife the day she left – after she arrived in
Merritsville – why did she need to send him a postcard saying she’d
arrived?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where’d they take Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail
money.</p>
