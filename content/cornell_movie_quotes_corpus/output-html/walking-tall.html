<p><strong>chris</strong>: I just wanna relax, catch my breath.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You? Relax?</p>

body for bus fare.</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: He had to walk!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Nobody’s gonna have any problems finding this
place.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s the subtle attention to aesthetics that I
find most impressive, blends in with the mountains SO nicely.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: Not bad huh?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Isn’t it wonderful? All your gambling needs
under one great big roof. You got your ATM machine, tellers to cash your
paycheck, and when you’re here you don’t gotta worry about those lil
things like child support, rent, the laws of mathematical
probability.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Gentlemen, Mr Hamilton would like to invite
you to the VIP lounge.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, ‘Mister’ Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Heyyy, the dream team!</p>

much. And if you need a lil female companionship… done. Alright? Have a
good time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where you goin?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Don’t you worry about me, I’ve got a few things
to do. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just remember, nothin in here’s free. C’mon,
this place is nothin but fake boobs and real assholes if ya ask me. Just
water for me.</p>
<p><strong>friends</strong>: Here’s to you Chris.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: Don’t say we never did nothin’ for ya!</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: Don’t worry, everybody’s a lil scared the
first time. Get in there, sit back and enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: If you’re not back by morning we’ll send a
search party for you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Bye! No drinking.</p>
<p><strong>stripper</strong>: So you from here or just visiting.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Lil of both, I grew up here.</p>
<p><strong>stripper</strong>: So you’ve seen all the old faces.</p>

<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re good, but I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Saw what?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I saw the switch.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Hey this is a clean game asshole.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yea?</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Yea.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Let’s see about that.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Bet you I’ll roll a seven.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: It’s not your roll sir. SIR! It’s not your
roll. Call security.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Put your bets down on the pass line. These

<p><strong>bad guy 1</strong>: Special forces… special treatment.</p>
<p><strong>bad guy 2</strong>: This guy knows Hamilton!</p>
<p><strong>dochris</strong>: Folks, he’s pretty banged up, inside and
out. Whoever did this left him for dead. A lesser man wouldn’t have
survived.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: I’m gonna need a statement from him
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dochris</strong>: He’s in no condition to give you one.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: I’ll also need a copy of your
write-up along with toxicoloy, blood alcohol level and so on.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What are you talkin about Stan?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: I’m just tryin to get some facts
here.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Oh come on you need to be out arresting
whoever tried to kill my brother not testing his BLOOD.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: I’m just doing my job Michelle. Ok?
I understand how you feel. But we still don’t know yet who started all
of this.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Well it wasn’t Chris.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Just find out who did this to him Stan.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: I’ll do my best Mr Vaughn. I really
will. In the meantime I have to file a full report. You lemme know when
I can talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dochris</strong>: He’s gonna be fine Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: BEAUTIFUL flowers!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thank you, they’re for my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey sarge, so much for our VIP… status. Don’t
they teach you any fighting skills in the army.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How did you do?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not good. But I tell you, that guy was feelin
me this morning.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Some homecoming hey.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know if you’ve noticed but this aint
exactly home any more.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: There’s some old crutches in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Changed the plugs a while back.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Appreciate that Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I might’ve had serious issues with your career
choice but just didn’t seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headin?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I was goin into town to get some supplies.
Wanna come?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Ya whole life, all you wanted to do was get
outta here. What made you come back.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You gonna think I’m crazy. I been thinking
about the mill. When I was a kid goin to visit you at work, the smell of
that fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Mmm I remember a lotta nice things before the
mill closed.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: When did they go outta business? .</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Closed about six months ago. There’s a home
depot about fifteen minutes up the road.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And that?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey. First of all I wanna say thanks.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: He’s been fired, and his gaming permit’s been
pulled. I don’t know how my security cameras didn’t catch that.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They miss a lot at your place don’t they
Jay.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look Chris I hate seein ya like this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Your boys did it.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait wait… so they got a little rough, they
were a bit edgy. Understandably. You don’t know what kind of assholes
they have to put up with on a daily basis. Look, they’ve been
reprimanded. They say you went nuts man. I’m sorry. I know the proper
term vets use is post traumatic stress.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Whatever it was, you tore my place apart and it
wasn’t easy for me to get my guys agree not to press charges. Look
Chris, if you had a problem… shouldn’t you have come to me? Look, I
wanna bring you inside. Chris I wanna make you head of security. Whaddya
say?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Ah well. I guess you probably need time to
think about it. This is for you. It’s a little something to help you
get… Y’know..</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Come on man, don’t be like that. I came all the
way out here to your house just to see you get back on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m goin to the sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m sorry you feel that way. I’ll see ya round
Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: Well hey Chris. Good to see you up
and about, you’re lookin spiffy.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m here to press charges.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: Well this isn’t about that incident
at the casino a while back is it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yea, it is.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: Cause that matter’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Did you look into it?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: They did an internal investigation.
That’s good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: An internal investigation.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: Chris, I know you’re familiar with
the term ‘no fly zone’. Hmm? Cause that’s what the casino is. Since the
mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So, case closed basically. I’ll see ya.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m not gonna let this stand.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: Excuse me? What did you say to
me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I said I’m not gonna let this stand.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: You’re lucky to be alive right now,
that’s all you need to be concentrating on. This is my town ok, I’m the
sheriff here. I’ll tell you what will stand, not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: This belongs to you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I appreciate that, I thought this was
history.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Coulda left it in the trash but I…</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Deni? Nice to see you dear.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Hi Mrs Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Can I talk to you outside for a second. Mom
I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: How you been?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Been better.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Talked to the sheriff yet?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well I went down to the police station and I
talked to somebody with a badge. Sure as hell didn’t seem like much of a
sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: He’s up for re-election you know. Maybe you
could take his job.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Somebody ought to. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Sunshine and pine trees. Been readin these
books, teach you how to cultivate happiness. Books on the future, go
with the flow, that sorta thing.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Is it workin?</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: I have my moments.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So the casino huh?</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Yep. Been there almost a year.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Treatin you good?</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Lot better than it treated you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I like that. Jay Hamilton’s done well for
himself hasn’t he.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Yea, he’s a real go-getter that one.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Must be. I heard he got you.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You still work for him though.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Rent’s gotta be paid Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Hope to see you around.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thanks for the jacket.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: And where is he?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It’s ok mom he’s stabilised. It was close.
Crystal Meth.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m sorry. I never did it before.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It’s true. We mighta kinda pushed him into
it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where’d you get the drugs?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m not really sure…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Stop. Where?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: From the security guys workin at the
casino.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Chris, wait. Call the police.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, that won’t do any good.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Is Pete ok?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What are you doin?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen to me. If
you go outta here with that gun, they’re gonna.. ne… Chris!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Guess that changes our relationship a bit
huh?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff watkins</strong>: You should NOT have come looking
for trouble. Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris!
NOW!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: I advise you to give this offer more than a
little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years.
This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn’t even put it on the table
but your military record can’t be ignored. Three months home arrest,
some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But I’d have to plead guilty.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Look at it from the other side. There’s over
a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering
picture.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: He started bustin up the machines…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: There was a gunshot..</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Went crazy…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Complete psychopath.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They’re only offering me this deal just to
keep me quiet.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Well I still say you should take it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I wasn’t wrong. And I won’t say I was.</p>
<p><strong>casino guard</strong>: Our job is to keep order. But there
was no chance of that. Me and my men we were just tryin to control him.
He was highly trained, violent, very dangerous person.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: So dangerous, so violent, so highly
trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly. His
weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which in his hand became a
devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy property.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: He went directly for everything. He just
came in and took over the place.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: You said he broke your arm.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Yea that’s correct, my right forearm. Both
bones with a single shot. It was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>casino guard 2</strong>: You know, toss out a coupla drunks
now and then. Guys try to grope the girls, but ah nothing with this sort
of violence.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Did he give you any kind of advanced
warning? A chance to defend yourself.</p>
<p><strong>casino guard 2</strong>: We tussled, but he’s a big guy. He
was on a mission. Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself
from what I could see.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: So from what you saw, it seemed like he
had some kinda purpose?</p>
<p><strong>casino guard 2</strong>: I think he had a point to prove
yeah.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: I was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh came in
and started swingin.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I was tryin to get outta there.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr Crow, you may present your client’s
case.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Your honor, I’d like to plead my own
case.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Order, order. Mr Vaughn, if you choose to
represent yourself and not be represented by legal counsel you realise
that you can’t then claim a mistrial on that basis.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Very well Mr Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t deny anything that was said here
today.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Does that mean you’re changing your plea to
guilty?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m not guilty of anything. Except standing
up for myself when the law wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>opposition</strong>: Objection. He’s trying to introduce
prior events your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained. Mr Vaughn stay on point.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I grew up in this town. People used to walk
tall in this town, they wouldn’t have traded the mill for a crooked
casino.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr Vaughn we’re not here to listen to civic
speeches.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And they wouldn’t have stood around while
drugs were being sold to kids.</p>
<p><strong>opposition</strong>: Objection.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained. Mr Vaughn you’re close to being
held in contempt.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I was justified in what I did, and if you
acquit me of these charges I’m gonna run for sheriff. And if elected,
I’m gonna fix this town.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Order, order. Mr Vaughn you are now charged
with contempt.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And I will make sure that THIS never happens
to anyone again without punishing those who did it.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I order the jury to ignore what they have
just seen. Mr Vaughn take your seat. Order! Order!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr Forman, has the jury reached a
verdict?</p>
<p><strong>forman</strong>: We have your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Will the defendant please rise.</p>
<p><strong>forman</strong>: We find the defendant Chris Vaughn not
guilty.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This is mine.</p>
<p><strong>watkins</strong>: Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Watkins.</p>
<p><strong>watkins</strong>: Well you won the election, congratulations.
We do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here, and I can
personally vouch for each and every one of these men. They’re good
deputies.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re all fired.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: License and registration please.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re joking right?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: License and registration.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s the problem sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You. And the drugs you’re pedalling out of
your casino.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh. Only thing that’s going on in my casino
right now is reconstruction. You took care of that.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yea that’s right and I plan on taking care of
everything else too.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: If you can, try to think this through. A casino
is a license to print money. Why would I jeopardise that by selling
drugs?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Cause you owned the town Jay. It’s changed
now.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Really? See the only thing that I think has
changed around here is that every morning you get to wake up and put on
that nifty lil badge. But underneath that badge is the same guy that
couldn’t make it playing college football, apparently couldn’t make it
in the army and not gonna make it as a cop.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yea, and if you push too hard you’re gonna be a
man who doesn’t live to see 40. License please.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Thanks sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sir get your tail lights fixed, it’s your
last warning.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s wrong with my tail lights?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They’re broken.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mornin sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Mornin deputy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, nope, no. Come on man you know I hate cops.
You been sheriff 2 minutes and I’m already startin to hate you. I’m a
convicted felon.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I got a lil pull around here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh now you’re a CROOKED cop doing favours for
friends. That’s how it starts. See next thing you know you’ll be taking
bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking dudes crotches.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Are you done? Ray I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I need you to take me to drugs school.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I get to wear a uniform?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re SURE you’re not carrying anything.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I don’t have shit.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Officer.</p>

<p><strong>chris</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s clean. Guess we gotta move to plan</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Screw you, I do have a bit of information for
you. It’s not just me actually, there’s a whole lotta people in on this
one.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Spit it out.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You’re gonna get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Why does it always have to be your fight?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You might need this.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: No. I put my guns down a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re just being stubborn.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You and me both boy. Chris, listen. You be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Please step away from the vehicle. Now Mr Booth

<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m with you man, I’ll check in later.</p>

<p><strong>jay</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Got leftovers…</p>
<p><strong>deni</strong>: Mm mmm, I want pancakes, and eggs, and
bacon.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: WOOOOOOOOOOOO! I told you Vaughn! Uh ohhhh.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now Vaughn? Truck for truck
baby, that’s right, truck for a truck.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Pete, somethin’s burnin.</p>
