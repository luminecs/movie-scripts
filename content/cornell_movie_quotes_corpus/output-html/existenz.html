<p><strong>levi</strong>: Written like this. One word. Small e. Capital
X, capital Z. He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: eXistenZ. It’s new, it’s from Antenna
Research, and it’s here, right now. We now see Levi’s audience, about
seventy-five people, some standing, some sitting on plastic folding
chairs. They are of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and
applaud enthusiastically. We are in the central playing area of a small,
deconsecrated country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low,
carpeted plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman -
assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic
modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski boots.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: My name is Wittold Levi, my friends call me
Witt - and I’m the project manager for eXistenZ. I recognize some
familiar faces - that’s all right, that’s all right. We won’t throw you
out. We encourage consumer loyalty, and we want you to help us with our
product testing. We’re a team, Antenna and you. A delighted stir from
the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: Those of you who have come to our invited
seminars before will know that I normally lead the group through our new
games, but</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: tonight, it won’t be me. No, for the test
launch of eXistenZ by Antenna, we have brought you a seminar leader who
is rather special. An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be?</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: Yes, it is. The world’s greatest game designer
is here, in person, to lead you, the first test enclave, through her
newest creation, eXistenZ by Antenna… The small crowd is now
tremendously excited, wide-eyed, murmuring, one or two have actually
gotten on their knees.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess herself -
Allegra Geller! Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into
it until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to now has
hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security guard who is dressed
in a suit and tie but carries an electronic wand of some sort. His
name-tag identifies him as Ted Pikul , and we will see more of him
later. As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the crowd, her
fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part like water as she passes
amongst them, clutching her own personal game-pod case with both hands.
She mounts the dais like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog.
Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is bright,
acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she speaks, she is
deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: The world of games is in a kind of a trance.
People are programmed to accept so little, but the possibilities are so
great.</p>
<p>****: You probably thought that tonight, we were going to test a new
game that I designed. Excited murmurings from the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: But there is no new game to test, at least,
not in the usual sense. Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: No, no, it’s going to be much better than
you expected, because eXistenZ is not just a game. It’s an entirely new
game system. Antenna Research and I developed it together - the eXistenZ
System by Antenna - and it involves a whole lot of new toys, which you
are going to be the first to try out. The crowd’s spirit rises again.
Levi steps forward, smiling, playing off the renewed energy.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: MetaFlesh. Levi turns to the chalkboard and
writes the word.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: Written like this. One word. Capital M,
capital F. MetaFlesh is what our new toys are made of - the MetaFlesh
Game-Pod, only from Antenna Research. It connects with any industry
standard bioport, which I know you all have or you wouldn’t be here…
.using, however, a very non- standard connecting device which we call…
Levi turns again to the chalkboard.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: .we call an UmbyCord. Spelled like this. Levi
writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now- salivating
audience.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: I guess you can tell I started off as a
schoolteacher.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>: But I never had anything quite so fun or so
revolutionary to teach as what Allegra and I are going to teach you all
tonight. With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his two
assistants, who have finished laying out their devices on the back table
and are now standing crisply at attention at either end of it.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by Antenna
Research ready?</p>
<p>****: Yes, Mr; Levi.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: And how many of these precious prototypes did
we manage to bring with us?</p>
<p><strong>female assistant</strong>: Twenty-one, Mr. Levi. Levi’s face
clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the following exchange.</p>
<p>****: Twenty-one? I thought we had an even two dozen.</p>
<p><strong>male assistant</strong>: The first three we opened were…
unhealthy.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: Really? Any chance that some of the
others…?</p>
<p><strong>female assistant</strong>: We think we’re clean.</p>
<p>****: God-damn better be. Levi turns back to his audience, radiant
once more.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: We have twenty-one prototype MetaFlesh
Game-Pods, and that means that for our first wave test enclave we need
twenty-one volunteers who will port in these slave units with the
Game-Pod Goddess herself… Levi doesn’t need to finish his pitch. Every
hand is waving in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, “Me, me, oh
God, please, let it be me!” Geller can only stand by modestly and beam
at the intensity of the small crowd’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Hold it. Not so fast. In response, the fan
thrusts a card at him. Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card
which includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats his
name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul into the depths
of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl case slung over his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: Oh, god. I hope I’m not too late. Did I
miss the port-in?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It’s just the first wave. You can be part of
the second wave. OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms up. I have to scan you.
Metal and heavy synthetics can’t come in.</p>
<p>****: A weapons check?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: More for recording devices. Lotta money
invested in these games. Industrial espionage happens. What’s in this
case?</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: I brought my game-pod. It’s got original
Marway tissue architecture. It’s kind of obsolete but I was hoping,…</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: even though I couldn’t afford the Antenna
Fifteen upgrade, I figured out a method of virtual porting that I
thought might… Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens
the zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid, rubbery
version of the new MetaFlesh pods.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: You won’t need it tonight. Everything’s
provided for. Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost
faints.</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: Migod! Is that who I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>.pikul</strong>: Yeah, that’s her. She’s something, isn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: But why would a star like her come to a
product seminar in a little one-horse town like this?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: This is where the real people live, Joel. Her
real fans, like you.</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: Yeah, well, you said it. Just like me.
Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to join the
spectators who will form the second wave and re- locks the door. On the
dais, in the center of the circle of linked game players, Levi nods at
Geller.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: Everything’s in order. Are you ready,
Allegra?</p>
<p>****: Sure. This is my favourite part.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’m ready to download eXistenZ by Antenna
Research into you all now. I’m warning you, it’s going to be a wild
ride, but don’t panic no matter what happens. I’ll see you all back here
in no time at all. Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous,
uncertain, but it’s too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like
protuberance on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their
eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have suddenly been
contacted by the spirit world. The pods in their laps begin a rhythmic,
peristaltic rippling. At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to
Levi.</p>
<p>****: She seems to be very shy. It never occurred to me that a big
star would be shy.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: She spends most of her time alone in a room
designing her games. I think she’d like it best if she never had to show
them to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Really? She doesn’t enjoy all the
adulation?</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: She hates having to port in with her fans.
It’s too intimate.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Then why does she do it?</p>
<p>****: We make her do it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: By “we” you mean, the game company, Antenna
Research?</p>
<p><strong>levi ’</strong>: That’s what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>****: Are you with us or did an independent security company send
you?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Me? Oh, I’m with your own management training
program. I want to end up in marketing and public relations. The only
thing I know about security is how to switch this thing on.</p>
<p>****: Well, for example, we’ve spent a fortune developing eXistenZ,
but we all know it’s a risky project. She might have to make changes.
It’s the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem.</p>
<p>****: A problem with her new game?</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: eXistenZ is a lot more than a game.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, right, it’s a game system. I heard
that.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: And we’re worried that it’s too intellectual,
too complex, too weird, too artsy. That argument ; never bothers her
until she faces her fans. She hates to be rejected in the flesh, so we
make her come out sometimes to take the heat.</p>
<p>****: 4 I’ve heard that she’s very sensitive. A strange, choral
humming begins to fill the church. Pikul and Levi turn their attention
to the dais, where the fans rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods
in their laps.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What are they doing?</p>
<p>****: It’s the new Antenna Research theme song. We thought this would
be a good way to launch it. Everybody who plays eXistenZ is going to be
very familiar with that tune. Haltingly, but gamely, Pikul tries to hum
along.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Catchy. Levi helps him out, and soon the
whole room is humming along happily, warmed by the Antenna Research
corporate theme song. The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter,
who, at the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around in
the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder. In the case, we watch as
Dichter tears open his obsolete game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a
pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a
small mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is the
trigger. Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few
gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the dais. Pikul
is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who’s still blissed out
and humming, then launches himself awkwardly through the crowd. Now in
the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way towards the blissfully
unsuspecting Geller, raising his weapon as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: Death to eXistenZ! Death to Antenna
Research! Death to the demoness Allegra Geller!</p>
<p>****: No! Don’t do it! Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through
the small crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter hurriedly
raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller. The first shot hits her
in the shoulder and spins her off her chair, which collapses over her
and takes the second bullet on its seat rim. The circle of players on
the dais moans as one, swoons and jostles: they are all feeling the
neural surge of Geller’s traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from
under her folding chair, Geller’s eyes are wide with fear and confusion.
She clutches her shoulder without being aware of it. Blood seeps in
between her fingers Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the
platform to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the players
nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately goes spastic,
screaming and twitching and dropping to the ground and writhing. Many of
them are clutching their shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy
pain transmitting through their UmbyCords. Pikul manages to tackle
Dichter, then starts whacking at him with the security wand. Dichter
twists around and raises his weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off
in terror. But before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants
produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty their clips
into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to squeeze off one last shot
at the approaching Jevi, hitting him squarely in the chest. Levi goes
down and is lost amongst the jostling feet. The watching fans pile onto
the dais and begin to help the players unplug from the game-pods which
are obviously causing them distress. Three of the players attack the
dying Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at whatever
part of him they can find in the confused mass of bodies. in the
turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the stamping, sliding
feet, he finds himself lying across the stricken-Levi. Levi clutches
Pikul desperately.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: Get her out of here! Save her! There might be
more of them! Go on!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Me? Me take her?</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: We have enemies in our own house. Trust no
one. Trust no one… The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and
promptly trips over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his
knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in his hand.
Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified. He turns back to Levi, but
Levi’s eyes are rolling back as he loses consciousness. The two
assistants are making their way towards them through the shoving,
shuffling throng, guns cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the
bone gun into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly looking
around for Geller. She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap
only a few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul
unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a lot of
clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one arm, screams at
them.</p>
<p>****: She’s coming with me! I’m responsible for her! She’s supposed
to come with me! To his surprise, Geller laughs a dazed, hearty
laugh.</p>
<p>****: Am I? With you?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, you’re coming with me. Pikul pulls her
to her feet, but she immediately dives back to the floor to find her
game-pod and UmbyCord.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I can’t lose this! I can’t lose this! She
finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit flattened on one
side but in one piece. She grabs the game- pod and its UmbyCord and
stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod case which has been knocked to the
edge of the dais. As she clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and
hauls her through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded
dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They head for the
door, fighting everybody off as though they might be lethal. As they
leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six fans, shrieking like
monkeys, still stomping and kicking the body of Dichter viciously,
hysterically, while Levi’s two assistants carry him to the safety of the
church’s apse.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Let’s take my limo.</p>
<p>****: No, no!</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Why no?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I don’t trust the driver!</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You drive, idiot!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What’s the commotion, Miss Geller? Say, are
you all right? What’s goin’ on in there?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We need this vehicle, and we need it without
you. But with the keys.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I can’t do that. I can’t abandon my
vehicle. Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul’s pocket.
She points it at Frances.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Get out, Frances. You can say you were
hijacked.</p>
<p>****: It’ll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this
seat. Geller fires two shots. One rips a hole in Frances’s headrest.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You have to push the shift lever down to
get it into reverse.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Thanks, Frances. They drive off down the
country road, leaving Frances in the dust.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I normally like the countryside, don’t you?
Normally, the country is relaxing and calm.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Only if you don’t really know what’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: There is great stress and anger and violence
in the countryside. Thousands of life forms all screaming ME ME ME and
trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms. It’s
terrifying and exhausting.</p>
<p>****: Well, I like the countryside.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: That’s good, `cause you might end up
spending a lot of time here.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I might?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Sure. If you go back home to the city,
they’ll probably be waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: They?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Yeah. My assassins. They’d want to have a
little talk with you about where I am.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I was hoping that was just one crazy guy.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Did you hear the way he screamed at me? He
wasn’t alone.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Everybody likes a conspiracy. It’s more
satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing. Geller goes
silent.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Well, what are we going to do out here? Do
you know your way around? You know any country people?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Not country people. Games people. The
countryside’s full of games development people, project co- ordinators,
little factories - you name it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: That’s weird. I never knew that.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: The city’s full of bad microwaves, bad
thermals, bad electro-optics. You can’t shield from it anymore. You
can’t get true readings. The whole industry moved out of the city years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: So you know your way around. We can hide
out.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Maybe. But it seems I have some enemies I
didn’t know I had. “Death to Allegra Geller.” How’d you like to hear
somebody with a gun screaming, “Death to Ted Pikul”?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Wow. Hey, how’d you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re labelled.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p>****: How did you know how to fire that, gun? I’ve never seen
anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It has a trigger. I pulled it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Can I see it?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Later. I think I’m gonna use it in my next
game. If there ever is a next game. Pikul glances at her. He hits a
pothole and she bounces around in her seat, exposing her far shoulder to
him. Her shirt is soaked with blood.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Migod, you’re bleeding. I forgot you got hit.
There is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in Pikul’s breast pocket.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It’s my pink-fone. I’m not sure I should
answer it.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Answer it. Pikul pulls the pink-fone - it’s
soft surgical plastic, palm-sized - out of his pocket. When he squeezes
it open, a diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it.</p>
<p>****: Ted Pikul.</p>
<p>****: What happened? Some fan went crazy and started shooting up the
place. I don’t know why. He was just nuts. Allegra Geller? She’s with
me. We’re OK. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>****: You’re kidding me. You’re kidding me! God. 1 can’t believe it.
I can’t do that. No, how can I do that? Well, I’m not really sure where
we are because… Geller grabs the pink-tone from him. She fumbles around
with it, trying to find the power button. She accidentally summons up a
read-out, which she pauses to look at. What she sees makes her glance up
at Pikul.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What? Can I have my pink-tone back? Geller
finds the power button and pushes it. The pink inner light flutters out.
She unceremoniously throws the pink-tone out the window. It lands in a
rain ditch full of frogs.</p>
<p>****: What did you do that for? That was our lifeline to
civilization.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: That was a rangefinder. As long as you have
that, they know where you are.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: They? You mean head office?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I mean anybody.</p>
<p>****: I heard what Levi said to you. He said, “We have enemies in our
own house.” He said it as he was dying.</p>
<p>****: I don’t think he died. I mean, do you? I think he maybe
fainted… Maybe he went unconscious…</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: That was Alex Kindred, head of publicity and
marketing, at Antenna HQ…</p>
<p>****: .on that very expensive pink- fone you threw away.</p>
<p>****: He said that some bizarre fanatical group called the Anti-
eXistenZialists has put a price of 5 million dollars on your head,
payable to anybody who kills you. It’s been released to all the media
now. Everybody knows about it.</p>
<p>****: Anti-existentialists?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: No. Anti-eXistenZialists. Capital X, capital
Z. They somehow found out about eXistenZ and they want to kill you for
creating it. They say that the eXistenZ game system will “finally
destroy reality”, or something totally nuts like that.</p>
<p>****: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It makes sense to you? You’re not
suprised?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I hear things. It’s hard to surprise me.</p>
<p>****: And what else?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Kindred said that I’m your bodyguard and the
company is holding me totally responsible for your safety.</p>
<p>****: Pikul, why don’t you have a gun with you?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re not armed. They told me you were my
security but you have no weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Who told you that? I’m just a marketing
trainee. My clinic master thought I’d learn something about marketing if
I moonlighted as a security guard on one of your test previews.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Fuck. I’m marked for death and they send me
on the road with a PR nerd.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Jesus! Marked for death!</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Don’t sweat it, Pikul. I’ll handle it. We
just have to disappear for a while. And right now, we have to stop.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: We do? Why?</p>
<p>****: So we can have an intimate moment together.</p>
<p>****: C’mon. If you’re gonna do it, do it.</p>
<p><strong>ok, ok.</strong>: He grits his teeth and digs in with a bit
more gusto. Something yellow and white, like a kernel of corn, flips out
of her wound and onto the road’s shredding asphalt. Pikul feels around
for it, finds it, holds it up to the light.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I got it. Wow. Did somebody bite you?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What I just dug out of you. It’s a tooth. A
human tooth. Pikul holds the tooth out to her, but she just glances at
it, then rummages around in her MetaFlesh game-pod bag.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Lemme see that weirdo pistol. Geller pulls
the strange weapon out of the bag. After a moment of study, she expertly
pops the magazine out of the grip. The gristly magazine is packed with
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Yep. The bullets are human teeth. Look -
this one’s got a cavity.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: That thing was designed to get past any kind
of metal or synthetics detector. It’s all flesh and bone.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I suppose the smaller caliber pistols would
have to fire baby teeth. The tooth fairy could go I into the arms
business.</p>
<p>****: That guy really came there tonight just to kill you.</p>
<p>****: Amazing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: The whole gamesworld is in a kind of
trance.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yes. I remember you said that at the
church.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: People are prepared to accept so little.
They’re in a’cage formed out of their own limited</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: expectations. They have no idea what amazing
things could be theirs.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Where were you just now? What were you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I was wandering through eXistenZ - the new
system, I mean. I like it in there. Of course, without another player
you’re only a tourist. It’s frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Why won’t you let me contact Antenna? They’ve
got to be going crazy, wondering what’s happened to you. I mean, it’s
not like we’ve done something wrong. We just ran because we didn’t know
how many of them there were, right? I think we owe it to Antenna to let
them know you’re all right, to get them to send somebody to help you who
knows what he’s doing… And besides, I can’t… I can’t just keep doing
this, whatever it is, you know, forever, not having any idea when it’s
going to be… Geller gets up and goes over to Pikul. She pulls up his
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Where’s your bioport? Don’t tell me you were
never fitted. I can’t believe it. Pikul shrugs his shirt back down,
starts tucking it in.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: No, I was never fitted with a bioport. What
do you care?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re hoping to get into the biz and you’ve
never played one of my games. You’ve never played any game. That means
you have no idea</p>
<p>****: My clinic master told me I don’t need to play a game to know
how to sell it.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Bullshit. Posturing. You don’t play my
games, you don’t work for Antenna Research, I’ll make sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Look, I’ve been dying to play your games. But
I have this - phobia about having my body penetrated - surgically. You
know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’m not so sure I do.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Getting a bioport fitted… I dunno. I can’t do
it. It’s too freaky. Makes my skin crawl.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: God, c’mon. They just pop your spine with a
little hydro-gun. Shoot the port-plug into it. They do it at malls, like
getting your ears pierced.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, sure. With only an infinitesimal chance
of permanent spinal paralysis. I’ve read all about it.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It’s your chosen profession, geek. She
pauses, then moves very close to him. She breathes her words slowly,
intimately, into his ear.</p>
<p>****: There’s an intimacy involved in playing eXistenZ that is beyond
description. It has to be experienced. And frankly, the two-player
version is the most exquisitely intense. Wouldn’t you like to play with
me?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Well, yeah, of course, but… Let me, uh, let
me call Antenna…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: They wouldn’t want to talk to you if they
knew you had never had a bioport installed. It’s company policy, you
know. They want you to be passionate about your work.</p>
<p>****: Besides, once you’re ported, there’s no end to the games you
can play.</p>
<p>****: You can’t seriously want to play games now. Not here. Not while
we’re being hunted down by crazy people. _ Geller sighs, then switches
into her explaining-the-facts- of-life-to-a-child mode.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: My baby here took a huge hit in the church,
Pikul. You see how she’s quivering? Pikul takes a look. The pod is, in
fact, quivering like a terrified hamster.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It… she, yes, she’s quivering.</p>
<p>****: When those UmbyCords got ripped out of her in the church,
ripped</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: out just as the game architecture was being
downloaded from her to all those slave pods… that’s a very vulnerable
time for her. She could be crying out for help right here, right
now.</p>
<p>****: The only way I can tell if everything’s OK - the game’s not
been contaminated, the pod, my baby, is not about to be crippled for
life because of my negligence - the only way is to play eXistenZ with
somebody friendly. Are you friendly, or are you not?</p>
<p>****: Sure, all right.</p>
<p>****: Let’s do it… let’s do it now. Let me see. To get an illegal,
unregistered bioport installed at about midnight - we just drive up to
your local country gas station, right?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Anything else I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Well, Gas, you could check your
bioport-plugs.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: The what? The sparkplugs?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You heard me. My friend here has a bioport
problem.</p>
<p>****: A bioport, now, that’s a sort of a hole in your spine, isn’t
it? Lotta assholes `round here, but that’s generally it. I don’t know
why you’d be talking to me about that, lady. Geller smiles a knowing
smile.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Sure you do. Gas looks at her closely for
the first time. His eyes widen in disbelief. He pulls a greasy wallet
out of his overalls and flips out the card holders. Amongst various
family photos, hot rod photos, fishing photos, is a photo of Allegra
Geller clipped from a glossy magazine. Under the photo is the legend
“Genius In A Game-Pod”. Gas takes her hand in his and kisses it.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Allegra Geller. You changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What was your life like before?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Before?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Before it was changed by Allegra Geller.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: I operated a gas station.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But you still operate a gas station, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Only on the most pathetic level of reality.
Geller’s work liberated me.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Liberated?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Did you ever play her game ArtGod? One word,
capital A, capital G?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I don’t have a bioport, remember?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: “Thou, the player of the game, art God.” Very
spiritual. Funny, too. God, the artist. The mechanic. Funny. Gas zips up
his fresh overalls.</p>
<p>****: Those are sterile, are they?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Not to worry. They way they set things up, you
could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an
infection.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Then why the clean overalls?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: It’s a mental thing. Helps me focus. The one
thing you don’t want to do is miss with the stud- finder.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p>****: God, the mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>z’r</strong>: Gas slides open a drawer of his red metal
mechanic’s rolling toolbox and pulls out a greasy device that looks like
a carbon-fibre voltage meter.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: We call this thing a stud-finder.’ It locates
the spot on your spine where the x intersects with the y. We don’t want
to be even a micron out of whack. That’s when you get troubles. It’s a
little radar/sonar/laser thingee. Marks you with a special range-finding
dye.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Never say dye.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Lift up your shirt and turn around.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: See, that didn’t hurt, did it?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I didn’t expect that to hurt. I expect the
next part to hurt. Gas pulls the bioport insertion gun out of another
drawer, this time a locked wooden one bolted under his metal-topped work
bench. It is a scary thing, like a hydraulic jack designed by Giger,
only smaller.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I expect will hurt.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: I’ve never crippled anyone yet.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: How many have you done?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Three. Well, you’ll be the third.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: What’s going on, Gas?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Hell, he’s acting like I’m attackin’ him.
People usually pay me.to do this, you know.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah. All two of them. As you can see, I’ve
decided not to have a bioport installed.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: This is it, you see. This is the cage I was
talking about, the cage of your own making which keeps you trapped and
pacing about in the smallest possible space forever. Break out of your
cage, Pikul. Break out now.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: That swelling doesn’t last for long.
Tomorrow, you won’t even notice it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I love it. Great. Pikul tries to get up from
the wingback chair and promptly collapses into the arms of Geller and
Gas.</p>
<p>****: What’s going on? I can’t walk!</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: The procedure comes with its own epidural, just
like when you have a baby. Kinda like instant paralysis from the waist
down? That’s why it didn’t hurt you. It’ll wear off in about twenty
minutes. As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair, Gas
almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in one hand. He
leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul notices blood and flecks
of skin on Gas’s work gloves.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: You’re looking more like a butcher than a
mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Things do get kinda confused these days, don’t
they? I’m gonna go wash up. You two make yourselves at home. Gas strides
off towards the washroom with an air of great satisfaction. Geller eases
her game-pod out of its case and starts to attach its two-player,
Y-shaped UmbyCord to it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We don’t have to wait for the swelling to go
down.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: You’re going to port into me? While I’m
paralysed?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You wanted to play my game, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, I did, and I do, but… Here? Now?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It’s an instant-on world, isn’t it? She
lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport. It already looks a bit
less angry than it did before. Geller caresses it, prods it, plays with
it. Then she takes out a little bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and
into the port.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What’s that for? It feels cold.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: New ports are sometimes a bit tight.
Wouldn’t want to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: How come bioports don’t get infected? I mean,
they open right into your body…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Listen to what you’re saying, Pikul. Don’t
be ludicrous.</p>
<p>****: Don’t you think you could call me Ted?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Maybe afterwards. Geller gently works her
UmbyJack into Pikul’s bioport. She locks her eyes onto his, then
squeezes her game-pod’s ON teat. Instantly, her pod convulses and begins
to flash and spark and crackle. White electronic smoke seeps from its
crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its pores. Geller
leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her UmbyJack out of Pikul’s
spine. He can’t feel it, but the furious force of her move twists him in
his chair.</p>
<p>****: Shit, Pikul! I can’t believe this! I trusted you and you blew
my pod! You must have neural- surged!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p>****: I jacked you into my pod and you obviously panicked. Now it’s
totally fucked! This is a disaster!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I.. I was nervous, but I didn’t panic.</p>
<p>****: I was forced to trust you and you panicked and you
neural-surged, and you blew my pod.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: You can get a new pod…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Pikul, in this pod is the only, the original
version of eXistenZ, an entire game system that cost thirty-eight
million to develop, not including pre-release marketing costs. And I’m
locked outside of my own game! I can’t get it out, or me in!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Are you serious? This is the only version
that exists?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Security is everything these days. It’s the
only one and its stuck inside and it’s your fault. Geller uses her
sleeve to clean the drool off the pod with tragic gentleness, as though
it were an injured child.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’ve devoted my five most passionate years
to this strange little creature. And I’ve never regretted it, Pikul,
because I knew that it was the only thing that could give my life any
meaning…</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But why is it my fault? I’m telling you, I
didn’t, I did not neural-surge. I didn’t. I didn’t feel any surging. Gas
strolls into the garage, still wearing his work gloves, which now hold
an agricultural-looking shotgun. It is levelled at Geller.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: It isn’t your fault. It’s my fault. Pikul looks
at Gas in disbelief. His feet begin to writhe in circles, but he still
can’t get out of the chair; Geller backs away from Gas, clutching her
pod protectively.</p>
<p>****: Oh, no, Gas, not you.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: I wouldn’t try to use that bioport again, `cept
maybe for a toaster or something.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: You’re worth a lot of money. If you’re
dead.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: You know what I’m talking about. It’s all over
the countryside. Five million for her dead body. No questions asked.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But, but… she changed your life.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Yup. And now I’m gonna change hers.</p>
<p>****: But wait… Why did you install a bad port into me?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Seems there’s a big bonus for killing Allegra
Geller’s latest game, or whatever it is. I think I just did that, didn’t
I? Geller decides to try another tack. She stops backing away and begins
to slowly approach Gas.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: But can you kill a person? Can you do that,
Gas? Can you kill me? Hide my body. Contact the crazies. Trust them to
pay up. Hand over my now-decaying, fucking grotesque corpse. Really
expect them to hand over 5 mil cash? Don’t you ever go to the fuckin’
movies?</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: I like your script. I want to be in it. Gas
cocks his shotgun. He’s really going to do it. Except that Pikul shoots
him right in the mastoid bone, just behind the ear, with the bioport
insertion gun. The back of Gas’s skull shatters and he goes down hard.
Pikul drops the gun and launches himself out of his chair. He falls to
his knees beside Gas’s body.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Oh, God, I think he’s dead. I thought I could
just distract him.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You did distract him. Plug your toaster into
that hole, corpse!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: He wanted to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: That’s two people in one day who wanted to
actually kill you.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’ve never been more popular.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Allegra, we need help.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re right. I’ve got to get this pod
fixed.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: We’re going skiing?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Nothing in the countryside is what it seems.
It’s all appearance versus reality, and the reality here is something
unique.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Look at that huge bug. It’s got two
heads.</p>
<p><strong>geller ’</strong>: They breed them here. They’re not supposed
to get away. They get out and walk towards the clubhouse.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What if somebody comes up here and really
wants to ski?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Nobody actually physically skis any more,
Pikul. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I’ve watched some ski shows. Downhill racing,
Austrian Alps.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: My darling Allegra. I am so pleased to see
you here. They embrace.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Kiri Vinokur, this is my bodyguard, Ted
Pikul.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Hello, yes, I heard the ridiculous story
about this fatwa against you. The company is desperately trying to find
you. Is it really serious? Are you in danger?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: If I’m her bodyguard, then she’s in grave
danger.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: There have been a couple of attempts on my
life already.</p>
<p>****: No! That’s unbearable. The company must stop this. They owe you
every kind of protection.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I don’t know if they can do anything about
it. It seems to be open season on me.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur ,</strong>: Well, you will be safe here, I can assure
you of that. I will contact Antenna right away and have them send some
people to come and collect you.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Kiri, no, don’t. You mustn’t let anybody
know we’re here unless you have to. I can’t be sure that Antenna is
completely safe for me.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: I understand. Yes. The company draws many
eccentric people into its fold. You can hide in one of the guest
chalets. As long as you like. I will make sure you get fresh towels…
Geller pats her game-pod case.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: .and make sure I don’t lose everything I
have in here.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: What did you port into?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Pikul’s bioport.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Really? That’s what did all the damage?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It was a flawed installation - my first. It…
it neural-surged. Allegra says you can fix it.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: It fried some very expensive nerve boards.
See? Here. These are kaput. It’s a complex thing.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Nerve boards?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: We use the nervous systems of
specially-bred insects to create the electronic circuits on our
motherboards.</p>
<p>****: Only Antenna Research has it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Wow. And where do the batteries go?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: He’s not kidding. He’s a total PR nerd.</p>
<p>****: It ports into you, and you are the power source. Your body,
your nervous system. Your energy. When you get tired, run down, it won’t
run properly.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Landry here will finish up the pod-work.
Meanwhile…</p>
<p>****: Let’s get that nasty bioport out of you and get a nice, fresh
one in there. We have guest chalets out back. You’re both welcome to
stay. Now where did I put my bioport-plug puller..? Here it is. Vinokur
hauls out a device that looks like a pair of spring- loaded fire
tongs.</p>
<p>****: Lie down on that couch and pull up your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It hurts. I think it’s infected.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It’s not infected. It’s just excited. It
wants action. She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y-
shaped UmbyCord, but he twists away from her.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But I really don’t think that I want action.
Me, I mean. The bearer of the excited bioport. What I want is… not now.
Not here. I feel too… too exposed. Geller sighs, then switches into her
explaining-the-facts- of-life-to-a-child mode. They are both aware that
they are replaying an earlier moment.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: My baby here has now taken three major hits,
one in the church, one in the gas station, and one on the operating
table. The only way I can tell if everything’s OK - the game’s not been
contaminated, the pod’s not fucked - is to play eXistenZ with somebody
friendly. Are you friendly, or are you not? Pikul swallows nervously,
then turns his back to Geller so that she can port in.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: You’re telling me this thing will run off my
body’s energy?</p>
<p>****: That’s how they work. See? You’re hummin’ along already. Sure
enough, he is. Geller deftly twists the second jack into her own bioport
and takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: All right. eXistenZ. Only from Antenna. Here
we go.</p>
<p>****: You’ve got a bit of an unfair advantage, don’t you? How can I
possibly compete with the designer of the system?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You could beat the guy who invented poker,
couldn’t you? Geller flicks the game-pod nipple, and the chalet begins
to melt away around them.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: That was beautiful. I feel… just like me. Is
that kind of transition normal, a kind of smooth dissolve from place to
place?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Depends on the style of the game. You can
get jagged, brutal cuts, slow fades, shimmering little morphs…</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: This is amazing. I had no idea. We… we’re
still ourselves, but we’re in the game. Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It’s basically a game store I used to hang
out in as a kid.</p>
<p>****: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We’re ported into a game-pod together,
remember? eXistenZ has complete access to both our central nervous
systems. Its game architecture will be based on our memories, our
anxieties, our preoccupations…</p>
<p>****: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You keep saying that. Look at this. Games
I’ve never heard of. Biological Father. Hit By A Car. Viral Ecstasy.
Chinese Restaurant. In Viral Ecstasy, you are a virus invading a
specific human body. You create ingenious viral strategies to cope with
the efforts of the body’s immune system to destroy you…”</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Wait a minute. That reminds me. What
precisely is the goal of the game we’re playing now? I mean, the rules,
the objective… Nobody’s ever really said anything about what you have to
do in eXistenZ.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: The beauty of eXistenZ is that it changes
every time you play it. It adapts to the individuals who are actually
playing it. The result is that you have to play the game to find out why
you’re playing the game.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But that’s kind of cheating, isn’t it? Not to
say confusing.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Not at all. It’s a much more organic
approach to gaming than classic, arbitrary, rule- dominated games. It’s
the future, Pikul. You’ll see how natural it feels.</p>
<p>****: Look at this. Could this be the future too? Ever see anything
like this before? They are looking at a game-pod in a gel-pak that is
even weirder than a tissue-pod. It has a logo and a name -</p>
<p><strong>cortical systematics.</strong>: Suddenly, a hand reaches into
the frame and takes the pak away, puts it neatly back on the rack. Pikul
and Geller look up at a man in his early fifties, graying, thinning
hair, beefy, generally harried and pugnacious air. The man is Dorsey
Nader.</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: These are delicate. You have to be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yes. I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: Cortical Systematics is the latest and the
hottest. Not just a new game, but a new system.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Will it work with an industry standard
bioport?</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: I haven’t seen you two before, have I? This
is my place. Haimische, isn’t it? Funky?</p>
<p><strong>pikui,</strong>: We’re new in town.</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: Welcome to Dorsey Nader’s Game Emporium. I’m
Dorsey Nader. Is there anything I can help you with?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We’re just looking.</p>
<p>****: I have what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: Follow me. Nader turns his back on them and
walks to the back of the store. He stops at a warped and dirty door,
turns, beckons to them urgently, trying not to be noticed by the
preoccupied patrons. As Pikul and Geller follow Nader through the door,
they do not escape the notice of the sour-faced young cashier, who
writes something down hurriedly on a pad with an air of vengeful
self-importance.</p>
<p>****: Who sent you?</p>
<p>****: It’s none of your businesz who sent us. We’re here, and that’s
all that matters.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Oh God, what happened? I didn’t mean to say
that!</p>
<p>****: It’s your character who said it. It’s a kind of schizophrenic
feeling, isn’t it? But you’ll get used to it. There are things that have
to be said to advance the plot and establish the characters, and those
things get said whether you want to say them or not. Don’t fight it.
Just go with it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But should you be saying that in front of
him? Nader?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Look at him. Pikul does. Nader doesn’t seem
to have heard him. In fact, he doesn’t respond at all other than to hum
the Antenna Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively,
caught in a small behavioural loop. Geller chuckles at Pikul’s
confusion.</p>
<p>****: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: He’s gone into a game loop, he’s locked up,
and he won’t come out of it until you give him a proper game line of
dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: This is tricky.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Start by repeating your last line. Include
his name so he knows you’re talking.to him.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: We’re here, Dorsey Nader, and that’s all that
matters. Nader immediately comes out of his loop. He chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: You’re right. That is all tha matters. Pikul
smiles, delighted. Now he takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, relaxes.
The line comes.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Well, Nader, you said you had what we want.
We’re waiting.</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: You’re going to need these micro- pods to
download your new identities. I assume that you both have had those
industry standard bioports you mentioned installed.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Yes, of course, that’s right. We both have
bioports. Here she pauses, looks at Pikul.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We do, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I assumed we did. I mean, here. In the game.
Of course, we might not.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We’d better check. While Nader goes into
game lock-up, Geller lifts up her shirt. Pikul takes a look. Her bioport
is there, although slightly rougher, puckered, more organic than in
non-game life.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, it’s there. Looks a little different,
but it’s there. Geller grabs Pikul’s shirt and lifts it. His is there
too.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I see what you mean.</p>
<p>****: Yes, we both have bioports.</p>
<p>****: Good. Port in and this’ll tell you all you need to know for
now. Pikul and Geller examine the pak, which bears the Cortical
Systematics name and logo. It seems to be a miniature version of their
real-life game-pod.</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: I’m going to leave while you finish up here.
It wouldn’t be good for us all to be seen together. Nader gets up to
leave, pauses at the door.</p>
<p><strong>nader</strong>: Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. Nader
chuckles a very theatrical chuckle, then leaves.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I assume that Nader is our entry point into
the game.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Yeah. Kinda disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Nader?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Yeah. Not a very well-drawn character. And
his dialogue was just so-so.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>****: Do we blame ourselves for that? The bad dialogue? Or would it
be bad no matter who was ported in?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: The game engine is just getting used to us.
It’ll get more daring once it warms up.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: OK. The pods are so small they plug directly
into the bioport. Geller delicately twists the end of the micro-pod into
Pikul’s bioport. The micro-pod changes colour, pulses, ripples, and then
slowly flows and wriggles its way into Pikul’s bioport until it has
completely disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: God!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: The whole pod just disappeared into your
back.</p>
<p>****: It disappeared into my back?! It… it’s in my spine? It’s
winding its way around my spinal cord?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Don’t panic, it’s just a game. Do you feel
anything yet?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: No, I don’t. Not a thing. I don’t feel a
thing. Uh, do you want me to do you? They change positions. Pikul ports
in the micro-pod and it duly crawls its way into Geller’s bioport.
Tenderly, as though kissing a cut to make it better, Pikul kisses her
back, low near her bioport. Geller whirls around with sudden anger.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p>****: That wasn’t me. That was my game character. I wouldn’t have
done that. Not here, anyway. She pauses, then kisses him on the mouth,
hard.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re right. Our characters are obviously
supposed to jump on each other. Probably to create emotional tension
when danger happens. No use fighting it.</p>
<p>****: What about our new identities? Do you feel yours yet?</p>
<p>****: They’ll take care of themselves.</p>
<p>****: I’m very worried about my body. Geller stops, sits up.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Your what?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I mean, where are our real bodies? Are they
all right? Are they hungry? What if there’s danger?</p>
<p>****: They’re just where we left them, sitting quietly, eyes closed.
Just like meditating.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. I feel really vulnerable. Disembodied.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Don’t sweat it. All your senses are still
operating. You’ll pop right out of the game if there’s a problem. They
begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks and cartons of
replacement UmbyCords. And then the game store melts away around
them.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Tryin’ to remember who you are? Pikul snaps
his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking worker sitting next to
him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he twists his own card around, comically
bunching up his work shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY
NOURISH.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Hey, it works! I must be Yevgeny Nourish!
Nourish leans over to squint at Pikul’s name tag.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: And you… you are new to the Trout Farm.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yes. I… I’m… very new. Did you say trout
farm?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: You know - raise baby trout from eggs and
then stock the rivers with them.</p>
<p>****: Entire place used to be a trout farm. Seems like most
everything used to be something else, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: I You might be new but you seem to know
what you’re doing.</p>
<p>****: It surprises me more than it surprises you. Nourish moves back
to the insect motherboard that he has been working on, then leans over
again exactly as he did the first time. It has the effect of an instant
replay, but not in slow-motion.</p>
<p>****: You might be new but you seem to know what you’re doing. Pikul
realizes he hasn’t given the right answer. He now just lets it come
without thinking.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I, ah… I’ve been trained by the very best.
Nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate furtiveness.</p>
<p>****: So have I. Where do you plan to have lunch?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I’m new here. I have no plans for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>nourish 11</strong>: I suggest the Chinese restaurant in the
forest. Everybody knows where it is. Just ask.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Won’t you be going there too?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: I have other plans for lunch. But I do
suggest that you order the special. And don’t take no for an answer.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: All right, I’ll do that. Nourish turns back
to his task and begins to work away as though Pikul didn’t exist. Pikul
takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon preoccupied with
testing the board’s circuits by porting it into a test UmbyCord that
uncoils from the center of the bench. His strange reverie, watching
himself work on auto- pilot at this bizarre task, is soon interrupted by
a worker pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels. The worker
parks the cart behind Pikul and taps him on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Larry?</p>
<p>****: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: They need this in the back room. They asked
for you. The worker shuffles off, leaving the cart behind him. Pikul
turns to Nourish.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p>****: It means that they want you in the back room. They need more
insect boards for the pod assembly bays.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Should I just get up and go there?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Yeah. I’ll take care of your incoming
boards. Pikul gets up to go. Nourish grabs him by the arm and whispers
intensely.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Remember. The Chinese restaurant for
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I order the special.</p>
<p><strong>geller,</strong>: I saw you make contact, Larry Ashen. What
did the guy on the .l assembly line say to you? Pikul’s expression shows
that there is a return game line welling up in his mouth, tickling his
tongue, perhaps. Perversely, he fights it, but it comes out anyway.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: He told me where to have lunch.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: We have nice sea bass today. Shall I bring
it for everyone? Pikul and Geller exchange a look. Pikul shrugs OK.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: We want the special. The waiter looks
stunned. The others at their table look distressed. The waiter seems to
lock up, almost freeze- framed.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Did you hear me, Chinese waiter?</p>
<p>****: We want the special. The waiter unfreezes, smiles grimly.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: The special is for special occasions. I
cannot give you the special.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But this is a special occasion. It’s… Pikul
pauses, waiting for the proper game line to materialize in his mouth.
Finally, it does. He gestures towards Geller.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It’s her birthday. The waiter locks up for a
moment, then unfreezes.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: A birthday is a special occasion. I will
therefore bring the special for everybody. The waiter walks away. The
others at the table get up and move away, drift over to other tables
with occasional furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I guess the special isn’t very popular.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But you know, really, don’t you? You don’t
have to guess. I mean, it’s your game, your little universe.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I don’t know. You have to understand that,
to understand what we’ve really created with eXistenZ.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: You’re telling me, for example, that you
don’t know what the special is?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Correct. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Or why we ordered it.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We ordered it because another game character
told you to. That’s a clue we can’t ignore. But that’s just basic games
playing.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I want to put the game on pause. Geller just
looks at him, puzzled. Pikul panics.</p>
<p>****: The game can be paused, can’t it? I mean, all games can be
paused, right?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Sure, yeah, but why? What’s wrong? Aren’t
you dying to see what’s special about the special?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I’m feeling a little disconnected from my
real life. I’m kind of losing touch with the texture of it, you know
what I mean? I mean, I actually think there’s an element of psychosis
involved here. I mean, I don’t know where my body really is, or where
reality is, what I’ve actually done, or not done.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: That’s a great sign. It means your nervous
system is fully engaging with the game architecture. The game is a lot
more fun when it starts to feel realer than real.</p>
<p>****: Yeah. Pikul stands up and screams at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>****: eXistenZ is paused! The Chinese restaurant melts away.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Did I do that? I guess I did.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: So how does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Your real life. The one you came back
for.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Just sitting here, it feels completely
unreal. I’m sure you knew that would happen.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re stuck now, aren’t you? You want to go
back to the Chinese restaurant because there’s nothing happening here.
We’re safe. It’s boring.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Worse than that. I’m not sure here, where we
are, is real at all. This feels like the game. And you… you’re beginning
to t1 feel a bit like a game character to me.</p>
<p>****: Did we really make love to each other?</p>
<p>****: Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It feels like we did.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Our characters did. I’m sure it would be
very different if we did.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I… I’m actually just like that in real life.
You got the real Ted Pikul there, in the stockroom of the game
store.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Well, you didn’t get the real Allegra
Geller, I can tell you that. no</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I didn’t? She kisses him gently.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: No. In real life I tend to lose control. It
can get messy.</p>
<p>****: Let’s go back. Pikul looks down at the pod. He flicks the PLAY
nipple. The room melts down around them and is replaced by the Chinese
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Special order for the birthday girl. Hope
you enjoy it very much. In the dishes are a variety of cooked reptiles,
amphibians, fish and birds, all weirdly mutated and presented in a
bizarrely beautiful fashion.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I think I’ve lost my appetite.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: A shame. Mutant creatures provide new and
previously unimagined taste sensations.</p>
<p>****: Shall I clear all this away? Geller sees that this is a crucial
game moment.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: No, it looks terrific. Thank you. We’re
happy. The waiter nods.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Very good. Enjoy. The waiter leaves. Geller
watches him go, suspicious. When she turns back to Pikul, she is shocked
to see that he has served out most of the creatures to himself and is
avidly stripping the meat off their bones.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Pikul, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I don’t know. I find this disgusting but I
can’t help myself.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Oh, good! Pikul looks up from his big bowl,
which is rapidly filling with creature parts. His fingers are’slimy and
sticky, but he doesn’t stop, his fingers working expertly on their
own.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Good? You think this is good?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Yeah. It’s a genuine game urge. It’s
something that your game character was born to do. Don’t fight it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I am fighting it, but it isn’t doing me any
good. Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone, gristle
and flesh, a grotesque Lego set. When he’s finished, he’s made a gun
very much like the one that was used in the attempted assassination in
the church.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Omigod, this looks awfully familiar. You sure
this is OK?</p>
<p>****: It should be OK. Now Pikul reaches into his mouth, pulls out a
bridge of three teeth - one of them gold-filled - and loads them into
the gristly magazine.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Do you have that bridge in real life?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Absolutely not. My teeth are perfect. Don’t
ask me how I knew this thing was in my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It probably wasn’t until you ordered the
special. He slaps the magazine into the handle, then pulls the slide
back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in the chamber.
Then with a smile, Pikul points the weapon at Geller.</p>
<p>****: Death to the demoness Allegra Geller.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: That’s not funny!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Sorry, I couldn’t resist. But you know… I do
feel the urge to kill someone here. Geller grips the edge of her bowl of
hot-and-sour soup - the handiest weapon she has.</p>
<p>****: Who?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I need to kill our waiter.</p>
<p>****: Oh, well, that makes sense.</p>
<p>****: Waiter! Waiter!</p>
<p>****: When he comes over, do it. Don’t hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But everything in this game is so realistic.
I don’t think I really could…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You won’t be able to stop. You might as well
enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: “Free will” is obviously not a big factor in
this little world of ours.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It’s like real life - there’s just enough to
make it interesting. - Pikul spots the waiter making his way across the
room towards them, a big smile on his face.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: He’s too nice. I won’t do it. The waiter
arrives at their table.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: What can I do to make your lunch more
pleasant? Pikul lifts the gun and points it at the waiter.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I found this in my soup and I’m very upset.
Pikul fires. The tooth-bullet hits the waiter in the cheekbone. A chunk
of the waiter’s cheekbone comes off and his head jerks back like a
fighter taking a stiff jab. The waiter’s sweet face instantly transforms
into a hideous, angry, snarling mask of hatred. He pulls a meat cleaver
out of his jacket. Geller immediately throws her bowl of hot-and-sour
soup into the waiter’s face. The waiter screams, then wildly wipes the
noodles and goop out of his eyes. He raises the cleaver over his head.
The waiter swings and lunges across the table, managing only to hack the
tip of the gun off. Pikul is shocked to see the gun begin to bleed. The
waiter, sprawling across the table, screams as he tries to reach Geller
with his cleaver. Pikul</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: St’s all right, just a little
misunderstanding over the check. Pay no attention and enjoy your meal.
To his surprise, the patrons actually turn back to their meals, albeit
with a certain sinister reluctance. Pikul looks around wildly.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I feel a serious game urge to get out of
here! Through the porthole in one of the pair of metal-clad kitchen
doors, Geller spots someone wearing a che’f’s hat, someone who is wildly
beckoning to them.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Through the kitchen! That way!</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Did you like the meal I prepared for
you?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yes. It was very… revealing.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: It certainly was for me. You both passed
our little test with flying colours.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Why did the Chinese waiter have to die?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: A waiter hears many things spoken when
people are relaxed and eating. A waiter has many opportunities for
betrayal.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: He betrayed you?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: He betrayed us. Out this way, quickly!</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: See there, the breeding pools. The pools
are all alive with strange creatures, mutated fish, amphibians, and,
along the small, muddy terraces that border the pools, reptiles. Like
the dysfunctional insect at the gas station, these creatures do not work
very well. They float and swim belly up, lie on their sides at the
bottom of their pools, flop and flounder around, and in general,
ostentatiously fail to function.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Is that where you caught today’s special?</p>
<p>****: The restaurant is controlled by us. We raise these mutant
creatures as food and that is our cover, but of course, we are also
raising them as components for undetectable and hypoallergenic weapons.
Right under the noses of our enemies. And speaking of our enemies, it’s
important that you go back to work at Cortical Systematics. We need to
maintain as many agents there as we can. I’ll take care of the mess at
the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: The Trout Farm is owned by Cortical
Systematics?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: Their corporate slogan should be, “Enemies of Reality”. A
glazed look comes over Pikul. He begins to speak like a robotic
orator.</p>
<p>****: Reality is a fragile thing. Most people think that reality must
of course be the most solid thing, but it isn’t. Reality is threatened
now more than ever. It is being eroded and it is washing away in the
deforming storm of non-reality, which masquerades as reality, and
eventually replaces it. Deformed and crippled and limping and hideous,
threatening to engulf us all. Geller looks at Pikul in admiring
disbelief.</p>
<p>****: Where did that come from?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: The game made me do it.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’m impressed. Nourish is also impressed. He
smiles broadly, then takes Pikul in his arms and hugs him, then
Geller.</p>
<p>****: We love you two now, now that you have proven to be true and
trustworthy Realists. We’ll be in touch. Nourish turns around and walks
back-towards the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: “Enemies of Reality”? Or does it really mean,
enemies of eXistenZ? Are the Realists the game-life version of the Anti-
eXistenZialists, desperately want to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I wouldn’t take it too seriously.</p>
<p><strong>pikul 1</strong>: Of course you wouldn’t. But maybe you
should.</p>
<p>****: But why is the name Cortical Systematics familiar?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We saw it everywhere in Dorsey Nader’s game
store, remember?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yes. So that makes it the game- life version
of our own company. Cortical Systematics is equivalent to Antenna
Research in the real world.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: That’s probably fair to say.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: So, then, do we meekly go back to work and
say nothing? It sounds as though Nourish and his Realists are preparing
to sabotage the Trout Farm. Before you know it, they’ll be planning to
assassinate game designers.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We’re just characters in here. Don’t mix
your real-life loyalties into it or you’ll lose for sure.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Then what do we do next?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’m looking for Dorsey Nader. Is he
here?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Say that again?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Is Dorsey Nader here? The cashier glances
around the store, then locks the register.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Come with me. He’s in the back. The cashier
leads them through the store towards the stockroom door. As they move
amongst the customers, both Pikul and Geller feel that they are being
scutinized carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at
the last moment, so that they can’t be absolutely certain. And as for us
- have we glimpsed some characters from the game that we have already
seen? Possibly even Wittold Levi from the first scene in the church, and
Frances the limo driver, and Gas? We aren’t positive.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: You want him, there he is. Nader lies dead,
the unnatural purple of his face eerily matched by the veiny purple
streaks in the UmbyCord around his neck.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Migod!</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: What happened? In response, the cashier
starts rummaging around on one of the shelves. He soon finds what he was
looking for, and turns around to face them. In his hand is a grotesque,
slightly chewed gristle gun - the one Pikul assembled in the Chinese
restaurant - in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: You shouldn’t have killed the Chinese
waiter.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: He was your contact at the Trout Farm. A
damn good man. His dog brought me this. The cashier toys with the gun’s
claw-like hammer.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But we were contacted there by Yevgeny
Nourish. He seemed to know exactly who we were.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: That’s because Nader tipped him off that
you were coming. Nader was a mole for Cortical Systematics.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re with the Realist underground.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Yes. I was placed here to keep an eye on
Nader. The cashier puts the gun back on the shelf.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: If Nourish isn’t our real contact, who is
he?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Nourish is a double agent for Cortical
Systematics. He was working with Nader to subvert the Realist cause, and
doing it rather well.</p>
<p>****: After all, he got you to assassinate your own contact. But now
you’re going to put a stop to him.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: We are?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: I assume that you both have had spinal port
inserts, bioports, installed.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: We do.</p>
<p>****: Do you both realize that neither of you can be buried on
hallowed ground because of these… these mutilations? Does your bioport
manual tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Are you trying to talk us into having them
removed?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: No, no. In fact, you would be useless to us
without them. We Realists are forbidden to have them, and so we have to
use people like you on occasion.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I don’t understand. Are you wanting us to
jack a game into our bioports?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Game? No. Not a game. A weapon. You go back
to the Trout Farm, and in a familiar place, you find a mouldy old wicker
basket with a thread-bare canvas cover.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: How will we know what to do?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Even a child would know what to do. Someone
begins to knock loudly on a door very near by. The cashier is oblivious,
but’both Pikul and Geller hear it. The stockroom begins to morph away as
its objects are replaced one at a time by chalet objects.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Sorry to interrupt you kids, but I thought
you’d better have something to eat. We knocked on your door a few times
to invite you to dinner… Pikul and Geller sit on the bed, game-pod
between them, UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod. They
look at each other. Pikul shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Come on in. The door opens slowly to reveal
Vinokur, who stands there uncertainly, holding a large tray.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: ..and when we got no answer, I figured you
were playing eXistenZ to try out your new pod, and your new bioport.
Everything’s all right, I take it? An awkward moment, as though Vinokur
has caught the pair having illicit sex. Vinokur moves into the room
towards the table.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Can I leave this here for you? Don’t bother
unporting. I just had to be sure our star designer was in a good place
and that she’d recovered her multi- million-dollar game system from her
defective pod. Vinokur puts down the tray, which holds several plates
covered by smaller, inverted plates to keep the food warm.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Thanks so much, Kiri. This is very sweet of
you.</p>
<p>****: So I take it she has.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Has what?</p>
<p><strong>vinoxur</strong>: Recovered. eXistenZ.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Oh, yes, sure. That’s why we’re so spaced
out.</p>
<p>****: We were right into it, weren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, we were. And it’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Well, that’s a relief. I’ll leave you two
alone. You can leave the tray outside your door when you’re
finished.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What is that you’ve brought?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Believe it or not, it’s Chinese food.
There’s a great Chinese restaurant on the other side of the escarpment
road. Vinokur turns to go.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Kiri?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Have you heard anything yet? I mean, about
the eXistenZ test seminar and the shooting?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Oh, yes. It’s come over all the media now.
You’ve never been more famous. Your face is everywhere, which of course
just.makes it worse. I…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: What? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: They’ve announced the possibility that
Antenna will delay the release of your new system indefinitely, until
they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group
really is. I don’t approve, myself. I don’t think we should bend one
degree to extremists.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Support for the fanatics? What does that
mean?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Well, you know. They’re all coming out of
the woodwork now.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Who is?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: A lot of people are taking the opportunity
to jump on the anti- game bandwagon. They’ve now heard rumours about
what the eXistenZ system is, and they say we’ve gone too far
psychologically, medically, socially, you name it. And I’m afraid I
wouldn’t put it past our competitors to be involved in this, to try to
whip up public opinion and kill our new system before it gets born.</p>
<p>****: You’re sure you don’t want me to contact Antenna, even just to
see what they have to say?</p>
<p>****: Not yet, Kiri. Thanks. Vinokur smiles gently and leaves.</p>
<p>****: Your friend Vinokur is getting shaky. I think he’s going to
turn, you in to Antenna.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Sounds like you might approve of that.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It might be the safest thing. Are you
hungry?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Me neither. I’m terrified to look under the
plates.</p>
<p>****: This “support for the fanatics” thing doesn’t sound too good.
Maybe we should stop…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: We can’t stop. I’ve been noticing some new…
glitches. I’m not sure what they mean. I’m not sure the game is OK.</p>
<p>****: Listen, to be honest, I find your game very confusing. I’m not
sure I want to go back in there, because I’m not convinced I’m going to
keep coming out. Do you really like that feeling?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>****: When eXistenZ is released, it’s gonna wipe the competition off
the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Will it?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It really will do that, yes.</p>
<p>****: Don’t hurt me, Pikul. Don’t make me go back in alone. Play with
me.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Allegra, I’m worried that your game will wipe
me off the face of the earth. I’m thinking I was right never to have a
bioport installed.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: But you have one now. And you’re ported in.
She mischievously flicks the pod nipple, and the chalet melts away
around them.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: That was cruel. I don’t want to be here.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It wasn’t cruel, it was desperate. C’mon,
Pikul. You’ve just got a bad case of first-time user anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I don’t like it here. I don’t know what’s
going on. We’re blundering around together in this unformed world, whose
rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable, or
even Possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by
forces we don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: That sounds like my game, all right. They
are now close enough to the security cubicle’at the end of the corridor
to see the workers ahead of them being frisked by hand, then scanned by
a wand similar to the one that Pikul used at the church.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: That sounds like a game that’s not going to
be easy to market.</p>
<p>****: But it’s a game that everybody’s already playing! Existence,
it’s wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: The cashier said it would be in a familiar
place. Is there such a thing here?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: My assembly bay. They make their way to the
last assembly bay and slip inside it. There is, for the moment, nobody
else there, but several pods have been left on the work tables
half-assembled. Pikul spots it first, in the far corner: a large, mouldy
wicker basket in the opposite corner. Something lumpy in it is covered
by a thread-bare canvas sheet.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Is that it over there? They stroll over to
the basket. Geller kneels down and carefully begins to unwrap it while
Pikul stands guard.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’d say it’s exactly as advertised. The
final wrap comes off. In the basket is a necrotic, purpled, very
diseased-looking pod.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: God, it’s ugly. Even for a game- pod.</p>
<p>****: I have a terrible urge to port into it. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Oh, sure. Yes. Desperate to port into it.
Geller steps over to a bunch of UmbyCords draped over a peg and strips
one off. She sits down on a rotting wooden folding chair next to the
death-pod’s basket and ports in one end of the UmbyCord.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Here we go. Wanna give me a hand?</p>
<p>****: You’re not serious! I mean, that’s a diseased pod! Once you
port into that, you become, you… you…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Exactly. Help me. Pikul kneels beside her as
she pulls up her shirt to reveal her bioport. Geller hands him the free
end of the UmbyCord and he ports it into her.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: How long does it take for the infection to
take hold?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: No time at all.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: And then you quietly port into all the other
pods and spread the infection to them…</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: Something’s wrong!</p>
<p>****: I’m gonna unport you now. Pikul tries to unport Geller, but her
bioport has swollen and seized the jack. He gives the UmbyCord a
tug.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: 0, God, don’t! That really hurts! Pikul lets
go. The death-pod, triggered off by Pikul’s attempt to disconnect
Geller, now begins to convulse in peristaltic waves in its wicker
basket. Pikul looks around desperately and spots a clutch of tools
hanging from nails on the wall.</p>
<p>****: I’m going to cut you free!</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: No, don’t, I’m afraid! But Pikul seizes a
crude linoleum knife used for trimming oversized motherboards and, with
three erratic slashes at the quivering UmbyCord, hacks her loose. Blood
immediately pours out of both ends of the severed cord.</p>
<p><strong>geller c</strong>: Pikul. I’m bleeding to death.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry! I don’t know what else to do!</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: I know what to do. Pikul twists awkwardly
around to see Yevgeny Nourish standing just behind him. He is in the
process of slipping a large propane torch off its wall hook.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: I know exactly what to do. Nourish unscrews
the gas valve and ignites the torch.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Death to Realism! Nourish turns the blazing
torch on the pod in the basket. Where the cone of flame hits the pod, it
begins to shrivel, crackle, sputter fat. The pod itself tries to ripple
away from the searing flame as though it were alive. Nourish laughs and
begins to play the cone over the entire surface of the pod. Geller sinks
to the ground in exhaustion, holds on to Pikul’s leg. The death-pod now
swells and bubbles under the torch’s flame, then explodes with a dull
whump.</p>
<p>****: No, no!</p>
<p><strong>s:</strong>: Gathering up her last shreds of energy, Geller
suddenly shoves a startled Pikul off her cord and picks up the linoleum
knife from where Pikul dropped it. Trailing her bloody cord, she lunges
at Nourishi driving the rusty, curved blade into his back with great
force. Nourish turns to Geller, the torch circling towards her,
wavering. He tries to touch her with the flame, staggers.</p>
<p>****: Death… death to the demoness Barb Brecken… to the…</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Death to who? Oh, yeah… Barb… Nourish drops
the torch, falls to the ground and snaps into the foetal position. A
wall of flame roars up around him, fueled by the straw, wood, canvas,
pod-oils. Pikul jumps over to Geller and picks up the trailing cord,
twists it in his hands until it stops bleeding. All four walls of the
assembly bay are on fire now. The doorway is a flapping sheet of flame.
Mixing with the swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire
plant going on alert: yells, screams, sirens, running feet, doors being
slammed open and closed. Pikul holds Geller tightly. She is limp, weak,
drained in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I think we just lost the game. But now,
strange, anomalous objects begin to appear out a nowhere in the flames -
a chair, a tv set, a bath tub, a table, objects emerging into the game
from the quest chalet. After a moment’s confusion, Pikul smiles.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Or maybe not. And sure enough, the Trout Farm
and its flames and its black cloud melt away.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Allegra, we’re back home. What’s the matter,
what’s wrong? As Geller swims back up into full consciousness, she
begins to talk, mumbling at first, then with terrible clarity.</p>
<p>****: Pikul. It’s here, it’s happened. It’s come back here with us.
We brought it back with us from eXistenZ.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Brought what back? I can’t understand what
you’re saying.</p>
<p>****: We brought the disease back with us. My pod is diseased. As
though realizing the implications of what she’s saying for the first
time, Geller twists away from Pikul and begins to fumble with her
UmbyJack.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Oh God, I’m really going to lose it, I’m
going to lose my game! Unport me! C’mon, unport me! Pikul unports her,
then begins to tug at his own jack. When he takes a close look at the
pod, he can see that it looks - unhealthy. Geller jumps off the bed and
yanks open her bag on the table. She pulls out a tiny hypodermic
syringe, unwraps it, flicks the bubbles out of it, falls to her knees
beside the bed.</p>
<p>****: I’m coming, I’m coming! Geller jabs the pod with the needle. As
sne pushes in the plunger, she starts to massage it with her free hand,
rub it, prod it. She’s so close to it we think she might give it
mouth-to-mouth.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: But this can’t be possible. How can a game
event emerge into real life?</p>
<p>****: There’s a very weird reality- bleed-through effect happening
here. I’m not sure I get it. Pikul finally gets his UmbyCord
unplugged.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What’s in that needle?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It’s an anti-viral serum. It sometimes works
if you get it in time. Unconsciously, Pikul scratches at his bioport.
Geller fixes on him with strange intensity.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Lemme see your bioport.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Lemme see it! Pikul turns and shows it to
her. She begins to examine it with microscopic, clinical attention.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I know what happened. It’s Vinokur, that
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Vinokur?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: He gave you a new bioport, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: He gave you an infected bioport so that my
pod would die and so would my game-system.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I’m infected? Wait a minute!</p>
<p>****: The poor thing was trying to tell us that it was sick by
introducing the theme of disease into our game.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: The theme of disease? I’m fucking reall
infected! Is it going to crawl up my spine and rot my brain?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: All right, don’t panic. I’ve got something
that will help you. Brusquely wiping away her tears, Geller goes over to
her bag and takes out a cork-shaped plastic capsule. She snaps open the
capsule to reveal a knurled, plug-like electronic device.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I’m going to seal up your bioport with this
anti-viral resonator. Geller bends over Pikul and works the device into
his bioport until it’s flush with his skin.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: It uses the Umby pick-ups for power. Should
cleanse all your porting channels of infection in a few hours. It’11
give you a little skin buzz when it’s done. Of course, we can’t play
until then.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yeah, great. Now, listen. This could be
critical. Were you really saying that Vinokur is an</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: agent of the Anti- eXistenZialists? Because
if he is, if he’s with them, then we are really…</p>
<p>****: Oh, God! Pikul, my pod’s dying. Sure enough, the thing is
quivering, rippling, convulsing, turning purple.</p>
<p>****: I can’t help it! I can’t do anything for it! Geller falls to
her knees beside the pod. As though triggered by this action, an
explosion in the nearest chalet blows the windows and the door out of
the guest chalet. Pikul and Geller are knocked to the floor by the
impact of the blast. Waves of heat and debris billow into the room. A
moment of eery silence, and then Pikul and Geller peek wide-eyed over
the-edge of the bed. Flames now engulf the nearby chalet, all too
clearly visible throught the shattered window frames. Sounds of
pandemonium begin to well up from the hills below, and then a figure
steps boldly in through the doorway. When the flamelight flickers over
his face, Pikul and Geller are stunned to see that it is the cashier,
and he is cradling a real-life submachine gun in his arms. The cashier
screams at the bewildered and terrified pair.</p>
<p>****: The uprising has begun! The whole place is on fire! Let’s go!
You’ve got to get out of here. They’ll be looking for you.</p>
<p>****: The cashier? He’s a game character! How can he be here?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I don’t know! I don’t know! The cashier
strides into the room and pulls her to her feet. She tries to pick up
her pod, but the cashier tugs her away from it.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Leave that rotting piece of meat here. It’s
done its job. Let it die.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: But my game! My game’s inside it. I don’t
want my game to die. The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it,
and blows the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect-
board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him, speaks’
forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else out.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Allegra, listen to me. I think we’re still
inside the game. I think your real pod’s out there somewhere, somewhere
safe. I think it’s OK to let go of this one, this pod. It’s not the real
one. A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters against
the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Everybody out! now! The three of them
scramble out into the fiery night.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Up here. We can see everything from
here.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What is it that we’re seeing?</p>
<p>****: The victory of Realism. And you were part of it.</p>
<p>****: The death of eXistenZ. And we were part of it. The cashier
turns on her with his gun. He snaps out his old clip and slams home a
new one. He cocks the gun.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: There’s just one more thing.</p>
<p>****: What are you doing? We’re on your side.</p>
<p>****: How could you be? How could Allegra Geller, the world’s
premiere game designer, be on our side?</p>
<p>****: Oh, Y93.’ We know who you are. You can’t hide inside a game
forever.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Something’s slipped over the edge, here,
Allegra. Something’s all wrong.</p>
<p>****: There. You see what I mean. You see the problem.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: I tried to find you. Thank God I got here
in time. My dog brought me this.</p>
<p>****: You didn’t get here in time. My game is dead.</p>
<p>****: You murdered my game.</p>
<p>****: No, just your pod. I replicated the entire contents of your pod
when I fixed your nerve boards. They’re in safe-keeping. They’re all in
one piece.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You copied eXistenZ?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: Allegra, come over to Cortical Systematics.
Yes, yes, Cortical Systematics. I’m defecting and so are all the Antenna
Research top brass, Pellatt, Melzack, Sherrin, everybody good.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You’re a spy for Cortical Systematics.</p>
<p>****: Wait a minute. Cortical Systematics is just the qame version,
it’s only…</p>
<p>****: Not a spy, exactly. I think of myself as a personnel exchange
engineer. If you want to be reunited with your creation, you’ll come
over to us. eXistenZ, by Allegra Geller. Only from Cortical
Systematics.</p>
<p>****: Only from Antenna Research.</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: But why stay with them? Look at that mess
down there. How could you trust Antenna again, when they’ve endangered
you like this? Geller seems to have lost the thread. She wanders over to
the cashier’s body and disentangles his submachine gun from him.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: You know, this guy was actually going to
kill me. Vinokur looks to Pikul for support.</p>
<p>****: Can you talk to her? I mean, we can take you with us too. But
before Pikul can respond, Geller, now sitting next to the cashier’s body
on the grass, opens fire at Vinokur with the submachine gun. Vinokur
falls with a startled expression on his face. Pikul, absolutely
horrified, runs at Geller and kicks the weapon out of her hand, picks it
up himself.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?! You’ve killed
him! Are you gonna kill me next?</p>
<p>****: C’mon, Pikul. He’s only a game character. And I didn’t like the
way he was messing with my mind.</p>
<p>****: Didn’t you? You didn’t like that and so you killed him?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: He was only a game character.</p>
<p>****: But Allegra. What if we’re not in the game anymore?</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Huh? If… if we… we’re not?</p>
<p>****: If we’re not, then you just killed someone real. A real
person.</p>
<p>****: You see what can happen. It’s important for me that you see
that.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: It wasn’t an accident that you and I ended up
on the run together.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Not an accident? Pikul hefts the submachine
gun in his hands.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: That’s why you never had a bioport. You were one of them.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I still am one of them.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: But you have a bioport now.</p>
<p>****: I thought that was forbidden to Anti-eXistenZialists.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: I made the bioport sacrifice to get close to
you, to make love to my enemy.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: To understand what I have to kill.</p>
<p>****: Then. understand this. Geller produces a tiny electronic remote
controller from the pocket of her shirt.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Understand that I suspected who you were
from the moment you made that fake phone call to yourself in the limo.
Understand that I knew you were my real assassin when you pointed the
gun at me in the Chinese restaurant. She flicks up a safety cover on the
remote’s tip, revealing a toggle switch. Pikul’s hands tense around the
submachine gun.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: And understand that you’re dead. Geller
flips the toggle switch. The base of Pikul’s spine blows out, his shirt
billowing with blood as his bioport explodes.</p>
<p>****: Death to the demon Ted Pikul! His eyes frozen in a death stare,
Pikul falls, rolls down the hill into the underbrush. Smoke creeping up
from the fires below curls over him like a blanket. Arms raised in the
air, Geller dances around on the top of the hill, looking down on the
flames and the chaos.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: Have I won the game? Have I won? Have I won?
The hill, the trees, the flames melt down around her.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: Are you all back? The man whom we knew in the
game as Yevgeny Nourish immediately stands and takes charge. But it is a
different Nourish, exuberant, sensitive and artistic.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: We’re back, Merle. Although I have a
feeling some of our crew might not realize it yet. Shaky laughter from
some of the players. Throughout the following round of comments from the
garners, whom we now realize have been, up to now, playing characters in
a game, we hear nothing from Pikul and Geller. These two, who sit next
to each other and are now holding hands, remain enigmatically
silent.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Wow. Anybody here want a bowl of hot and
sour soup?</p>
<p><strong>vinokur</strong>: I will, if you make sure there</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: are some insect boards in the</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: rice.</p>
<p><strong>female assistant</strong>: How long were we gone?</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: About twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dichter</strong>: It seemed like days. That’s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>female assistant</strong>: Yeah. If you stayed in the
gameworld for most of your life, you could live to be five hundred years
old!</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: The twists and turns at the end made my
head spin. Maybe there were too many, to fast to absorb. Hey, but you
two were fantastic. You guys are game divas! I think you both deserved
to win. There is general agreement amongst the garners about this
compliment to Pikul and Geller. The pair just smile sweetly and bob
their heads modestly at the smattering of applause.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Well me, I was really bummed out at first. I
got knocked out of the game so soon. It was fun to watch the rest,
though. I liked that part where the ones who got knocked out of the game
early got to be spooky customers in the game store.</p>
<p><strong>levi</strong>: But you were so wonderfully bad. So scary and
crazy. I had a lot to do in that first scene in the church but I thought
my character was kind of boring.</p>
<p><strong>gas</strong>: Well, you know, I’m a gas-jockey in real life,
so I was kind of disappointed that I was basically the same thing in the
game. A little more fantasy, there, fellers.</p>
<p>****: Interesting. Interesting. Hold that thought for the focus
group.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Can I keep this? I’ve never felt anything
like it! And I love this little thumb-hole. It’s fantastic!</p>
<p>****: Nice try, but you’re going to have to turn them in because
they’re beta versions, pre- production hand-made specials, and we need
to study them after use for wear and tear and other things. But you’ll
get a certificate for helping us out here - I’m right about that, aren’t
I, Merle?</p>
<p>****: And that will entitle you to reserve one of the first batch of
the TranscendenZ by PilgrImage game modules to hit the market, and at a
seriously discounted price. You’re gonna love it. Amidst applause and
general excitement, Merle turns to the tripod-mounted chalkboard
standing, as in the first scene, at the back of the dais. There we see
the words that she has already written: TranscendenZ by PilgrImage.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: Remember - it’s written like this. Capital T,
capital Z. TranscendenZ. It’s new, it’s from Pilgrimage - capital P.
capital I, and it’s coming soon.</p>
<p>****: I’d just like to say thank you to Mr. Nourish for giving me the
chance to play the role of a star designer. I guess the game picked up
on my ambitions to be like you.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: well, let me first say that I’m kinda glad
I lost this game. I don’t usually play such nasty characters.</p>
<p>****: And, Allegra, you were so good in that role that I suspect it
won’t be long before PilgrImage is after you to sign a designing
contract. And maybe you should take your friend Ted, here, Mr. Pikul,
with you. He’s obviously good in a crisis, and when you design games,
there are plenty of them. Amid the renewed good-natured laughter, Geller
blushes. She reaches out for Pikul’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>geller</strong>: I guess you all could tell that Ted and I
had a relationship prior to our coming here. We really do like to play
together.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: We do, but I’d like to assure everybody here
that Allegra wouldn’t really jump into bed with a security guard unless
he was me.</p>
<p>****: Merle holds out her hand in a gesture of appreciation towards
Nourish.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: Well, what do we say to our brilliant,
award-winning game designer, Yevgeny Nourish? Does he have another
winner on his hands or not?</p>
<p><strong>pc</strong>: Wild applause from all garners, including Geller
and Pikul.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: All right, now, I have to ask you some
questions, before the game half-life wears off. First, let me thank you
for taking part in this test seminar. PilgrImage wants to deliver
nothing but the finest to the game enthusiast, and you have all been a
proud part of that process tonight. When we’ve collected all the
head-sets and game modules, we’ll be handing out a questionnaire to each
of you, and I’d like your answers to the questions to be as honest, as
brutal, as clear as you can make them. Don’t hold back. After that,
we’re going to form a focus group where we’ll discuss details of each of
your experiences playing TranscendenZ. You’ve all had different but
interlocking lives in the game, and I think you’ll be amazed when you
hear each other’s stories.</p>
<p>****: Merle, I was very disturbed by the game we just played.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: It had a very strong, very real anti-game
theme. I mean, it began with the assassination of a game designer.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: or Really? But that’s very creative.</p>
<p>****: But on second thought, I see what you mean. It makes me
nervous. You think it must have come from one of our game players?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: It sure didn’t come from me. The tone of it
in the game was very, very passionate, fanatical. And the atmosphere of
paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming. The whole thing felt unstable,
dangerous, volatile. But worse than that, there was a kind of industrial
espionage subplot. Stealing game-systems, jumping ship from one game
company to another. That kind of thing. They both reflexively begin to
scan the gaming group, who are all innocently dealing with their
question cards.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: So which one of them did these elements come
from?</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Let’s probe it when we do the focus group.
I think we might have been infiltrated here, and if we have, we’ve got a
big security problem. Pikul and’Geller, questionnaires in hand, wander
over to the wary Nourish and Merle. Pikul is now leading the dog that
the security guard was holding for him earlier on, the model for the
game dog in the Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Hi. We were just wondering if we could ask
Mr. Nourish a question, away from all the others.</p>
<p><strong>nourish</strong>: Sure. Shoot.</p>
<p>****: Long as you don’t ask me to fill in your questionnaire.</p>
<p>****: We’ve played your game now, and so we can finally agree with
the others that you are the world’s greatest game artist.</p>
<p>****: We weren’t sure before.</p>
<p>****: Well, thank you so much.</p>
<p>****: Yevgeny, don’t you think you should suffer for all the harm
you’ve done, and intend to do, to the human race?</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>pikul</strong>: Yes. Don’t you think the world’s greatest
game artist ought to be punished for the most effective deforming of
reality?</p>
<p>****: I don’t think this is very…</p>
<p>****: Boys? Could you come over here - right now! But it’s too late.
Geller reaches down and pulls a flap of false fur and skin away from the
dog to reveal two semi- automatic pistols strapped to the dog’s flank.
Pikul and Geller grab the guns, pull back the slides, and cooly execute
Merle and Nourish, who bump grotesquely together as they slump to the
ground. In the stunned silence that follows, only the clatter of the
last few shells bouncing around on the hardwood floor can be heard.
Pikul and Geller glance at each other,. pumped, then fill the
silence.</p>
<p>****: Death to the demon Yevgeny Nourish!</p>
<p>****: Death to PilgrImage! Death to TranscendenZ!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: No, wait, you don’t have to shoot me. I just
wanted to ask you a question. _</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p>****: Hey, tell me the truth. Are we still in the game? Pikul and
Geller look at each other, then into the camera. The church melts down
around them into blackness.</p>
