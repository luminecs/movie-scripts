<h1 id="heathers">heathers</h1>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather told me she teaches people Real
Life.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: She said Real Life sucks Losers dry. If
you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I said so you teach people how to spread
their wings and fly. She said Yes.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I said You’re Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: God, come on Veronica!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What’s your damage, Heather? You ruined
my…</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: God, I’m so sure. Don’t blame me,
blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me
up, Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Yeah, she really wants to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Okay, I’m going, I’m going. Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hello, Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of
Kurt Kelly’s. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically
low-key note in Kurt’s handwriting and we’ll slip it into Martha
Dumptruck’s lunch tray.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Shit, Heather. I don’t have anything
against Martha Dunnstock.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: You don’t have anything for her
either. Come on, it’ll be Very. The note’ll give her shower nozzle
masturbation material for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Don’t think.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Splendid. I’ll dictate. Veronica
needs something to write on. Heather, bend over.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: How nice. Two assholes: no
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Heather Duke, back down.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Dear Martha, you’re so sweet..</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: It’d be so righteous to be in a Veronica
Sawyer-Heather Chandler sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on my Johnson
and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Shit. Right.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Damn right right.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on people, let’s give that leftover
lunch money to people without lunches! Those tater tots you threw away
today are a delicacy in Africa! They’re Thanksgiving dinner!</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: God, aren’t they fed yet? Do they
even have Thanksgiving in Africa?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots;
it’s a real party continent.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Sawyer. Guess what today is?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Ouch….the lunchtime poll. So what’s the
question?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Yeah, so what’s the question?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: God-damn Heather, you were with me
in Study Hall when I thought of it. Such a pillowcase.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hey, this question wouldn’t be that
bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last……</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if
he gave me another topic that was political, I’d spew burrito
chunks.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sorry Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Betty Finn. Gosh…..</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m really sorry I couldn’t make it to
your birthday party last month.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s okay. Your Mom said you had a big
date. Heck, I’d probably skip my own birthday party for a date.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up
the other day.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I was talking with someone!</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Color me impressed. I thought you
grew out of Betty Finn.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Oh great. Here comes Heather.</p>
<p><strong>courtney’s friend</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Hi Courtney. Love your blouse.
Ooh, let me snare a tater.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Thanks. I just got it last night at the
Limited. Totally blew my allowance.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: That’s pretty very. Now check this
out. You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on
the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and
say they’re going to blow up the world in two days. What would you
do?</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: That’s easy. I’d just slide that wad over to
my father. He’s like one of the top brokers in the state.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Wake up. In two days, Earth’s going up
like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Man, in two days, my dad could double my
money. Triple it.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: If I got that money, I’d give it all to
the poor. Every cent.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey D.’s and
get me a Big Mac and some fries.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: But that’s the Famine Fund money.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, even Bob Geldof’s got to eat. If it
makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: If you’re going to openly be a
bitch….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s just why can’t we talk to
different kinds of people?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do
I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn’t mind talking
to the Geek Squad.</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: Did you see that? Heather Number One looked
right at us.</p>
<p><strong>big cynic</strong>: It must be love.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Doesn’t it bother you that everyone in the
school thinks you’re a pirahna?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Like I give a shit. They all want
me, as a friend or a fuck. I’m worshipped at Westerburg and I’m only a
Junior.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Pretend you’re a missionary saving a
colony of cootie victims.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Whatever. I don’t believe this.
We’re going to a party at Remington University tonight and we’re
brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.</p>
<p><strong>geek with braces</strong>: No seriously, I’d probably go to
the Pyrimads. With a girl.</p>
<p><strong>geek with glasses</strong>: Where you going to get a girl,
stud? K-Mart?</p>
<p><strong>big cynic</strong>: Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the
last day of Mankind. You sentimental old fart.</p>
<p><strong>braces</strong>: Geez, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What about you Rodney?</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: I told you she knew my name. I’d change my
life. New clothes. New haircut. New house. New home.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: How sad! Blowing all your cash on
two days of trying to be hip.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: If you’re going to openly be a bitch….</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: God, scan on Martha Dumptruck.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: This is the part I hate. The
waiting. I’d say we’re like twenty minutes from major humiliation. Come
on, Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Veronica?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Damn..</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: ..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers are
the same. Didn’t you see The Breakfast Club?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Look at me. I look great. I’m the
girl in the commercials and the videos.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: I’m the blonde in the bikini on
the horse holding a Pepsi can.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: I’m the princess being spanked on
the throne by Billy Idol’s guitarist’s guitar.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: What do I get out of being friends
with losers. I give them a piece of a winner and they stain me with
loserness.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You get five million dollars but some Martians
are going to zap you in two days. You hear that, Clyde? That’s got to be
the most spooky-ass question I’ve ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>betty finn</strong>: I think we should use the money for an
End-of-the-world get-together. We could invite guys.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: I’d pay Madonna one million dollars to ride my
face like the Kentucky Derby. She should be paying me, though.</p>
<p><strong>female stoner in army jacket</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>all-out nerd</strong>: This is important. With taxes, I’d be
only getting 3.5 million and….</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: If you want a good way to go out before the
aliens land, get a lion from the zoo. Put a remote control bomb up its
butt. When the lion starts tearing you up, press the bomb button. You
and the lion die like as one.</p>
<p><strong>jackie and steve</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Just imagine somebody like your
quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one
would buy Crest.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don’t tell me. Crest would be stained with
loserness.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Yeah, and who wants that on their
teeth?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Oh God, here we go…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A dime increases the time! A buck brings good
luck! Hi Veronica. A five keeps the neighborhood alive! A ten and you
die without sen!</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: You wanted to become a member of
the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn’t already the head of
it, I’d want the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m sorry? What are you oozing about?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: That episode with the note back
there was for all of us to enjoy, but you’re determined to ruin my
day.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: We made a girl want to consider suicide.
What a scream. What a jest.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Come on you jerk. You know you
used to have a sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Ku-urt, let’s pa-arty.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Veronica, could you come back
here?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler and heather mcnamara</strong>: Gross!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: A true friend’s work is never done.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Grow up, Heather. Bulimia’s so
’86.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Color me nauseous.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Maybe you should see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Come on Heather. We want another
look at today’s lunch.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Geez, don’t listen to them.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Did she have the pie or the ice
cream for dessert? And the answer is.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the
Catcher in the Rye wouldn’t put up with their bogus nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Well, you better move Holden out of the
way or he’s going to get spewed.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: God Veronica, drool much? His
name’s Jason Dean. He’s in my American History.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Give me the clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hello Jason Dean.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Greetings and salutations. Call me J.D. Are
you a Heather?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may seem like
a stupid question….</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: There are no stupid questions.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: If you inherit five million dollars the
same day aliens tell the earth they’re blowing us up in two days, what
would you do?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: That’s the stupidest question I’ve ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Who does that new kid think he is with that
coat? Bo Diddley?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Veronica is into his act. No doubt.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Let’s kick his ass.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Shit, we’re seniors, Ram. Too old for that
crap. Let’s give him a scare though.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Probably just row on out to the middle of a
lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: How very.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: You going to eat this?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: What did your boyfriend say when you told him
you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Answer him dick!</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Hey Ram, doesn’t this cafeteria have a No Fags
Allowed Rule?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: It seems to have an open door policy for
assholes though, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: What did you say dickweed?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’ll repeat myself.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: God, they won’t expell him.
They’ll just suspend him for a week or something.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: He used a real gun. They should
throw his ass in jail.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No way. He used blanks. All J.D. really
did was ruin two pairs of pants…Maybe not even that… Can you bleach out
urine stains?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I
thought you were giving up on high school guys.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Never say never.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: What are you going to do, Heather?
Take the two shots or send me out?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Did you have a brain tumor for
breakfast? First you ask if you can be red, knowing that I’m always
red…</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Damn. It’s your turn Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: No, it’s Heather’s turn.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Anyway, I can say never to high
school. I’ve got David.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: King David.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Maybe when you hit maturity you’ll
understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a
Westerburg boy like Ram “Wham-bam- thank-you-maam” Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Ram’s sweet. Yo Heather, you’re
up.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: No way, no day!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Give it up girl!</p>
<p><strong>veronica heather mcnamara</strong>: Holy shit! God, that was
unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: What. A. Shot.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: So tonight’s the night. Are you
two excited?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: I’m giving Veronica her shot. Her
first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it’s keggers with kids
all next year.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Crap. So who’s this Brad guy I’ve been set
up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Don’t worry. David says he’s very
so he’s very.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Heather, your Mother’s here.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Come on whoever wants a ride.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Take a break Veronica, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: So what was the first week of Spring Vacation
withdrawl like?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I don’t know, it was okay, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hey kid, isn’t the prom coming up?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Any contestants worth mentioning?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Maybe. There’s kind of a dark horse now in
the running.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I
read this spy crap.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Because you’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Oh yeah, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You two….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Great pate, but I’m going to have to motor
if I want to be ready for the party tonight.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Corn nuts!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No, but if you’re nice I’ll let you buy me
a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’ve been moved around all my life; Dallas,
Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there’s always a 7-11. Any town, any
time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big
Wheel. Keeps me sane.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Really? That thing in the caf today was
pretty severe.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: The extreme always makes an impression, but
you’re right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I didn’t. Cherry.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Great bike.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Just a humble perk from my Dad’s Construction
company or should I say Deconstruction company?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I don’t know. Should you?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: My father seems to enjoy tearing things down
more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? “Bringing every State
to a Higher State.”</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Time out….Jason Dean. Your Pop’s Fred Dean
Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Everybody’s life’s got static. Is your life
perfect?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Sure, I’m on my way to a party at
Remington University.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: It’s not perfect. I don’t really like my
friends.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I don’t really like your friends either.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: It’s like they’re just people I work with
and our job is being popular and shit.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Maybe it’s time for a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Throw your coats on the bed, girls.</p>
<p><strong>whining student</strong>: That exam was so bogus.</p>
<p><strong>coed one</strong>: Oh I know. Which exam?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Veronica, this is Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Excellent. Did you girls bring your partying
slippers?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Yeah, let’s party.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She loves to party.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Dear Diary, I want to kill and you have to
believe…..damn pen!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You have to believe it’s for more than
selfish reasons. More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle. You have to
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: So, are you a cheerleader?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You’re pretty enough to be one.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Gee, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s so great to be able to talk to a girl and
not have to ask “What’s your major?” I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: So when you go to college, what kind of
subjects do you think you’ll study?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Come on David, let’s go back to
the party.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t worry, we will. You’re just so hot
tonight. I can’t control myself.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: So what do you say we head up to my room and
have a real party. I’ve got the best Windham Hill C.D. collection in the
dorm.</p>
<p><strong>big amiable student</strong>: Brad-man, Robinson’s looking
for you. He says he owes you for blow and he just got some product
himself.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You’re kidding. That pecker actually scored
something on his own?</p>
<p><strong>big amiable student</strong>: He’s in Sheila’s room, guy.
Party up.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV
anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn’t drinking
and driving?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Jeez, right, then why don’t I do
drugs?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey, don’t run away now.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Seventeen is the last year Mom buys the
Twinkies. When you make the jump from working weekends at Pizza Hut to
thirty years at I.B.M., you lose something. Not innocence–power.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Christ, I can’t explain it, but I’m
allowed an understanding that my parents and these Remington University
assholes have chosen to ignore. I understand I must stop Heather.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: How’s my little cheerleader? Now I know
everyone at your high school isn’t so uptight, come on.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hey really, I don’t feel so great.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Let’s do it on the coats. It’ll be
excellent.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I have a little prepared speech I give
when my suitor wants more than I’d like to give him…. Gee Blank, I had a
nice….</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna
get laid.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You don’t deserve my fucking speech!</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: What’s your damage? Brad says
you’re being a real cooze.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather, I feel awful, like I’m going to
throw up. Can we jam, please?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: No. Hell no.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Betty Finn was a true friend and I sold
her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather’d
be like offing the Wicked Witch of the West. Or is it East? West! I
sound like a psycho. Tomorrow I’ll be kissing her aerobicized ass but
tonight let me dream of a world without Heather. A world where I am
free.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: You stupid cunt!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You goddamn bitch!</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: You were nothing before you met
me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you
were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a
Remington Party! What’s my thanks? It’s on the hallway carpet. I get
paid in puke!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Monday morning, you’re history.
I’ll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to
Jefferson. No one at Westerburg’s going to let you play their reindeer
games.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: S’okay….</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a
match?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Sure. But I’m Blue.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Goddamn, no wonder you looked so mangled when
I came through the window.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’ve always treated Heather’s teen queen
power plays as bullshit…..</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: But I’m really scared. Who am I going to
eat lunch with on Monday? I sound like an Afterschool Special.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you
know. I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re welcome. It’s a lot more
interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the
neighbor’s swing set.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, I don’t know. There’s something to be
said for…Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What a night.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What a life. I almost moved into high
school out of sixth grade because I was some genius. We all decided to
chuck the idea because I’d have trouble making friends,
blah-blah-blah.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my
grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers
before curfew. Some genius.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to
die.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Killing her won’t solve anything.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: A well-timed lightning bolt through her window
and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be
cast fucking adrift.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Well then, I’ll pray for rain.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: See the condoms in the grass over there. We
killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Just saying it’s not hard to end a life.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: There’s a big difference between the most
popular girl in the school and dead sperm.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I guess I don’t know what the hell I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I know exactly what the hell you’re
talking about and you’re right, you don’t know what the hell you’re
talking about. Let’s just grow up, be adults, and die.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Good plan.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: But before that, I’d like to see Heather
Chandler puke her guts out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chandler</strong>: We are leaving soon for your
grandmother’s. If you care to join us…</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Bag that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chandler</strong>: Is that a “No” in your lingo?</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Lingo this.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning
trip to Grandma’s even when she’s not hungover.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Then let’s just concoct ourselves a little
hangover cure that’ll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What about orange juice and milk? What’s
the upchuck factor on that?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’m a Pine-Sol man, myself.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don’t be a dick. That stuff’ll kill
her.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: O-kay. We’ll cook up some soup and put it
in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or
Bean-with-Bacon?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I
say we go with Big Blue.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What are you doing? You just can’t
go…..Besides, she’d never drink anything that looks like that.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Okay we’ll use this. She won’t be able to tell
what she’s drinking.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Just give me a cup, jerk.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we
could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Yeah, great.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No luck? Well, milk and orange juice’ll do
quite nicely. Quite nicely.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Chick-en.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re not funny.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Bonehead.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Morning, Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle
surprise. Hear about Veronica’s affection for regurgitation?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: We both said a lot of things we didn’t
mean, last night.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Did we? How the hell’d you get in
here?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Veronica knew you’d have a hangover. So I
whipped this up. Family recipe.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Did you put a phlegm globber in it
or something? I’m not drinking that piss.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I knew this stuff would be too intense.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Intense? Grow up. You think I’ll
drink it just because you call me chicken.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Just give me the cup, jerk.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Corn nuts!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Something tells me you picked up the wrong
cup.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No shit, sherlock. I can’t believe it. I
just killed my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: And your worst enemy.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Same difference. Oh jesus, I’m gonna…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: What are we going to tell the cops? “Fuck it
if she can’t take a joke, Sarge.”</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Stop kidding around. I’m going to have to
send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’m just a little freaked, all right? You got
what you wanted, you know.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: It’s one thing to want somebody out of
your life. It’s another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: We did a murder. In Ohio, that’s a crime. But
if this was like a suicide thing…..</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Like a suicide thing?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Adolescence is a period of life fraught with
anxiety and confusion.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I can do Heather’s handwriting as well as
my own.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: “You might think what I’ve done is
shocking…”</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: “To me though, suicide is the natural answer
to the myriad of problems life has given me.”</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: That’s good, but Heather would never use
the word “myriad.”</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: This is the last thing she’ll ever write.
She’ll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: She missed “myriad” on a vocab test two
weeks ago, all right?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: That only proves my point more. The word is a
badge for her failures at school.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re probably right…“People think just
because you’re beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody
understood I had feelings too.”</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: “I die knowing no one knew the real me.”</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: That’s good. Have you done this
before?</p>
<p><strong>principal gowan</strong>: Any other Principal would take the
same position. Keep things business as usual.</p>
<p><strong>counselor hyde</strong>: Heather Chandler’s not your everyday
suicide. She was very popular.</p>
<p><strong>principal gowan</strong>: I let the kids go before lunch and
the switchboard’ll light up like a Christmas Tree.</p>
<p><strong>kevin staples</strong>: The parents will be sympathetic, sir.
These are troubled times for the young.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pope</strong>: I must say I was impressed to see that
she made proper use of the word “myriad” in her suicide note after
brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I find it profoundly disturbing that we are
told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is
adequate mourning times and misused vocabulary words.</p>
<p><strong>principal gowan</strong>: Oh Christ.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: The school, meaning both students and
teachers, must revel in this revealing moment. I suggest we get everyone
into the cafeteria and just talk. And feel. Together.</p>
<p><strong>principal gowan</strong>: Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me
when the shuttle lands…Now is this Heather the cheerleader?</p>
<p><strong>counselor hyde</strong>: That would be Heather Mcnamara.</p>
<p><strong>principal gowan</strong>: Damn. I’d be willing to go half a
day for a cheerleader.</p>
<p><strong>kevin staples</strong>: Let’s just pack it in an hour
early.</p>
<p><strong>principal gowan</strong>: Done. I hate Mondays.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget it!
Just sit down. I’m just so thrilled to be given an example of everything
I’ve taught you. That example is Heather Chandler. I have the note!</p>
<p><strong>male student</strong>: All right!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’ll pass the suicide note around the room
so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself. Let us share together
the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?</p>
<p><strong>female student</strong>: I heard it was really gnarly. She
drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed….</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Now, now, we’re not here to rehash the
coroner’s report. Let’s talk emotions.</p>
<p><strong>the all-out nerd</strong>: Are we going to be tested on
this?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Heather and I used to go together, but she
said I was boring. I realize now I wasn’t really boring. She was just
dissatisfied with her life.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: That’s very good Peter.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Dear Veronica, Heather was your
soulmate…..Share.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather was cool, but cruel. The good
looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: She realized the only way she could be
happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was
death.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Oh God, it’s so unfair. It’s just
so unfair! We should get a whole week off not just an hour.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Write the School Board.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Watch it, Heather. You could actually be
digesting food.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Yeah, where’s your urge to
purge?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Look, heather left behind one of
her Swatches. She’d want you to have it, Veronica. She always said you
couldn’t accessorize for shit.</p>
<p><strong>female stoner in army jacket</strong>: I’m sorry about your
friend. I thought she was your usual airhead bitch. Guess I was wrong.
Lot of us were.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: What a waste.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Oh the Humanity.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Veronica, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>squealing girl</strong>: Everyone in the shower!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Do I deliver or do I deliver?</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: Hurry up, we’re going to get caught.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Mellow out Geek. Man, I never should have
brought you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Let’s see some pussy!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Does this have something to do with menstrual
cramps and shit?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: We’re on Candid Camera, dudes. I can feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do you deliver or do you deliver?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: That was seriously warped,
Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: T.V. cameras!</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My
clothes!</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: I choose to remember the good times.
Like when we got our ears pierced at the mall.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: I can still hear those late night
talks on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The day I won her that stuffed rhino at the
4-H Fair, she said to me….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re an asshole! Mute him!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Mute!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Next channel, darling.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather, how many networks did you run
to!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh, I have to hear this.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: In my heart, Heather’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What are you talking about? She hated you!
You hated her! What are you smiling at?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Heather Chandler is more popular than ever
now.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yeah. Scary stuff.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Why son, I didn’t hear you come in.</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: Hey Dad, how was work today?</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: It was miserable. Some damn tribe of
withered old bitches doesn’t want us to terminate that fleabag hotel.
All because Glenn Miller and his band once took a shit there. It’s just
like Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: That was the one with the wheat right?</p>
<p><strong>big bud dean</strong>: The Save the Memorial Oak Tree
Society. Showed those fucks.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Thirty Fourth of July fireworks attached to
the trunk. Arraigned but Acquitted.</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost forgot
to introduce my girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Jason, why don’t you ask your little friend to
stay for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: My Mom’s making my favorite meal tonight.
Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was
waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>big bud dead</strong>: Right, son.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Take a break Veronica, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: So what was the first day after Heather’s
suicide like?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I don’t know, it was okay, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this
dark horse prom contender?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I
smoke these damn things?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Because you’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Oh yeah, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You two….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Greate pate, but I’m going to have to
motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>father ripper</strong>: I blame not Heather but rather a
society that tells its youth that the answers are on the MTV video
games. We must pray the other teenagers of Sherwood, Ohio, know the name
of that “righteous dude” who can solve their problems….</p>
<p><strong>father ripper</strong>: It’s Jesus Christ and he’s in the
book.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: May Heather Chandler rest in peace even
though she committed suicide. For-the-kingdom-the-power-and-the-
glory-are-yours-now-and-forever-Amen.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Oh God, this is a tragic thing and
sometimes I have a hard time dealing with it and stuff. Please send
Heather to heaven and all that. Thanks. I mean, Amen.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Dear God, make sure this never happens to me.
I do not think I could handle suicide and that’s the God’s honest truth.
Pardon the pun. Fast-early-acceptance- into-an-Ivy-League-school-and-
please-let-it-be-Harvard. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Jesus God in heaven, uh, why did you kill such
hot snatch. That’s a joke, man. People are so serious. Hail Mary, who
aren’t in heaven, pray for us sinners….so we don’t get caught. Another
joke, man.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: I prayed for the death of Heather
Chandler many times and I felt bad every time I did, but I kept doing it
anyway. Now I know you understood everything. Praise Jesus.
Alleluia.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hi. I’m sorry. Technically I didn’t kill
Heather Chandler but hey, who am I trying to kid, right? I just want my
high school to be a nice place. Amen. Did that sound bitchy?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Veronica. What are you doing
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Ram asked me out, but he wants to
double with Kurt and Kurt doesn’t have a date.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather, I’ve got something going with
J.D.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid
on hold tonight, I’ll never forget it.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: We on tonight man?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird
funeral, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Pretty weird.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Let’s kick his ass.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Cool off, we’re seniors.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Goddamn Geek!</p>
<p><strong>braces</strong>: Sit and spin.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: That little prick.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: All right you piece of shit fag, do you like
to suck big dicks?</p>
<p><strong>braces</strong>: Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: Leave him alone, Kurt.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Say it!</p>
<p><strong>braces</strong>: Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.</p>
<p><strong>braces</strong>: I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm! I can’t
get enough of them. Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: I’m sure your friends are happy to hear that.
Right, guys?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Don’t worry, Ram’s been so sweet
lately, consoling me and stuff. It’ll be really very. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: All right, but I hope it isn’t going to be
one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to
tip cows.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Is it sleeping, dude?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: I think so, man.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping
is the fucking greatest.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Punch it in!</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Count of three, guy.</p>
<p><strong>kurt and ram</strong>: One. Two. Three!</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: “When I get that feeling, I need sexual
healing…..”</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yeah, right, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: What is this shit?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m doing a favor for Heather. A double
date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: “Feel like making bah da dah bah da dah, feel
like making love.”</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Another fucking Heather. I’m sorry. I’m
feeling kind of superior tonight. Seven high schools in seven states and
the only thing different was my locker combination. We’ve broke through
the peer pressure cooker. So what if we had to kill Miss
Popularity..</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: So what? Don’t smile like that, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Our love is God. Let’s get a Slurpee.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: “And she’s buying the stairway to
heaven..”</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’m not belittling the Famine Fund Peter,
but we’re talking teen suicide! Westerburg finally got one and I’m not
going to blow it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Great. Heather gets the headline and I get
crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hi Guys. I came to check on this week’s
lunchtime poll topic.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Veronica, sit down.
That funeral yesterday must have been really rough.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>yearbook girl</strong>: We were, uh, wondering if maybe you
had some poems or artwork that Heather did that we could put in the
Heather Chandler yearbook spread?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>yearbook girl</strong>: Take a look. We’ll have a two page
layout with her suicide note up here in the right hand corner.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: It’s more tasteful than it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I don’t know. This thing leaves a bad
taste in my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Like last night, Veronica?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m sorry? I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: You did last night.</p>
<p><strong>courtney’s friend</strong>: Kurt told us of your little
date.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yeah. And? I left him drunk and flailing
in cowshit.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I don’t know. He was really detailed.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Shut up, Courtney.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don’t shut up. I’d like to know just what
I did.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let me show you that lunchtime poll topic,
Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I rarely listen to Neanderthals like Kurt
Kelly bu-ut he said you were bent over like a coffee table with Kurt
going in one end and Ram coming in the other. Pardon the pun.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I
didn’t expect to be calling either. I guess my emotions took over. I was
wondering if you wanted all those things you’ve been saying to really
happen. It’s always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once……
Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: That’s right, tonight. In the woods behind
the school. Don’t forget Ram.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Women.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I don’t get the point of me writing a
suicide note when we’ll just be shooting them with blanks.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Get crucial. We won’t be using blanks this
time.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You can’t be serious? Hey listen, my
Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Do you take German?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: French.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather
snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They’re like tranquilizers only
they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any
real harm.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: So it looks like the person’s been shot
and killed when they’re really just unconscious and bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look like they
shot each other. By the time Kurt and Ram regain consciousness, they’ll
be the laughingstock’s of the school. The note’s the punchline. How’d it
turn out?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: First tell me this similarity is not
incredible.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Incredible similarity.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Ram and I died the day we realized we
could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding
world. The joy we shared in each other’s arms was greater than any
touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer
Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Exquisite, but I don’t think ununderstanding
is a word.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: We don’t want to make them out to be too
secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn’t
kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: They used them on themselves to make it look
like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant
to seriously produce.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Neat. Let’s try it out on J.F.K.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: It doesn’t work on small animals!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Uh well hey, let’s take a look at the
homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little
disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: We’ve got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan
Crawford post card, and lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You must have had fun.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one
perfecto thing I picked up…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Perrier water!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier.
It’s come a long way.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: This is Ohio. If you don’t have a brewsky in
your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh, you’re so smart. How about a little
heterosexuality before we go?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa!
Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and…</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Shut the fuck up, all right.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the
finest pussy in the school and we don’t even have to buy it a hamburger
and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Hi Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: So do we just start fucking?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’ve made a circle on each end of the
clearing. Ram, you come over here.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: When you get in the circle, strip.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I was hoping you’d rip my clothes off me,
sport.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Oh. Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Count of three, guys.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Shucks.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Did you miss him completely?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yeah, but don’t worry, it was worth it
just to see the look on….</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Don’t move! I’ll get him back!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: I heard it that time!</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Another gunshot! From the woods!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Kurt doesn’t look too good.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Remember he’s left-handed.</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Keep going until you hit the clearing!</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Call in!</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: I heard something out there. I’m checking it
out.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Think what I heard was just a stinking owl.
All I got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car. Should I pry
them apart?</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: What’s the deal?</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: That’s Kurt Kelly!</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Oh my God, suicide? Why?</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Oh man, they were fags!</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade magazine
Honorable Mention…</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Wait a second. How did they shoot each other
if we heard two separate sets of gunshots?</p>
<p><strong>milner</strong>: Oh the humanity.</p>
<p><strong>kevin staples</strong>: After every touchdown or whatever,
they give each other a little slap on the bottom. It seems innocent…</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pope</strong>: Look at this. “Ununderstanding.”</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Will you shut up! We were in a similar
position Monday and I thoughtfully suggested that we get the students
together for an unadulterated emotional outpouring. You took the
suggestion as an opportunity to play yet another round of “Let’s laugh
at the Hippie.”</p>
<p><strong>counselor hyde</strong>: Pauline, if you want a tryout for
the school play….</p>
<p><strong>principal gowan</strong>: Shut up, Paul. I’ve seen a lot of
bullshit–angel dust, switchblades, sexually perverse photography
exhibits involving tennis racquets, but this suicide thing….I guess it’s
all on Pauline’s wavelength. We’re just going to write off today, and
Friday she can do her little little love-in or whatever. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: We killed them, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Ich Luge bullets! I’m an idiot!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You believed it because you wanted to believe
it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I did not want them dead.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Did to.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Did not.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Did to.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Did not.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Ah, young love.</p>
<p><strong>squeeling girl</strong>: Did you hear? School’s cancelled
today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual
suicide pact.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Football season’s over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram
had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Sure. Can we make an ice run before the
funeral?</p>
<p><strong>mr. kelly</strong>: If there’s any way you can hear me, Kurt
buddy, I don’t care that you really were some pansy. You’re my
flesh-and-blood. You made me proud. I love my homosexual son. My son’s
gay and I love him!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Your son’s dead and you love him.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a
son with a limp wrist with a pulse?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How was the funeral?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Superb.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: It looks like the teen suicide
epidemic has hit home in Sherwood as the death toll at Westerburg High
rockets to three.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and
Rupert “Ram” Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there’s one
thing they didn’t have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: That’s three things.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: It rained everyday of my Maui
vacation, but hey, I didn’t kill myself. I’m Whitney James,
Commentary.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Thanks Whitney, but I hate to say it. It
looks like you brought that rainy weather back with you. Tomorrow’s
forecast calls for…</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No, it’s okay J.D., I just kind of wanted
to talk…..Oh, a newsmagazine show on Channel 16. Really? On the
suicides. No, sounds great. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a
body count.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: The most popular people in the school are
dead. Everybody’s sad, but it’s a good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather
depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge
thing but what really frightens me is that I’m not frightened by what
J.D.’ll do next. It’s God versus my boyfriend and God’s losing….</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Peter, kill the jukebox.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Could I have your attention?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Our school has been torn apart by tragedy.
I’m here today to fuse it back together through love! I want everyone to
clasp hands. We need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit.
Let’s begin a new happiness!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Yo, what’s the problem? I know you know how
to hold hands. Ring-around- the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy…Forget it! I’m
just so thrilled to announce that Whitney James of WETC News is taping a
rap session with students from area high schools including
Westerburg.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Let’s show the world Westerburg is a
diverse happy home, not Suicide Central! You know there’s some people
who say Westerburg is too weak and wimpy a school to be on T.V. Is that
true?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No or Hell No?</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: Hell no!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I can’t hear you….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Can’t you see this is a special
moment?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I was just making it more special.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Veronica, there you are!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You people are in charge of getting
delegates from every clique in the school to be on the Whitney James
Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special. Let’s be able to say we were
the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Westerburg? A happy family?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’m sure you’ll work something out.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll work something
out.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yes. Yes. We’ll work something out. I
swear to God. Won’t we J.D.?…J.D.?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Greetings and salutations.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You shoulda stuck around, jerk.
Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: She wants to ignore the high school
experience. Our way’s better. We scare people into not being
assholes.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don’t even talk about that stuff!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You mean the time you blew Kurt Kelly’s ass
away!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You can be so immature!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You kids are making too much damn noise.</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: We beat the bitches.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh beautiful. The Beaver’s home.</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: Judge told em to slurp shit and die.</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.
Masterful. When that blew, it set off a pack of thermals I’d stuck
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: It’s great to be alive!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Do you like your father?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Never given the matter much thought. Liked my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: They said her death was an accident. But she
knew when the explosives were set to go off. She knew…</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Let’s just…settle down. Ms. Fleming has
given us a chance to atone for…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a
concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Whoa! Amazing!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: It’s the new BigFun video!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: We’ve made MTV.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: We’re breaking up. I am out!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Wha-at? Come on, there’s another T.V. in the
kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re getting too cool for me, J.D. I
don’t know how to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Our relationship’s moving fast, I know, but I
have real, real respect for you.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m going to make this Ms. Pauline thing
work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase….</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Phase my ass! You’ll be back! I’m storming
Normandy beaches and you’re running in place with Pauline Fonda’s
airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You’ll be
back.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: What the…..</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Where did you get these?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Oh, I just had the nicest chat with
Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It’s scary how everyone’s got a story
to tell….Would you care to see the canoeing shots?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Strength. Westerburg doesn’t need mushy
togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader
but…</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: But she couldn’t handle it.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden
says his ideal job’d be making sure some kids don’t fall off a cliff. He
doesn’t realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you’ll back
off the cliff yourself.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Very very. The photographs?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll ask you to do me a favor.
You’ll get the negatives and everything back then.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: In the meantime, strength, And hey, there’s a
little gift.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want
yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody
what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Something like that. Will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Damn, you’re a shrewd one. Shrewd.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I just want to show different kinds of
people can get together and it doesn’t have to be Vietnam. You don’t get
treated badly here do you?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t get treated at all, but hey, don’t
worry about it. I’ll do your thing. It’ll give my Mom a smile.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Things are going to change, Earl.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Guess who?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Ouch. Your machine’s got the most
obnoxious beep. Heather, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on anybody’s carpet
lately?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Is this David? Heather’s David? What are
you doing….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What can I say? I was pretty broken up by
Heather C.’s suicide. I needed somebody super-sensitive like Heather
D.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m delirious for the both of you. Can you
put Heather on?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She can’t really talk right now.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hello, Betty…..</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t believe it. I’m winning.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don’t get cocky, girl.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I missed you. I know I’m not as, as exciting
as your other friends.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: That’s bullshit. Just shoot.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ronnie, I’m still a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Betty, your daydreams are a lot better
than my realities, believe me. I’m afraid though it’s time to get your
butt kicked.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ronnie!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hey, you’re not settling for the two shots
are you? Knock me out girl. It’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: It’s not my style, okay?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Nice guys finish last. I should know.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Brav-o!</p>
<p><strong>betty finn</strong>: I’ve got to get going, Veronica. See you
at the studio.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Sure. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Croquet won’t be the same without
Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot…The
Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special isn’t going to be
taped at the studios. It’s going to be done in the Park.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But I thought…</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: It’s going to be like a big picnic.
Bring some potato salad…HEY, I’M RED!</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: So did you call people to tell them how to
get to the studio tonight?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Back off. I called everyone, even that
Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone a bath. I told Betty just
now…Damn!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re so polluted. Talking down to
people, making fake notes….</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: I don’t see what gives you the right
to lecture, Ronnie. You were soulmates with Betty Finn until you
realized you’re the cover of Seventeen magazine and she’s the before
half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Some people just don’t matter. Why
should those who do carry their weight? Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No, you’re wrong. It’s not even your
turn.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: She’s right…..Boy, croquet’s not
the same without Heather.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Ich Luge bullets. I’m such a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>peter dawson</strong>: Veronica, I thought we lost you.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I was waiting for my friend Betty.</p>
<p><strong>peter dawson</strong>: Teens talking it out on T.V.! Would it
be pretentious of me to attach a videocassette of the show on my
Princeton application?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Shucks, that’s a great idea, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>peter dawson</strong>: This is excellent, but I thought we
were going to get equal representation on this thind: Geeks,
Gearheads…</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: They’re probably just being
fashionably late.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Is this very or what? Oh, you’ve gotta
meet Whitney James! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Whitney, here’s my friend…..</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: Ah please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: I got a confession to make. My name
used to be Heather, too.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: But my name’s not…</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: People just don’t take the name
Heather seriously. They should, shouldn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I’m so sorry. I was led to believe there
were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at
this gathering.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: Oh, I was scared of the same thing,
Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have
contemplated suicide you’re stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled
with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts
of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: I’m not knocking teen suicide. It’s
exciting stuff. My personal faves are those kids from loaded families
grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a B.M.W. on their
birthday, they’re still quote-unquote depressed. It’s ridiculous. People
who say money can’t buy happiness don’t know where to shop.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: The world wants winners, I guess. Not
people stained with loserness.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: Stained with loserness. Oh, I like
it. Can I use that. It’d be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: It’s all yours, Heather. Now if you’ll
excuse me, I’m going to go throw up.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: Sure. Ciao.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Everyone take their places on the stage!
Isn’t this thrilling?!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: But Ms. Fleming, it’s just not right.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: What, the wine? I realize you’re all under
21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch. Could we get some more
light up here?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Our schools have been torn apart by
tragedy. Let’s fuse them back together through love. Let’s clasp hands
and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Let’s begin a new happiness…</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: …with no more suicide…</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: Oh yeah…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Holy traumatic experiences, Batman. I’m sorry
you felt you had to put yourself through all that shit. I told you it
wouldn’t…Hey, it’s in the past already, right?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No more problems….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Cute.</p>
<p><strong>whitney james</strong>: Let’s go for another take.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Bargain matinees are for the first show
only.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Hey Veronica, how’d that Teenage Prevention
T.V. Suicide thing go?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Color me educated. I learned high school
happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn’t know reality if
it lived in her uterus, and reality’s name’s Heather James. Also, J.D.’s
a major creep.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about, honey,
but can it wait a bit. We’re watching this special program on Teen
Problems.</p>
<p><strong>dan rather voice</strong>: Oh sure, I’ll bet even back when I
went to school there were drugs, even sex, but they were simpler times.
The Sherwood suicides tell the bitter truth of today’s young. What a
waste…Oh</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Turn that back on!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: This condescending junk makes suicide seem
like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel
like shit! Get the respect in death you’ll never get in life.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: If we’re not going to watch that program, can I
put on the game?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Are you trying to tell me it is not a troubled
time for the nation’s youth?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares
about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he’ll scream at his
son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m lost. You don’t get enough attention, you
get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: All we want is to be treated like human
beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny
rabbits to be patronized.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I don’t patronize bunny rabbits.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Treated like human beings? Is that what you
said little Miss Voice of a Generation? Just how do you think adults act
with other adults? You think it’s all just Doubles Tennis. Adults can be
horrible to other adults. When teenagers complain that they want to be
treated like human beings, it’s usually because they are being treated
like human beings.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I guess I picked the wrong time to be a
human being.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You’ll live. Want some pate?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica,
you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there
suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck
tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a
suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Is she dead?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: That’s the punchline. She’s still
alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the
popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I said I was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: You are out of control. Heather and
Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide
hotlines in her diapers.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re not funny. Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha
couldn’t take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a
better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot
Probs is on.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Oh shit, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: This sounds like a good one.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: Dude, you’ve got to remember if it wasn’t for
the courage of the fearless crew, the Minnow would be lost. The Minnow
would be lost! Next call!</p>
<p><strong>troubled male voice</strong>: But Skipper hates me….</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: Whoa, they’re coming out early tonight. What
ever happened to teen pregnancy and acne? You’ve got the Dogcatcher on W
etcetera and you’re listening to Hot Probs. Who am I talking to?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: My name is Heather, I mean, not
Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: It’s Madonna. Geez, no, not
that.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: Ah, Minnie. Don’t tell me, Mickey just
confessed he got A.I.D.S. from Goofy at a New Year’s Eve Party.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: God has cursed me, I think. The
last time I had sex, the guy killed himself the next day. I’m failing
Math.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather told everyone about Heather.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yes, Dear Diary, I’ve cut off Heather
Chandler’s head and Heather Duke’s head has sprouted in its place like
some mythological thing my eighth grade boyfriend would know about.
Heather’s even doing the old note trick.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I did it J.D.’s way. I did it Pauline’s
way. Nothing’s changed. I guess that’s Heather’s way. And jesus, what
about J.D.? I can’t get him out of my head. Are we going to the Prom? Or
to Hell? And where’s Heather going?</p>
<p><strong>gruff teacher</strong>: Where’s Heather going?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: She’s going to cry-y-y.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Fucking child protector caps.</p>
<p><strong>gruff teacher</strong>: Now where’s she going? Is somebody
getting raped today on All My Children or what?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: What are you trying to do? Kill
me?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What were you trying to do? Sleep?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Suicide is a private thing.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re giving your life away to become a
goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That’s got to be the least
private thing I can think of.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: But what about Heather and Ram and
Kurt?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: If everyone jumped off a bridge, young
lady, would you?</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Probably….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hey now, if you were happy every day of
your life, you wouldn’t be a human being, you’d be a game show host.</p>
<p><strong>heather mcnamara</strong>: Let’s knock off early. Go to the
mall. Something lame like that.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: So it’s come to this. Heather Chandler did
polls. I want you to do a Petition, as a favor, as the favor. Do you
know the group Big Fun?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to
play a Prom. It could be Westerburg’s if we can get everyone’s John
Hancock.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: I’ll get right on it coach. And hey, a
little gift. I won’t be needing it.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Oh great. Here comes Heather.</p>
<p><strong>courtney’s friend</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I’ve
gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are
tuneless Eurofags. People love me! My God, you haven’t signed!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: People love you but I know you. Jennifer
Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the
cafeteria. And Doug Hylton…</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: So some people need different kinds of
“convincing” than others…. Hey, just sign the petition!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don’t talk to me like that.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: It was J.D.’s idea! He made out the
signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Jealous much?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather, why can’t you just be a friend?
Why are you such a MegaBitch?</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Because I can be! The same fucking
cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you
really think, if Betty Finn’s fairy godmother made her Cool, she’d still
act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Wanna go out tonight?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I was thinking more along the lines of
slitting Heather Duke’s wrists open and making it look like a
suicide.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I could be up for that. I’ve already started
underlining meaningful passages in Heather’s copy of Catcher in the Rye,
if you know what I mean. So are we on?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: It’s over, J.D. Over!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I don’t get it! You were wrong! I was right!
Strength, damnit! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Your friend Jason Dean just stopped by. He
seemed very concerned about you. He said he thinks you might try to kill
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You have been depressed lately. Oh, he said
this is for you.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh my God….</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He says we should keep you away from sharp
objects, closed garages, toxic…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: “You can’t ever find a place nice and peaceful
because there isn’t any.”</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Nice. It’s got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey-
I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me- so-let’s-commit-suicide
ambience. Give it a try, underline something.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think
you’re a rebel! You’re not a rebel! You’re a sick psycho! Do you think
you’re a rebel? Do you think you’re a rebel? I wanna know!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: “You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let’s call
the whole thing off…Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I
usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo.
So mysterious…</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Wait a….You’re not listening! I’m not on
your side….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You’re still not listening! I’m not..</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: This knife is filthy.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: What in the hell do you think I’m doing?
Taking out her tonsils?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I think I know Heather a bit better than
you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be
absolutely spotless.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: How’s this? Can you see your fucking
reflection?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Tomorrow someone else will move into her
place. That person could be me. Ha, there’s only one of us who knows
Heather’s handwriting and if you think I’m doing another suicide
note.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You don’t get it, do you? Society nods its
head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself.
We don’t need gloves and does anyone really care about exact
handwriting?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Perfecto. Man, I’ve even got a marked-up
Catcher in the Rye. What else does a suicide need?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: If you’ll excuse me……</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No-o!</p>
<p><strong>father ripper</strong>: Eskimo.</p>
<p><strong>father ripper</strong>: Heather Duke underlined a lot of
things in this copy of The Catcher in the Rye, but I believe the word
Eskimo, underlined all by itself is the key to understanding Heather’s
pain.</p>
<p><strong>father ripper</strong>: On the surface, Heather Duke was the
vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. But her soul was in
Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can
be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so
eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. We’ll all miss
Sherwood’s little Eskimo. Let’s hope she’s rubbing noses with Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Is this turnout weak or what? I
had at least seventy more people at my funeral.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather? Wha…</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is
s-o-o boring. If I have to sing “Kumbaya” one more time…</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: What are you doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: I made your favorite. Spaghetti.
Lots of oregano.</p>
<p><strong>heather chandler</strong>: Dinner!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Dinner! Veronica! Dinner!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not the
F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A. That is to say, no one but me. I know
where J.D. is coming from and where he is heading. He’s wrong, but I’m
going to teach him what’s right. I’m going to stop J.D….If it’s the last
thing I do.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Does she want a written invitation? Veronica!
Dinner!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I can’t believe you did it. I was teasing. I
loved you. Sure, I climbed up here to kill you, but first I was going to
try and get you back. With amazing petition.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: It’s a shame you can’t see what our fellow
students really signed.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Listen. “We students of Westerburg High will
die. Today. Our burning bodies will be the ultimate protest to a society
that degrades is. Fuck you all.” Not that subtle but neither’s blowing
up the school. Talk about your suicide pacts. When our school explodes
tomorrow, it’s going to be the kind of thing that infects a generation.
A Woodstock for the 80’s. Damn, we coulda toasted marshmallows
together.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Honey, are you all right in there?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my baby back!
I should have let you keep that job at the mall. I was just afraid of
you coming home alone at night!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I made your favorite! Spaghetti! Lots of
oregano!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hey Mom, why so tense?</p>
<p><strong>fred dean</strong>: I need some help with my homework…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Sorry tiger, I’m a little busy….</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Veronica! J.D. told me you committed
suicide last night!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Where is he? Where’s J.D.?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We have to talk. Whether to kill yourself
is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Get a job.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Rodney, where’s everybody going?</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: It’s Friday…..</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Oh my God, the damn pep assembly….</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: Yeah, these things are pretty artificial,
but at least we all get out of class…</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Rodney, what’s underneath the gym?</p>
<p><strong>rodney</strong>: The boiler room.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: May I see your hall pass?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose
too loose! Goddamn you!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck
bomb in the boiler room that’ll set off a pack of thermals upstairs.
Okay, so let’s start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put
your hands on your head.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You didn’t say Simon Says.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Live by the sword…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You think just because you started this thing,
you can end it?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You, really didn’t think I’d, forget, forget,
to disconnect the….</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: The bomb’s gone on, J.D.! How do you turn
it off? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: It’s all over, J.D. Help me to stop
it.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I
do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody
loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let’s face it, the only
place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is
in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: How do you turn the fucker off?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You’re not listening. People are going to look
at the ashes of Westerburg and say there’s a school that self-destructed
not because society didn’t care, but because that school was society. Is
that deep or what? I’ll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of
charge.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: The bomb, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Just push the red button twice. That’s what
stops it. If that’s what you want, babe?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You know what I want, babe?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Cool guys like you out of my life.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: But babe, don’t worry, these here were Ich
Luge bullets.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Color me impressed.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You really fucked me up, Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I thought I…you..</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You’ve got power, Veronica. Power I didn’t
think you had. The slate is clean.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Pretend I did blow up the school. All the
schools. Now that you’re dead, what are you gonna do with your life?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Perfecto.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: Veronica, you look like hell.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yeah, I just got back.</p>
<p><strong>heather duke</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Heather, my love, there’s a new sheriff in
town.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Hey, Martha, wait up.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: My date for the prom kind of flaked out on
me, so I thought if you weren’t doing anything that night we could go to
the video store and rent some new releases or something. Maybe pop some
popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: So would I.</p>
