<h1 id="the-scarlet-letter">the-scarlet-letter</h1>
<p><strong>1 ext. village street long shot including church</strong>:
The Puritans are marching in solemn procession down the street toward
the church. The crime of laughter on Sunday is so severely punished that
no one ever dares nod a head in friendly salute as neighbors pass
neighbors. Life is vigorous and hard.</p>
<p><strong>3 semi close-up group of children</strong>: The children make
a comic picture as they march solemnly by with measured steps, their
frightened faces set in rigid masks, their eyes round and staring as
glass marbles. They look like little undertakers.</p>
<p><strong>5 int. hester prynne’s home</strong>: In her quiet room on
this gay morning, Hester Prynne, the little seamstress, makes ready for
church. She moves with fixed solemnity, her face as serious a mask as
the children’s who have just passed by. There is something quaint and
precise about her gestures. At first sight, she is all Puritan, filled
with firm resolves, pious, reserved. All this while she buttons herself
into her dove- grey dress, then draws her flowing hair back and binds it
into a tight, firm coil at her neck. It would be un-Christian if one
lock escaped. But when she comes to her bonnet, the eternal feminine is
revealed. A bonnet can throw a dreadful shadow over a face, or it can be
beautifully becoming. She places it upon her head. Shall she wear it
perched high, or well down over her eyes? Or perhaps just a wee bit to
one side? She really must see for herself. Cautiously she moves to the
wall, and stands before a framed worsted mat.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE-UP HESTER AT WALL:She regards the
worsted mat. On it is inscribed this warning from the scriptures:</p>
<p><strong>6 close-up hester</strong>: She practices how she will wear
her hat, and her eyes smile reflectively, for there is someone at church
who may look upon her, and she would meet with his approving glance.
Hester forgets it is Sabbath and smiles. It is entirely the fault of
that jaunty little hat. Something stirs within her, springtime–a longing
for life– and love, which is the fulfillment of life. She starts! The
church bells! She hears their warnings.</p>
<p><strong>8 semi close-up hester at mirror</strong>: Hester leans down
quickly to put the worsted mat over her mirror. Oh, that she should have
dared–and on the Sabbath, too! The vision of how charming the new bonnet
is warms her, and her mind is filled with material thoughts. The
reflection of the mirror stops on the bird cage that hangs by the
window. Hester, from where she is standing, sees the little imprisoned
bird. She puts the worsted mat back in place and starts toward the
window.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. hester’s house semi long shot</strong>: Hester moves
swiftly toward the open window, through which the light is streaming.
She seems conscious of the transition wrought within herself, aware,
perhaps for the first time of the prison which she has so long
endured.</p>
<p><strong>10 semi close-up at window</strong>: Close to the window is a
rustic cage with a bird in it. But a black shawl has been thrown over
the cage; for the bird’s song is forbidden to mount on the Sabbath. A
shaft of sunlight has fallen upon the cage. Hester’s face as she gazes
at the cage, becomes wistfully sad. Why should she hide its song, Hester
asks herself in this moment of faint rebellion. She draws the black
shawl away.</p>
<p><strong>11 close-up cage</strong>: The bird trilling his song.</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. hester prynne’s house</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>13 hester prynne’s window</strong>: Hester is listening to
the song of the bird. She makes a gay little figure framed in the dark
window.</p>
<p><strong>14 ext. hester prynne’s house</strong>: Mistress Hibbins, who
is the village gossip,–it is she who always points her finger in scorn
at Hester–urges one of the Puritans to mark Hester Prynne’s door. It is
she who says, with malicious intent:</p>
<p><strong>15 int. hester prynne’s house semi close-up window</strong>:
Hester opens the door of the cage and peeks in. “Good morning, little
prisoner!” with a merry smile. The bird is like the yellow shaft of an
arrow as he darts past her hand and out of the window. She gazes out of
the window, terrified that she has lost him. She looks out–sees the
bird–</p>
<p><strong>16 close-up puritan</strong>: A horrified expression on his
face–the bird has lit upon his shoulder. It flies off.</p>
<p><strong>17 int. hester’s house long shot</strong>: Hester hurries
out.</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. garden in rear of hester’s house</strong>: Hester
enters, running. She spins around and around, frantically searching for
some sight of her bird. Her hat is shading her eyes. Swiftly she pulls
it off and tosses it upon a bench. Then she runs out of the garden.</p>
<p><strong>19 close-up mistress hibbins</strong>: An exclamation of
horror is wrung from the old lady when the bird lights upon her
bonnet.</p>
<p><strong>20 garden of hester’s house semi close-up hester</strong>:
Hester’s lips are pursed as she whistles her call to the bird.</p>
<p><strong>22 semi long shot garden</strong>: Hester runs through the
garden and plunges into the thicket beyond.</p>
<p><strong>23 ext. hester prynne’s house</strong>: Mistress Hibbins and
the Stern Ones hear her calling–hear her daring to make strange
whistling sounds. They shake their heads solemnly. Mistress Hibbins is
triumphant! She can hardly wait to get to church and tattle to the
minister. Giles looks at her as if he would like to choke her.</p>
<p><strong>24 woods very long shot</strong>: Hester’s hair is now flying
loose–the wind stirs it–and her dress is caught in the brambles. A
little, disordered figure, running and searching the tree-tops.</p>
<p><strong>26 int. church</strong>: Mistress Hibbins, Giles, and the
Puritans enter the church. The women are seated on one side, the men on
the other. Giles stalks along and takes his place in a pew near the
pulpit and on the aisle. Mistress Hibbins, who is going to wait in the
vestry-room until the minister arrives so that she can tell on Hester,
bustles down the aisle toward the vestry. Giles sticks one of his long
legs out in the aisle and almost succeeds in tripping her.</p>
<p><strong>27 ext. deep woods</strong>: Hester running farther and
farther away from the church and the sound of the bells. Running rather
gaily now. She is calling–whistling–looking for the bird.</p>
<p><strong>29 int. vestry</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale is talking with
a few of his parishioners when Mistress Hibbins enters. Mistress Hibbins
fairly bustles with excitement, she does so love to have a tidbit of
gossip to impart. She begins:</p>
<p><strong>30 semi close-up reverend dimmesdale and mistress
hibbins</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale listens to Mistress Hibbins. “We
were passing Mistress Prynne’s house–she stood by the window–she
uncovered the bird–the bird sang–and then if she didn’t deliberately go
running after the bird! And if that wasn’t enough, Reverend Dimmesdale,
we heard her whistle.” The old lady purses up her lips and whistles–then
gives an imitation of Hester calling, “Come, birdie, birdie!” beckoning
to the bird.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. beautiful country long shot</strong>: Hester Prynne
is running now, a tiny figure against the pattern of tall trees. The
running has excited her. She enjoys this unexpected freedom. We see her
spin around, almost in pirouette, as she looks and calls and darts
toward the bird–one moment frightened with fear she has lost him, the
next moment laughing. The springtime of the year, the wind blowing her
hair, and she is surrounded by the holy beauty of nature.</p>
<p><strong>32 closer shot of hester</strong>: The bird has lit on the
branch of a flowering tree. Hester is creeping up to him; she is
breathless; her eyes are sparkling. She no longer suggests the precise
little Puritan girl–she is a sprite of the woods! Her dress is torn, her
hair is tumbled. The bird flies away from her outstretched hand.</p>
<p><strong>33 long shot</strong>: Hester is running again. All the
latent elfin joy in Hester Prynne has sprung into being. She does not
know that a group of Puritans, dark and grim as the silhouette of trees
through which they walk, have stopped to watch her.</p>
<p><strong>34 semi close-up group of puritans</strong>: They stop short,
aghast as they hear laughter and a woman’s song. They look off and see
Hester. What is Hester Prynne doing? To them it looks as if she were
dancing.</p>
<p><strong>35 semi long shot of hester</strong>: Hester is spinning
again in gay pirouette as she sees the bird here one moment, there the
next. Now she plunges laughingly into the flowering thicket.</p>
<p><strong>36 semi close-up group of puritans</strong>: The Puritans
gaze at each other in horror and set their lips–then hurry even faster
toward the church.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. church</strong>: The church is partially filled with
sour faced, straight backed people who sit there in terrible solemnity,
as though it would be a sin if anyone should think that they were about
to enjoy the service. The beadle, whom we shall name Jonathan Appletree,
walks through the aisles, carrying a long pole. A general movement in
the church. The Governor enters! A most important man, pompous, elegant
and dignified.</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. woods</strong>: Hester Prynne is running and now
laughing, so exhilarated is she by this unexpected release. She
sees–</p>
<p><strong>40 close-up branch of tree</strong>: The bird is singing.</p>
<p><strong>41 close-up hester</strong>: As Hester looks at the bird,
their comes to her the realization that freedom has brought happiness to
the bird. She will no longer try to capture him. She is breathless, her
eyes are dancing with happiness. She sees–</p>
<p><strong>42 sky and trees</strong>: The bird flying to freedom.</p>
<p><strong>43 long shot</strong>: Hester runs and waves a happy farewell
to the bird.</p>
<p><strong>45 ext. woods close-up hester</strong>: She has heard the
bells at last! She stops and listens to them with growing terror. She
looks about her bewildered, realizing that she is far from church. Her
torn dress! Her streaming hair! She starts to bind it as she hurries
past the camera.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. church semi long shot</strong>: Giles is now seated
in back of the Governor. The beadle walks down the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>47 semi close-up of the beadle</strong>: He carries his long
pole, intently eyeing the congregation for the slightest wayward
gesture.</p>
<p><strong>48 close-up shot of the congregation</strong>: Giles is
trying to sit there stiffly attentive. Then his face suddenly
convulses–we see him struggling not to sneeze. He makes a desperate
effort to hold it in. When he does sneeze, it is with such violence as
to startle the congregation. Not only that, but he has dared to sneeze
upon the Governor. The beadle leans over, and, with his long stick, raps
Giles smartly on the head. The Governor casts an upbraiding glance at
Giles. He feels his dignity has been ruffled by this unconscious, but
vulgar, gesture of Giles.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. vestry</strong>: Through the open door can be seen
the parishioners in their pews. The Puritans who had seen Hester in the
woods have arrived, and they are telling Reverend Dimmesdale of Hester
Prynne’s sin of dancing and running on the Sabbath.</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. hester prynne’s house</strong>: Hester Prynne who has
returned for her bonnet, is seen again as she hurries out of the house
putting on her bonnet. But there is no longer any happiness in her
movements. She is terrified. She knows now that she is late for church,
will be caught and undoubtedly punished!</p>
<p><strong>52 int. church long shot</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale steps
into his pulpit, and all the people quiet themselves, for service is
about to begin.</p>
<p><strong>53 ext. church</strong>: Hester, breathless, stands outside,
wondering if she dare enter the church; then she almost glides in,
earnestly praying that she will be able to slip into her pew
unnoticed.</p>
<p><strong>54 int. church close-up congregation and pulpit</strong>: The
backs of the parishioners are to the camera. Reverend Dimmesdale is in
the pulpit preaching. There is no soft, kindly light in his eyes. He
doesn’t talk to them of salvation, but his attitude shows that he is
condemning them for their sins. He stops for a moment, as his eyes sweep
over the congregation, because he catches sight of Hester.</p>
<p><strong>55 semi long shot showing the congregation</strong>: They are
facing the camera, which is in the direction of the pulpit. Looking
straight ahead, not daring to move or glance sideways, even out of the
corner of their eyes, they do not see Hester. She comes creeping into
the church, looking very little and child-like, in fact, quite like a
naughty child, praying she won’t be caught. But just as she is about to
slink into her pew, she gazes up at the minister and sees his piercing
eye upon her. When she drops down into a seat between two tall Puritans
with a third tall Puritan in front of her, she is almost lost to
sight.</p>
<p><strong>56 close-up reverend dimmesdale</strong>: He is quite
infuriated by Hester’s effort to escape punishment. “Hester Prynne!” and
he points a finger at her dramatically. “Thou hast sinned–and wouldst
try to hide thy shame! Child of the devil! Come before me that I might
advise thee and teach a lesson to my flock through thee!”</p>
<p><strong>57 close-up hester</strong>: His voice ringing out terrifies
her. It is like blows upon her. With a guilty look in her eyes, she
tries to force a wistful smile as she moves to rise.</p>
<p><strong>58 long shot of church</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale’s eyes
are like a brand upon Hester. His voice rises and thunders through the
church as he points a condemning finger at her. Trembling, she rises at
his command and moves slowly up the aisle toward his pulpit–until she
stands there, her head bowed in humility.</p>
<p><strong>59 semi close-up hester and reverend dimmesdale</strong>:
Still pointing his finger, he is crying out: “Woe unto him who disobeys
the inexorable laws of God’s Sabbath! On this, His day of worship, thou
hast listened to the voice of the devil calling thee! Thou hast run, and
sung, and danced with thy hair unloosened. And now dost thou stand
before my people in shame and humiliation?”</p>
<p><strong>60 longer shot of church</strong>: The minister is swept away
by his passionate denouncement of Hester. “Let this be a warning to
thee!” and he turns back dramatically to the congregation. “God is just
and merciful, but His punishment is swift and heavy upon the sinners who
yield themselves to petty vanities.”</p>
<p><strong>61 close-up hester</strong>: She raises her face toward him,
her eyes are filled with tears; but in them is a look so pitiful, so
pleading, that there is revealed the secret of Hester Prynne’s heart–she
is in love with the minister. Her eyes caress the stern face that bends
above her. His words are lost; she hears only his voice, the voice of
the man that she loves.</p>
<p><strong>62 close-up reverend dimmesdale</strong>: He is looking down
at Hester. He is still crying out, “Shame on thee, Hester Prynne, that
thou, a young girl of our village, hast broken the sacred laws! Shame on
thee!” And then it is that her eyes, so pitiful and pleading arrest him
in his dramatic protest against the sins of the flesh. And there comes
into his eyes a strange wonderment, as if he has become aware of
Hester’s love for him.</p>
<p><strong>63 semi close-up hester and reverend dimmesdale</strong>:
There is between these two a long exchange of tense, dramatic glances.
Reverend Dimmesdale, unconscious of everything save the presence of
Hester, bends close to her. And eyes look long into eyes they lean to.
It shocks him–this realization that Hester Prynne is in love with him.
And through what emotion is <em>he</em> passing? She is lovely to look
upon; there is something almost divine about her tenderness, so
forgiving is she. And how can he stand there and in cruel words denounce
her? What is stirring within his own heart? Could it be possible that
he, too, is awakened to response by that great love of hers?</p>
<p><strong>64 semi long shot of church</strong>: Almost in a daze, the
minister turns away from Hester. It takes a few seconds to gather
himself together before he can summon again that dynamic force which so
marked the beginning of his sermon. But he must not weaken in his firm
resolve; he must continue with his tirade. He turns away from Hester,
back to those Puritans, who bend their heads under the scourge of his
warnings.</p>
<p><strong>65 close-up hester prynne</strong>: The tears have never left
Hester Prynne’s eyes, but her faint smile reveals hidden ecstasies in
her heart.</p>
<p><strong>66 semi close-up pulpit</strong>: Hester’s back is to the
camera. Reverend Dimmesdale is preaching. Once again his face is set in
stern condemnation; but as he addresses the parishioners, his eyes stray
again toward Hester’s face. Now he looks at her as if he were afraid of
her, almost resentful that she has awakened the dormant emotion of love
in his heart.</p>
<p><strong>67 fade in int. reverend dimmesdale’s study</strong>: Through
the open window streams the sunlight. Reverend Dimmesdale sits there
poring over his Bible, making notes for sermons; but the thoughts of
Hester crowd out all thoughts of duty, and he sits there idly dreaming
and wondering how far this attraction will carry him. He presents a
romantic figure. As he gazes into space, he is startled by a white rose
being thrown in through the window. He picks up the rose, and we know at
once by his expression that he believes it was thrown to him by Hester.
A slight sigh escapes him.</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. reverend dimmesdale’s study</strong>: It isn’t
Hester, but Mistress Hibbins, who has thrown the rose, because there she
stands with the second rose in her hand and is about to toss it also
when Giles comes along. Rather sheepishly she hides the rose. The two
quarrel. Giles hates her so that he can hardly keep his hands from
reaching out and wringing her neck. Mistress Hibbins, switching her
skirts, walks away.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. reverend dimmesdale’s study</strong>: He is still
gazing dreamily at the rose. Now he goes to the window to peek out, to
catch Hester, to see her smiling, upturned face.</p>
<p><strong>70 close-up minister at window</strong>: He looks out,
expecting to see Hester–and he does! He gazes dramatically a short
distance away into the square–and this is what he sees:</p>
<p><strong>71 semi close-up stocks</strong>: The stocks are set close to
the bleak wall of the church. A bright ray of sunshine strikes full upon
Hester, a prisoner of the stocks. She is suffering now from slight
exhaustion, her head droops forward wearily. When she raises her eyes,
in them is a haggard look of one who has endured hours of discomfort.
Several Puritans passing by pay little heed to her. Punishment in stocks
is an ordinary event. Then comes Mistress Hibbins. Her nose is in the
air. She smirks triumphantly and switches her skirts as she sails
past.</p>
<p><strong>72 int. reverend dimmesdale’s study</strong>: Shocked, the
minister hurriedly leaves his study.</p>
<p><strong>73 long shot of square</strong>: The minister is seen
hurrying out of his house and up to the stocks.</p>
<p><strong>74 close-up wooden sign over the stocks</strong>: On it is
inscribed in old English script:</p>
<p><strong>punished for laughing and</strong>: SINGING ON THE
SABBATH.</p>
<p><strong>75 semi close-up at stocks</strong>: A dreadful weakness has
overcome Hester. Hearing footsteps approaching, she raises her head,
and, upon seeing the minister standing there staring at her aghast, she
speaks through scarcely moving lips, “Water.”</p>
<p><strong>76 longer shot</strong>: The minister hurries away to the
pump, not far from the church. He fills the small pewter mug with water,
and then turns and hurries back to Hester, dropping on his knees beside
her.</p>
<p><strong>77 street</strong>: A shot of Mistress Hibbins and Giles
seeing Reverend Dimmesdale administering aid to Hester.</p>
<p><strong>78 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: The
minister, sincerely touched by Hester’s suffering, kneels that he may
hold the cup of water to her lips. Again their eyes meet, hers filled
with a melting tenderness and forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>79 longer shot</strong>: The minister rises to his feet. He
looks about him, and sees, coming out of the meeting-house, the Governor
followed by the beadle and two other Puritans. The minister, eager for
Hester’s freedom, hurries over toward the steps of the
meeting-house.</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. meeting-house close shot of steps</strong>: The
Governor is slow, ponderous and wordy. His dignity is almost
exaggerated. The beadle thinks he is equally important. He carries with
him the keys to the stocks. The minister, in a few words, speaks to the
Governor about Hester; he points dramatically off scene, and asks for
her release.</p>
<p><strong>81 semi close-up stocks</strong>: The minister and the beadle
enter. As the beadle starts to put the key into the lock–</p>
<p><strong>82 semi close mistress hibbins and giles</strong>: They are
watching–Mistress Hibbins indignant because Hester is spared, Giles
delighted.</p>
<p><strong>83 semi close-up stocks</strong>: The minister raises Hester
to her feet. She is weak; her legs are stiff from sitting so long in
that rigid position. She totters slightly. Believing that she is going
to fall, he puts his arm around her to support her. She looks up at him
gratefully. Thus they exit toward her home.</p>
<p><strong>84 fade in ext. hester prynne’s house</strong>: Hester and
the minister have reached the house and are standing outside her door.
They are standing there in strange quiet, for Hester is still weak from
the ordeal through which she has passed. She holds out her hands and he
takes them both in his. His words are stern for he is saying:</p>
<p><strong>85 longer shot</strong>: The minister flies from Hester
because he is afraid of this love. Then he looks back. Another dramatic
pause; she is leaning forward over the little gate, looking after
him.</p>
<p><strong>86 close-up reverend dimmesdale</strong>: For one brief
moment he is carried away by an impulse to hurry back to her side,
perhaps even to declare his love. He is fighting with his innermost
conscience. Again that look of fear! He turns and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>87 semi close-up hester</strong>: Hester is gazing after the
minister. How deeply she loves him! How unashamed she is of this love!
And, though filled with infinite longing for him, there comes over her
an emotion of happiness; she is now aware that he is in love with her.
With this happiness singing in her heart, she hurries into the
house.</p>
<p><strong>88 int. hester’s home</strong>: Hester enters. She walks in
deep reverie.</p>
<p><strong>89 close-up reverend dimmesdale</strong>: As Reverend
Dimmesdale walks along in great strides, as if he were hurrying to
escape from the lure of Hester, we see his struggle to put her out of
his heart. Again he is afraid. He is saying to himself, “No–no, I cannot
let myself yield to material love.” For a moment he hates her; he hates
her for the acknowledgement of his own weakness; and then there comes
again a transition. It brings him to a sudden stop. There sweeps over
him a tender feeling for her, a longing to see her again–something of
the same ecstasy that Hester had known. His face is suddenly aglow with
beauty and softness. His eyes are deeply tender. He seems almost
overcome by this sudden rush of emotion.</p>
<p><strong>90 ext. dimmesdale’s house</strong>: Dimmesdale, walking
toward the door of his house, is in such a gaze that he doesn’t notice
Giles. Giles greets him happily and then stares after the minister
amazed, because the minister, with wide open eyes, walks like one in a
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>91 int. hester’s house</strong>: Hester is seated on a little
stool at work on a bridal veil. She is busy with her needle; for it is
she who makes the wedding veils for the village girls. Now she stops to
bite off a thread. When this is done, she holds it up and studies it,
pleased with the result. Now there comes to her a desire to try this
veil upon herself to see if it becomes her. She rises and goes to the
wall … where the hidden mirror is hung.</p>
<p><strong>92 semi close-up hester at mirror</strong>: Hester has again
set aside the worsted mat and is trying on the bridal veil.</p>
<p><strong>93 close-up hester</strong>: Hester’s eyes are filled with
loving memories of Reverend Dimmesdale as she gazes at herself in the
mirror, and she sighs as she draws her hand caressingly over the veil.
She whispers “Beloved,” her face leaning so close to the mirror that her
lips almost caress the reflection.</p>
<p><strong>94 int. reverend dimmesdale’s study</strong>: Reverend
Dimmesdale sitting there dreaming of Hester. His eyes reflect her own
thought of him.</p>
<p><strong>95 int. hester’s room semi close-up</strong>: Hester is
gazing dreamily into the mirror. Then there comes a complete transition
of her expression from ecstasy to fear. “No– no!” she cries aloud. “I
can never wear a bridal veil–never!” And with a dramatic gesture she
pulls the bridal veil from her head. Hester, who is married, knows that
she cannot wed Dimmesdale even though he should ask her. This thought
brings fear and sorrow to her. She looks down at the bridal veil, her
tears falling upon it.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. hester’s house</strong>: Giles is knocking at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. hester’s house</strong>: Hester tries to wipe away
her tears as she hurries to the door. She opens it and Giles enters.
Giles, who is grinning happily as he comes into the room, because he
likes Hester and is always glad to see her, stops short as he sees the
tears which she has not successfully wiped away. Hester, afraid that he
has seen them, drops down onto a little footstool and starts putting the
last stitch or two into the bridal veil, busying herself with her
work.</p>
<p><strong>98 close-up giles</strong>: His mouth drops open as he looks
upon Hester with ludicrous sympathy. “Hast thou a tear in thy eye?”
unconsciously indicating his own.</p>
<p><strong>99 close-up hester</strong>: As she continues sewing on the
veil, she forces a little smile, answering:</p>
<p><strong>100 semi close-up giles and hester</strong>: Hester rises to
show the veil to Giles. He handles it in his big clumsy hands, awkwardly
holding it out and grinning a sheepish, embarrassed grin. Hester clasps
her hands as she looks at the veil. When Giles sees her intent gaze upon
it, he suggests:</p>
<p><strong>101 fade in close-up covering the entire screen a volume of

over the pages.</p>
<p><strong>close-up of the governor</strong>: The Governor is studying
the book, peering through his huge spectacles at the page he has turned
to.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE-UP OF PAGE:This paragraph covers the
entire page:</p>
<p><strong>law for washing on monday</strong>: Nether garments of women
are necessary though immodest. They must be washed in secret and hidden
far from masculine eyes.</p>
<p><strong>102 ext. stream in the country long shot</strong>: It is
summer now. A lovely scene of the brook, the trees–and here and there
women washing their clothes.</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. lonely isolated bend in the stream</strong>: Hester
has found an isolated spot to do her washing. She rises from her knees
beside the brook, wrings out a pair of panties, then hurries away to
where she is hanging the nether-garments to dry.</p>
<p><strong>104 ext. limb of tree semi long shot</strong>: There is
hanging on the low branch of the tree a petticoat. Hester enters,
unwraps the article that she has brought with her, straightens them out
and starts to hang them up. When they are in place, with her fingers she
flutes the ruffle. While she is in the midst of doing this, she looks
up, startled. She hears–</p>
<p><strong>105 close-up minister’s feet</strong>: The feet come down
heavily on a fallen twig–and it snaps in two.</p>
<p><strong>106 semi close-up hester</strong>: With a little suppressed
cry of horror, she snatches the panties from the line and holds them in
back of her. The footsteps are approaching. She looks around,
bewildered, for some avenue of escape. And then that expression of
horror deepens when she sees …</p>
<p><strong>107 longer shot</strong>: Who should be walking along in
meditation as he reads from a small prayer book but Reverend Dimmesdale.
Hester tries to escape before he sees her, plunging behind a large
protective bush.</p>
<p><strong>108 close-up reverend dimmesdale</strong>: He has looked up
in time to see a woman running guiltily. He calls out to her:</p>
<p><strong>109 long shot of a clump of bushes</strong>: Drawing himself
up to a dignified height, Reverend Dimmesdale stalks over toward the
bush. Hester, hiding in back of it, is vainly trying to keep away from
him. The action almost resolves itself into a game of tag. He starts one
way–she runs around the other way. They keep this up, until, both
running, they find themselves face to face. Hester, with a wild, guilty
look in her eyes, holds the garment in back of her.</p>
<p><strong>110 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: The
minister is endeavoring to gaze at her sternly. “Hester Prynne, thou
hast a guilty look in thine eyes. Thou hast been sinning again!”</p>
<p><strong>111 longer shot</strong>: Hester is slowly backing away–her
eyes fixed on the minister’s face. His command rings out again. “Stop,
Hester! Thou art hiding something!”</p>
<p><strong>112 ext. wooded lane long shot</strong>: From a distance we
see the minister walking along, quite swiftly, away from Hester, his
gaze still upon the prayer-book that he holds in his hands. Then comes
the little figure of Hester running toward him until she is at his
side.</p>
<p><strong>113 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: The
minister with a most pious air tries to pretend that he doesn’t even see
Hester. She cannot keep up with his long strides. Sometimes she falls
behind and has to run to keep up with him. Then with mock seriousness,
she steps out with long strides to mate his own footsteps. He looks up,
pretending surprise, nods to her rather curtly, then glances straight
ahead of him. But at that he is rather pleased, for the Reverend
Dimmesdale, though he would deny it himself, is seriously in love with
Hester. And as they walk, they look toward each other again, the
minister trying to preserve an air of dignity and slight disapproval
that she should make so bold as to persist in talking to him.</p>
<p><strong>114 ext. country very long shot</strong>: We see fading away
into the distance, until they are lost in the silhouette of trees, the
minister and Hester.</p>
<p><strong>115 fade in ext. country at brook</strong>: This is a
beautiful location. Its beauty plays a part in the story, because years
later Hester and the minister return to this scene of the first
declaration of their love.</p>
<p><strong>116 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: Hester’s eyes
as they search Reverend Dimmesdale again betray the great love that she
feels for him. Again he is stirred profoundly, though always there is
within him that constant struggle against all emotional expression.
Hester, who loves deeply, loves unreservedly, and has neither false
pride nor false modesty. She bends close to him. Her eyes pleading that
he care for her, willing to yield herself to the glowing joy of love
that she may find a sacred happiness in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>117 longer shot</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale springs to his
feet. He hurries from Hester. But Hester does not move. She sits there
quietly in a shaft of light that pierces through the tall trees,
divinely happy because his eyes have told her that he loves her.</p>
<p><strong>118 close-up reverend dimmesdale</strong>: He stands there
struggling against all these years of discipline– against emotional
outlet. His face is tense and set.</p>
<p><strong>119 close-up hester</strong>: Her eyes are filled with
dreams. She waits happily as if she knew that he would return to
her.</p>
<p><strong>120 long shot</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale walks swiftly
back to Hester, falls on his knees before her, draws her into his arms,
and kisses her with a fierce tenderness.</p>
<p><strong>121 close-up hester and reverend dimmesdale</strong>: Again
and again he kisses her, whispering to her passionate words of love;
because once a man of his nature releases himself to a great physical
emotion, all restraint is torn away; he knows no barriers; it becomes a
terrific, hysterical release.</p>
<p><strong>122 fade in ext. village street night winter</strong>: A
light snow is falling. The village is plunged in darkness except for the
lights from a few windows.</p>
<p><strong>123 int. beadle’s house</strong>: In this plain, somber
living-room filled with only the barest necessities of furniture, Giles
is courting Patience, the girl of his heart. The two of them are seated
on a long wooden bench, making love by talking to each other through a
long speaking tube. A fire flickers in the fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>124 semi close-up giles and patience (akeley</strong>: SHOT
FROM ONE TO ANOTHER) Patience is a typical Puritan girl who, unlike
Hester, has no springtime in her heart. Mechanically she obeys all the
prescribed laws. Giles has asked her father for her hand in marriage,
and has been accepted. So now he is trying to whisper sweet nothings
through the speaking tube into her ears.</p>
<p><strong>125 longer shot</strong>: The beadle looks at his heavy
watch, raps on the Bible and tells Giles it is time he left. Giles
reluctantly reaches for his tall hat– and she leads the way to the door.
Giles looks up and sees that the beadle is engrossed with his Bible.
With a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, Giles watches his chance, bends
over and kisses her chastely upon the cheek. An outcry from the girl as
she draws back in horror. Father and Mother both rise and march over to
them. The stern old beadle denounces Giles, and the girl then and there
refuses to marry Giles, exclaiming with great dignity and righteous
wrath:</p>
<p><strong>126 long shot of market-place in the snow</strong>: Giles,
crossing the market-place, passes the meeting-house. The door opens and
the minister comes out.</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. meeting-house closer shot</strong>: Through the
lighted door we can see into the room. There sits the Governor and two
or three of the Puritans. Reverend Dimmesdale hurries out and closes the
door after him. Giles and the minister pass, exchanging a brief
greeting. The minister hurries on toward Hester’s house.</p>
<p><strong>128 ext. showing hester’s house</strong>: The minister going
toward Hester’s house. A group of Puritans pass and the minister is
forced to step into the shadows until they are gone from sight.</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. corner of market-place</strong>: Giles passes the
old man who rings the curfew bell for “Lights out!” The old fellow
carries a huge lantern in one hand and a bell in the other. We can see
by his expression that he is saying, “Why out so late, Giles? Hurry on
thy way home! Be gone–I will soon be ringing the bell.”</p>
<p><strong>130 int. hester’s house</strong>: Hester is seated before the
fireplace at the loom. The quiet room is made interesting by the glow of
candlelight. Hester is spinning her thread preparatory to weaving.</p>
<p><strong>131 ext. hester’s house</strong>: The snow is fast piling
upon the eaves. Reverend Dimmesdale enters quickly, gliding into the
shadows for fear that he might be seen. The door is opened slightly–a
chink of light shows that Hester is standing there. She opens the door
wide enough to admit Dimmesdale, who enters, then the door is closed
after him.</p>
<p><strong>132 int. hester’s home</strong>: The minister’s face is aglow
with a new interest. After their embrace, she looks toward him to know
what has caused his strange, almost happy, animation. And he tells her
eagerly:</p>
<p><strong>133 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: He laughs
almost boyishly, as if it pleased him a little to tease her; and then
his voice lowers to a caressing note as he explains how she is to share
his happiness:</p>
<p><strong>134 longer shot</strong>: The minister stares at her
incredulously for a few moments as she drops on her knees before a
small, worn trunk. She opens it and rummages through its treasures until
she finds a little leather bag. She dumps its contents upon the floor
and searches until she has found a ring, a plain, broad wedding-ring.
She picks it up, and carries it to Dimmesdale.</p>
<p><strong>135 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: Hester holds
the ring before him; it lies in the palm of her outstretched hand. He
stares at it for a few moments and cannot quite understand.</p>
<p><strong>136 longer shot</strong>: He turns with bowed head to leave
her, as if he could not endure any longer an intimacy that had been
sacred to him until this shadow had been thrown upon it. Why must he
leave with this sorrow in his heart? She hurries to the door and stops
him.</p>
<p><strong>137 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: She clings to
him. “O my darling!” she cries, “do not leave me at such a shadowed
hour. I love thee. It is my love which has betrayed thee. Parting from
thee is twisting my heart with pain!” He hears the caress of her voice,
he feels the warmth of her arms. He turns back to her, conscious only of
his love for her. Again there is pleading in her voice.</p>
<p><strong>138 street night snowing</strong>: The old man is ringing the
bell which warns the villagers, “Lights out!”</p>
<p><strong>139 ext. village street night snow</strong>: The lights in
the windows blink out.</p>
<p><strong>140 int. hester’s house</strong>: The two are standing by the
door. The curfew has brought them back to sudden consciousness. He must
leave, hurriedly! He cups her face in his hands, and his gaze plunges
deep into her eyes. He studies her intently as if to photograph
indelibly upon his memory every detail of her beloved face. Then,
without a farewell pressure of lips upon lips, he turns and hurries away
while he still has the courage to leave her. When he is gone, she stands
there staring after him–her body poised for flight. Then there comes
flooding over her the realization that he is gone–that she is going to
bring into the world a child–and that she must face this tragedy
alone!</p>
<p><strong>141 longer shot</strong>: She sweeps open the door.</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. hester’s house</strong>: In the lighted doorway, we
can see Hester. She runs out into the snow, beckoning, “Come back! Come
back!” … But he is already gone. She stops. She cannot let him know–she
cannot send him away with this burden on his heart. She turns back into
the house and closes the door after her.</p>
<p><strong>143 int. hester’s house</strong>: Hester seems white and
drawn and her eyes are flaming with budding terror. At last when her
emotion has reached a crisis she cries out, “O Lord forgive me–and make
Thine eyes to shine upon me in my hour of travail and repentance!”</p>
<p><strong>144 fade in volume of laws of the colony</strong>: The
Governor’s hand again enters–turns over the pages.</p>
<p><strong>145 close-up page</strong>: On this page in large, legible
type is written:</p>
<p><strong>146 ext. market-place long shot</strong>: The scaffold stands
in grim, bleak silhouette against the barren walls of the church. At the
base of the scaffold are quiet groups of Puritans. They look almost as
forbidding as the scaffold itself. Many Puritans are marching solemnly
toward it. The whole picture suggests something grim and terrible.</p>
<p><strong>147 int. meeting-house semi long shot</strong>: The Governor
and several funereal looking Puritans are in the meeting-house. Their
eyes reflect the solemn occasion. They are trudging down the steps,
their faces almost expressionless, when one looks through the window.
There is a flare of excitement when he points off scene, “Look Reverend
Dimmesdale is returning!”</p>
<p><strong>148 ext. market-place semi long shot</strong>: Reverend
Dimmesdale on horseback is riding toward the meeting-house. As he passes
the camera his face is aglow, for he brings them good news. His eyes are
lit with other fires–he is soon to see Hester!</p>
<p><strong>149 int. meeting-house</strong>: The Governor and the
Puritans, in their eagerness to greet the minister, have forgotten the
solemnity of the occasion. Their faces are now wreathed in smiles and he
enters and hurries over to them.</p>
<p><strong>150 closer shot of group</strong>: After the greeting is
over, Reverend Dimmesdale tells them with eager enthusiasm:</p>
<p><strong>151 ext. foot of scaffold semi long shot</strong>: There
stands on the scaffold a Puritan with face like an executioner. He is
the drummer. Very solemnly he raises his sticks and beats the drum. It
is a call to arms.</p>
<p><strong>152 int. meeting-house semi close up governor,
reverend</strong>: DIMMESDALE AND PURITANS The ominous sound of the drum
has arrested them.</p>
<p><strong>153 int. prison cell long shot</strong>: It is a grim, bleak,
formidable prison. Huge spiked doors. A high-barred window through which
streams a path of daylight. In a rough cradle lies Hester’s baby. Hester
sits there on a little stool, gazing straight ahead, her supine hands in
her lap, no light coming into her great eyes which are dull, almost
expressionless. Eyes that are like ghosts of a remote sorrow. All
emotion seems whipped from her, so much has she suffered. Her gestures
are eloquent of her utter abandonment of hope. She has already endured
so much she gives the impression that life has passed her by and nothing
will ever be able to hurt her again. She sits there staring down at the
baby. Once she leans over to pick some little piece of lint from off the
woven coverlet, or to draw her finger lightly over the sleeping child’s
face.</p>
<p><strong>154 ext. prison</strong>: The beadle protests slightly about
Reverend Dimmesdale’s entering the prison, but his protests are waved
aside.</p>
<p><strong>155 int. hester’s prison cell close-up</strong>: Hester hears
footsteps and voices outside. She glances dully toward the door,
wondering if the guards have come for her.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. hester’s cell</strong>: The warden has opened the
door. Reverend Dimmesdale enters and stands there staring transfixed at
Hester. So stunned is he that he makes no perceptible move.</p>
<p><strong>157 close-up hester</strong>: So much has Hester suffered
that one feels her reactions are not quite normal. She stares at
Reverend Dimmesdale through veiled eyes, almost as if she were not quite
certain that it is he, as if she could not believe that he had really
come to her at last.</p>
<p><strong>158 longer shot</strong>: It is when the door is closed by
the warden and these two are alone that an agonized cry is wrung from
the heart of the minister, “Hester!”</p>
<p><strong>159 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: The tears
have dried in Hester’s heart–they do not well to her eyes. It is the
minister who breaks down completely. He is sobbing, “O Hester, canst
thou ever forgive me? I never dreamed but that thou wert happily waiting
for me. Oh, what thou must have suffered. And I, free, unpunished,
allowed to walk in God’s sunshine, while thou art doomed to a prison
cell–”</p>
<p><strong>160 longer shot</strong>: As he starts toward the door,
Hester runs to him and clings to him. With all her heart she is pleading
with him to hold to this silence in protection of others, crying
out:</p>
<p><strong>161 close-up of drum beating</strong>: The ominous sound of
the muffled drum is dramatic preparation for Hester’s entrance from
prison and her march to the scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>162 int. hester’s prison cell</strong>: Hester’s back is to
the camera. The guard is standing there watching her. Hester’s movements
indicate that she is pinning something upon her breast, but we do not
see what it is. Then she lifts the sleeping child from out its cradle
and holds it against her breast. And when she turns around, her badge of
shame is not revealed.</p>
<p><strong>163 int. meeting-house</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale enters
the meeting-house. His face is white and drawn.</p>
<p><strong>164 ext. prison gates</strong>: The prison gates are opened.
Two guards march out, huge, solemn- looking men who suggest
executioners. Then Hester comes, slowly, carrying her child upon her
breast. Though her face is marked with suffering, she holds her head
high with fine sweeping pride; for soon she is to pass through the
crowds who will point their fingers at her.</p>
<p><strong>165 ext. balcony of meeting-house</strong>: The Governor, the
beadle, and several Puritans stand out on this balcony, which is
parallel with the scaffold. It is from there, over the heads of the
people, that the Governor will call out Hester’s sentence. The minister
joins them there. A fearful change is wrought in him. His eyes are stark
and staring; his face looks haggard; a dreadful weakness has come over
him. He is staring down at the foot of the scaffold where he sees
Hester, the martyr, reviled by the villagers who have gathered there to
witness the consummation of her shame.</p>
<p><strong>166 ext. scaffold semi long shot</strong>: As Hester marches
through the crowd to the scaffold, they stand there, grave, disturbed
with hatred of her.</p>
<p><strong>167 closer shot of hester</strong>: Mistress Hibbins cackles
and points her fingers. “Adultress!” she screams in her high, shrill
voice.</p>
<p><strong>168 close-up balcony of meeting-house</strong>: There is a
certain satisfaction to the Governor and the beadle, who have ordered
this punishment, to see how much the sinner is enduring. They exchange
pompous and dignified glances. The more pain and sorrow she endures, the
better example she will be to the other women of the village. Interested
in their own reactions, they do not notice the tragic figure of the
minister as, in agony, he watches Hester.</p>
<p><strong>169 long shot of the village square</strong>: Hester has now
mounted to the scaffold and is standing there, her child held close to
her breast. All the villagers are gathered around the scaffold. On the
balcony, even from this distance, can be seen the Governor, the minister
and the beadle.</p>
<p><strong>170 ext. balcony</strong>: Dimmesdale is staring at Hester,
distraught. The Governor turns to him and is apparently unconscious of
the dreadful expression on his face. He insists to the minister:</p>
<p><strong>171 close-up scaffold</strong>: Hester with pitiful dignity
stands there holding her child in her arms. Now she looks over and sees
Dimmesdale on the balcony– his eyes almost on a level with hers. And
again there comes to her the fear that he will reveal himself.</p>
<p><strong>172 semi close-up balcony of meeting-house</strong>: Reverend
Dimmesdale steps forward. “Hester Prynne,” he cries out, “I charge thee
to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer!”</p>
<p><strong>173 ext. scaffold and balcony semi long shot</strong>: This
shot is to establish that the crowds standing around the scaffold now
turn from Hester, who has held their attention, to the minister, whose
voice, ringing out to Hester, holds them. His gestures very clearly show
that he is speaking to Hester. And it is across the heads of the
multitude that Hester and the minister play their dramatic love scene,
wherein Hester tells to him, whose ears alone understand, the depth and
beauty of her love; wherein his words of pity and sympathy make known to
her the tragic tenderness that he feels.</p>
<p><strong>174 semi close-up of balcony</strong>: Dimmesdale, struggling
with his own emotion, inwardly praying that she will point her finger at
him and free him from his struggle with his own conscience, beseeches
her:</p>
<p><strong>175 close-up hester</strong>: Hester has never loved so
deeply as at this moment; her eyes are caressing his face. A faintness
overcomes her. She smiles with lovely tenderness. The hand of the baby
reaching up plucks at her mouth. Then Hester glances down at the child,
and the smile deepens. Once more her eyes are upon him. Her voice
carries over to him this message of her heart:</p>
<p><strong>176 close-up of balcony</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale stands
there as one who walks, eyes open, in a deep sleep. He cannot speak. He
can only bow his head. And when he looks up again, tears glisten in his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>177 long shot showing the scaffold, the crowd and the
balcony</strong>: The gaze of the Puritans turns from the minister to
Hester– and back to the minister again. They are rather moved by the low
cadences of those voices, though the meaning of the words is too deep
for them to understand.</p>
<p><strong>178 close-up at scaffold</strong>: A beautiful light seem to
fall upon Hester’s face, the light of love, as she calls across the
heads of the people to him in words that are almost a prayer:</p>
<p><strong>179 semi close-up balcony</strong>: So broken is the minister
by now, so crushed is his spirit, that he cannot speak again. The
Governor infers from his bowed head that the minister is sorrowful
because he has not made Hester confess. Now it is he who steps forward.
A pompous man who enjoys his power and his position, he clears his
throat before he makes this peroration: “Hester Prynne, thou art a
sinner! Thou art a wanton and a fallen woman–and I stand before thee to
mete out thy punishment!”</p>
<p><strong>180 semi long shot pillory crowd and balcony</strong>: There
is a movement among the crowd, an eager pressing forward. The Governor’s
words, “I shall mete out thy punishment,” hold their attention. Some are
looking at Hester; some are waiting almost breathlessly for the Governor
to give his orders.</p>
<p><strong>181 close-up balcony</strong>: The agony of the minister is
increasing. He stands in back of the Governor as the latter, pointing to
Hester, cries out:</p>
<p><strong>182 close-up hester</strong>: Slowly, Hester lowers the child
that is in her arms. On her breast is the scarlet letter “A” for
adultery.</p>
<p><strong>183 ext. square long shot</strong>: A very definite reaction
on the crowd. Now they can let loose their jeers, their hisses, their
revilements. They can cry “For shame, Hester Prynne! Look at her–the
branded woman!”</p>
<p><strong>184 close-up hester</strong>: Like a martyr Hester stands
there. The little hand of the baby now tugs at the letter “A.” Hester is
looking up as if inwardly she were praying for strength to endure her
sorrow and humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>185 fade in int. reverend dimmesdale’s study night</strong>:
It is night, and a flickering candle casts interesting shadows about the
room. Reverend Dimmesdale is alone in his study with that grim shadow,
“Conscience.” He paces up and down the floor, up and down, up and down,
his mind so disturbed that his body cannot be at rest. He pauses before
an iron cross hanging on the wall and stands regarding it tensely. Then
he is drawn out of his absorption by the sound of footsteps hurrying
by–and he turns toward the window to see:</p>
<p><strong>186 street night ext. prison (shooting through the window
in</strong>: REVEREND DIMMESDALE’S STUDY) A group of Puritans marching
toward the prison. In the light of the torches which they bear, their
faces appear weird and fanatical. They are bent on some secret
mission.</p>
<p><strong>187 int. reverend dimmesdale’s study close-up
rev.reverend</strong>: DIMMESDALE AT WINDOW A wild light comes into his
eyes as he watches them pass. Can it be that they have found some other
means of torturing the woman that he loves? He has seen her endure too
much already; the frail craft would break under any more torture.</p>
<p><strong>188 int. hester’s prison cell long shot</strong>: Hester is
sitting there nursing her baby; its little face rests against the
scarlet letter. She lays the child in its cradle. It is night. Only a
tall, flickering candle lights the gloom of the darkened cell. Suddenly,
without warning to Hester, and she is shocked by it, the prison doors
swing open, and there marches into the room the group of Puritans we
have just seen passing through the street. Among them is Mistress
Hibbins. She alone cackles and crows over Hester and looks at her with
sly, meaningful glances; the others are cold and silent.</p>
<p><strong>189 close-up group of puritans</strong>: Among this group is
Mistress Hibbins; but it isn’t she who speaks. It is the beadle whose
very coldness of manner is terrifying. He says:</p>
<p><strong>190 semi close-up hester</strong>: Hester listens. She has
heard that dreadful sentence, which for a moment leaves her too stunned
to make protest.</p>
<p><strong>191 longer shot</strong>: The beadle takes a step toward the
cradle. Hester springs in front of it protectingly. Now it is that the
grief she has kept pent-up within her is unleashed. She pleads–pitiful,
heart- breaking pleading–her body racked with sobs.</p>
<p><strong>192 semi close-up hester</strong>: In the flickering light of
the candle, Hester’s staring eyes are those of a mad woman. Her face is
distorted with terror and rage. “Stand back!” she screams again, “or I
will tear thee limb from limb! I will tear the hearts out of thy bodies!
I would make thee suffer as thou hast crucified me! Stand back!”</p>
<p><strong>193 semi close-up puritans</strong>: Even Mistress Hibbins is
silenced by Hester’s eyes, blazing with a fury that is close to madness.
There is no perceptible move.</p>
<p><strong>194 long shot</strong>: But just as they are galvanized into
action and make to surround Hester, Reverend Dimmesdale enters the cell,
pushes his way through them, hurling them to one side with a force that
is born of despair, until he stands before Hester, ready to protect her.
His voice echoes Hester’s frantic command, “Stand back!” There is
something so compelling in the fiery eyes of their minister that they
move toward the door and stand shame-faced before him. Some of them
shuffle their feet and look about uneasily. “Shame on thee that thou
wouldst attack a helpless woman!” The minister’s voice is broken with
compassion for her.</p>
<p><strong>195 semi close-up the minister and hester</strong>: Hester
holds her baby against her breast, her arms fearfully around her, ready
to shield her.</p>
<p><strong>196 semi close-up group of puritans</strong>: Mistress
Hibbins, cackling to herself, dares to break the silence. She is
pointing toward the baby:</p>
<p><strong>197 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: They had
never thought of this before. A nameless brat! This child, so sacred in
their eyes, must be branded “a nameless brat” in the eyes of the world.
There is tragic pathos in his voice when he speaks to Hester:</p>
<p><strong>198 longer shot</strong>: At this news there is general
protest from the assembled crowd. But the minister raises his hand
commanding silence, and they obey him. Then he orders Hester to stand
forward under the glow of light. She holds the child in her arms and
faces him. He looks around for water, which is one of the properties of
baptism. On the crude table in the room, or perhaps by the cradle of the
child, is a pewter mug with water in it. This he takes an places near
him, or asks one of the Puritans to hold. He reaches for the child and
holds it tenderly in his own arms while he baptizes it.</p>
<p><strong>199 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: “Hester
Prynne, what wouldst thou name thy child?” he asks. Hester, gazing down
at the child, answers quietly:</p>
<p><strong>200 semi long shot</strong>: It is a simple ceremony, this
baptism. The minister dips his fingers in the water and then upon the
head of the baby, as he says: “I name thee Pearl, in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p><strong>201 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: The
minister prays with a fervor that tells of the agony of his own soul.
Hester, deeply touched, weeps silently. Her burning tears fall upon the
baby’s upturned face.</p>
<p><strong>202 close-up baby’s head</strong>: One of Hester’s tears
falls upon the baby’s cheek. It laughs. When the second tear drops upon
its lips, the baby’s little tongue licks it off.</p>
<p><strong>203 close-up hester and the baby</strong>: Hester looks down
at the baby. This little funny gesture of the baby’s which will
undoubtedly make the audience laugh, makes Hester laugh, strange,
terrible, hysterical laughter which is born of sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>204 long shot</strong>: Laughter is a ghastly thing in this
grim, dank prison cell. Hysterical laughter, which has a note of madness
in it, sends the cold chills down their spines as they, still kneeling,
look up at her in horror. Even the minister steps back from her, aghast,
though realizing that it is laughter born of Hester’s broken spirit.</p>
<p><strong>205 fade in int. hester’s house long shot</strong>: Hester is
sitting by the window. She wears a dark dress. It is somber work sewing
on black palls. The child is the only bright, fantastic element close to
her. She comes dancing toward her mother, seizing her by the hand and
trying to draw her out into the garden. Hester shakes her head and,
indicating her work, says that she cannot leave.</p>
<p><strong>206 close-up hester and the child</strong>: There is an
intense love between these two. Hester looks down into the little
laughing face and bends to embrace her. Her eyes search the child with
sweeping tenderness. She brushes her hair back from her forehead; she
makes a little spit-curl on one cheek. She scrutinizes the child’s ears
to make certain they are clean. She takes a handkerchief and blows the
child’s nose. Then she says triumphantly, “Thou art ready for play.”</p>
<p><strong>207 ext. hester’s house semi long shot</strong>: The minister
is passing Hester’s house. We note at once the shocking change in him.
He is haggard–his eyes are sunken in their sockets. He looks like a man
who has suffered a severe illness.</p>
<p><strong>208 close-up of window</strong>: Hester bends forward with a
sharp intake of breath as she sees the minister passing. There is mute
recognition, an exchange of tragic looks between the two. The child,
curious to see what has attracted her attention, peeks out at the
minister.</p>
<p><strong>209 ext. hester’s house</strong>: The minister hesitates. He
looks with dumb pain toward Hester and the child. His hand goes over his
heart as though it were twisting and torturing him.</p>
<p><strong>210 int. hester’s house semi close-up hester and the
child</strong>: The sight of the man she loves leaves Hester faint,
almost overcome fro the moment. Her eyes close wearily. Then her mind is
brought to sharp focus by the voice of her child.</p>
<p><strong>211 ext. hester’s house</strong>: A group of youngsters go
hurrying by. Pearl, like all youngsters, runs and climbs on the gate.
“Good morning to thee!” she calls. They stand there staring at
her–arrogant little Puritans who stare, point scornfully, then without a
word rush away from her.</p>
<p><strong>212 close-up pearl</strong>: The child’s eyes widen; for a
moment she almost yields to a desire to cry; then she sets her little
jaw, presses her lips together, and cries, “Scat, or I’ll pepper you
with prickly burrs!”</p>
<p><strong>213 ext. of house longer shot</strong>: Pearl is now ready to
do battle. She is a wild little sprite. She sits perched up on the fence
and watches a group of Puritans who are walking toward her. Among them
is Mistress Hibbins. They are on their way to the meeting-house.</p>
<p><strong>214 close-up pearl</strong>: The child’s face flushes with
anger. She hates Mistress Hibbins. She casts them one threatening look,
then starts to climb down the fence.</p>
<p><strong>215 longer shot</strong>: Close to the fence, in a
hiding-place under some leaves, is Pearl’s little store of prickly
burrs.</p>
<p><strong>216 close-up puritan</strong>: A well-aimed burr perches on
top of his hat.</p>
<p><strong>217 close-up pearl</strong>: She throws another burr.</p>
<p><strong>218 close-up mistress hibbins</strong>: The burr has caught
in her hair behind her ear. She cries out with pain and rage, and shakes
a threatening finger at the child.</p>
<p><strong>219 semi long shot</strong>: Pearl is laughing as she sees
the Puritans running to escape this little, but deadly, enemy of theirs.
She doesn’t notice that the children have returned and are creeping
close to the fence. In their outstretched hands are piles of mud.</p>
<p><strong>220 close-up group of children</strong>: They are creeping
toward the camera, which is in the direction of Pearl, and we see what
they are going to do–throw mud at the child. One little boy swings his
arm and lets the mud-cake fly past the camera.</p>
<p><strong>221 close-up pearl</strong>: The mud catches Pearl on the
side of the face. She wheels around, startled.</p>
<p><strong>222 longer shot</strong>: Pearl jumps from the fence and runs
over to where are the prickly burrs. She begins hurling these at the
children while they, in turn, throw the mud, covering her from head to
foot with it.</p>
<p><strong>223 int. hester’s house</strong>: Hester is folding the pall
when she hears the outcries of the children. She springs to her feet,
lays her work to one side, and hurries out.</p>
<p><strong>224 ext. rear of hester’s house</strong>: Pearl is standing
there, a spraddle-legged, tempestuous figure, slinging the burrs at her
enemies. Some of the children are still throwing mud, and Pearl is
covered from head to foot. Hester, frightened, comes running out and up
to Pearl. At sight of her, most of the children fly, but one little boy
waits, ducks, and hides. He is going to let Hester have a handful of
it.</p>
<p><strong>225 close-up little boy</strong>: The boy has a malicious
face. He studies his aim for a moment, then throws a pile of mud.</p>
<p><strong>226 close-up hester and pearl</strong>: Hester has dropped on
her knees beside Pearl. She is gazing at the child aghast. The mud comes
into the scene, striking Hester full in the breast, half-covering the
letter “A.” Pearl is crying.</p>
<p><strong>227 int. vestry of church</strong>: Several of Reverend
Dimmesdale’s parishioners are there to see him about church duties. He
is trying to hide the ravages of grief and troubled conscience that have
just been made by the sight of Hester and the child. He is surrounded by
his people, who look upon him with eyes filled with an awed love and
respect. Their attitude toward him will make it very evident that to
them there is something very saint-like about him.</p>
<p><strong>228 int. hester’s home</strong>: A small wooden tub sits
before the fireplace. Hester has just washed Pearl and is now helping
the child into her shirt when she turns, hearing a knock upon the
door.</p>
<p><strong>229 ext. hester’s house</strong>: A funeral group of three
men. They have come there for the pall. One is knocking on the door.</p>
<p><strong>230 int. hester’s house</strong>: Hester reaches for a shawl,
wraps it quickly around Pearl, and opens the door. The men enter. Hester
greets them pleasantly, but they make no response. Their gestures are
stiff, and their words few. “Mistress Prynne, is the pall ready?”</p>
<p><strong>231 close-up window</strong>: The profile of the child
peering out of the window. In the garden beyond can be seen those wicked
children creeping into the yard after Pearl’s store of burrs.</p>
<p><strong>232 semi long shot of the room</strong>: While Hester is
folding the pall and the men are waiting, we see Pearl with one eye on
her mother, crawl out of the window. The shawl gets caught on the sill
and is left there.</p>
<p><strong>233 ext. rear garden</strong>: The children have their hands
full of her store of prickly burrs before they see Pearl descending upon
them like a raging little fury. They fly before her. When she discovers
that they have taken her treasures, she forgets everything. She forgets
the garb she is in, or else doesn’t care, and starts in pursuit of
them.</p>
<p><strong>234 int. hester’s home</strong>: The men are leaving with the
pall. When the door is closed, Hester turns back to speak to Pearl. She
looks around, surprised, and then startled, to find her gone. She peeks
around the bench, looks into the closet, believing, of course, that the
child must be hiding.</p>
<p><strong>235 ext. village street</strong>: The children, running past
the camera. In back of them runs Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>236 ext. rear of hester’s house</strong>: Hester comes
hurrying out, looking around for Pearl. She is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>237 long shot of village square</strong>: The naughty little
girl, attired only in her shirt, is running down the main street toward
the market-place, the children screaming and flying before her. Oh, what
a commotion it makes! How shocked those Puritan women are!</p>
<p><strong>238 semi close-up</strong>: The back of Pearl is to the
camera. In this shot the children running ahead of her can be seen.</p>
<p><strong>239 ext. village square showing the scaffold</strong>: The
Puritans are horrified. Now Pearl chases the children around the
scaffold. She leans down to pick up rocks and fling them at them.</p>
<p><strong>240 ext. church</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale is just coming
out of the church. He is astonished to see coming toward him, on a dead
run, three or four children, pursued by Pearl. The children run around
him as if seeking protection from Pearl, who, like a little witch,
chases them. Once as she runs around him, she catches hold of his coat,
darting in back of him–from one side to the other. He turns as if to
protect her and catches her in his arms. Here Mistress Hibbins
enters.</p>
<p><strong>241 semi close-up reverend dimmesdale and mistress hibbins
and pearl</strong>: The minister is trying to quiet the child, assuring
her that he isn’t going to harm her, but protect her. She, terrified,
not understanding, is kicking at him, trying to free herself. Her terror
increases when she sees Mistress Hibbins in back of her. Now she manages
to free herself. Mistress Hibbins, pointing at her, spits after her:
“Child of sin! Child of the devil–in the devil’s own garb!”</p>
<p><strong>242 ext. village street long shot</strong>: Hester, hurrying
down the street in search of Pearl. She catches sight of her as she
scoots across the square.</p>
<p><strong>243 ext. pool of water near the scaffold</strong>: The child
runs through it, splashing the water as she makes for a hiding place
under the steps of the pillory.</p>
<p><strong>244 close-up steps of pillory</strong>: The child huddles
under the steps. She is shivering with cold, and thoroughly
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>245 ext. near church</strong>: Reverend Dimmesdale, listening
to Mistress Hibbins tirade, turns upon her and silences her. Then he
starts forward to go to the aid of Hester.</p>
<p><strong>246 semi close-up hester and pearl</strong>: The child lies
there wet, shivering and frightened. Her mother wraps her in the shawl.
The child bursts into tears.</p>
<p><strong>247 semi long shot of market-place</strong>: The Puritans,
furious at this exhibition of wanton immodesty, revile Hester as she
hurries past them, carrying the child. They point their fingers, they
jeer at her. The minister hurries to her side. He holds up a hand in
protest. At this, all evidence of physical violence ceases; but their
scornful looks and pointing fingers make Hester aware that their hatred
of her is still alive in their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>248 close-up minister</strong>: His hand pressing his aching
heart–to think that <em>he</em> can go free, while Hester must
suffer!</p>
<p><strong>249 close-up hester and child</strong>: Hester, hurrying past
the camera on her way home, carrying the child in her arms.</p>
<p><strong>250 fade in int. minister’s study night</strong>: The
minister’s study is lit only by the glow of firelight. A strange, almost
disheveled figure is the minister as he kneels before the fire, his eyes
fastened on an iron poker which he lays on the coals until it is itself
a glowing coal. He reaches into the fire and, lifting it up by the cool
end, holds it before him, his lips fashioning a prayer. In his eyes is
the look of a fanatic. He tears off the front of his cassock and bares
his breast. As he brings the smoking brand close to his breast, we</p>
<p><strong>251 int. hester’s room close shot</strong>: Pearl is
dangerously ill with a fever. Hester watches anxiously, bending over the
bed, fixing her frightened eyes upon the child, who tosses about.
“Pearl!” she cries to the child, and waits with agonized suspense for a
response. Pearl is unconscious; now her little hands are growing cold.
Hester breathes upon them and chafes them to warm them. She is
frightened, bewildered–she does not know what to do. Suddenly, she
rises, calling out: “Giles!” as if her voice would carry to him.</p>
<p><strong>252 longer shot</strong>: She darts away from the bed as
though to go after Giles–then she darts back to Pearl, hating to leave
her; but finally, in desperation, she throws a shawl about herself and
runs from the room out into the night.</p>
<p><strong>253 ext. hester’s cottage</strong>: Hester exits from her
cottage and starts toward the village.</p>
<p><strong>254 int. meeting-house full shot</strong>: The building is
filled with the male colonists seated in the body of the house; the
dignitaries of the Government and Church are upon the platform. No women
are present.</p>
<p><strong>255 closer shot of platform</strong>: The Indians turn to
call from their midst a white man dressed in fantastic garb. This man is
Hester Prynne’s husband; he is old and slightly deformed, and
unnaturally bright eyes peer out from a sinister face. There is
something forbidding about him as he stands there explaining to the
Governor:</p>
<p><strong>256 close-up roger prynne</strong>: He is a mysterious,
menacing figure. He is addressing the Governor:</p>
<p><strong>257 semi long shot</strong>: The Governor is quite impressed
with this; his attitude toward Prynne is friendly and suggests that he
will come to his aid.</p>
<p><strong>258 ext. giles’ barber shop</strong>: A lantern over the door
shows this sign: HORACE GILES–BARBER AND SURGEON. Hester is pounding on
the door. Giles’ assistant opens the door. He tells her Giles isn’t
there and points over toward the meeting-house. Hester exits in the
direction of the meeting-house.</p>
<p><strong>259 ext. meeting-house</strong>: Hester comes outside of the
meeting-house, hesitates, and rushes up to the window.</p>
<p><strong>260 closer shot of window</strong>: Hester, peering in,
dramatically tense and eager. She searches until she finds–</p>
<p><strong>261 int. meeting-house close-up giles</strong>: Giles looking
in the opposite direction from Hester.</p>
<p><strong>262 int. meeting-house close-up at window</strong>: The face
of the frantic little mother is peering in at the window, trying to
attract the attention of Giles. Her white face is pressed against the
panes, her eyes, stark and staring, are trying to draw his attention.
She even beckons with her hand, thinking that perhaps the motion will
attract him. Finally she taps upon the window.</p>
<p><strong>263 int. meeting-house longer shot</strong>: The beadle,
hearing the tapping on the window, turns around and sees Hester. Furious
that she dare come there to pry into their affairs, he motions her away
and orders two very tall, gaunt Puritans to step in front of the window
to shield what goes on within from Hester’s eyes. Hester, forced to
leave, runs to the door.</p>
<p><strong>264 ext. meeting-house close shot at entrance</strong>:
Hester is tying to push her way through the crowd at the door, but the
two stern-looking Puritans refuse her admittance. No women are allowed
there in the first place, and how does <em>she</em> dare, she who wears
the badge of shame, to enter in search of Giles? Hester, pitting her
puny strength against theirs, tires to force her way in, but they force
her farther from the entrance. Then she frantically pleads with
them:</p>
<p><strong>265 ext. meeting-house at entrance longer shot</strong>:
Hester pushes her way through the crowd at the door, calling, “Giles!
Giles!” But the hand of one of the Puritans closes over her mouth.
Ducking under his arm, she evades him and pushes on past the tall
figures.</p>
<p><strong>266 int. meeting-house</strong>: Hester is a pathetic little
gray figure among the men who are like the tall trunks of dark
trees.</p>
<p><strong>267 semi close-up roger prynne, the beadle and the
governor</strong>: The Governor can be seen in the back, getting the
ledger. In the foreground Roger Prynne and the beadle. The face of the
stranger is drawn and dark. He turns toward the beadle, standing beside
him, and asks: “Who is that woman?”</p>
<p><strong>268 close-up prynne</strong>: He looks down at the ledger,
takes the quill, and starts to write:</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE-UP LEDGER:Prynne’s hand enters. He
writes ROGER–and starts to write PRYNNE, getting as far as the PR–when
the hand pauses and he writes over these two letters the word
CHILLINGWORTH.</p>
<p><strong>269 int. hester’s room semi close-up bed</strong>: Giles and
Hester are at the bedside of the child, who lies there rigid, in a
spasm–a spasm that has all the appearance of death. Giles bends over
her, examines her pulse and eyes, while Hester watches fearfully, not
daring to ask the verdict. Finally she gasps: “Canst thou do anything
for her?” and her voice raises to a wail.</p>
<p><strong>270 ext. meeting-house</strong>: In the lighted doorway the
beadle is pointing out the way to Hester’s house to her husband. His
sharp eyes shine under lowered brows, and there is an evil look in them
as he walks away.</p>
<p><strong>271 int. hester’s room</strong>: These moments of delay are
harrowing ones to Hester. She knows not which breath may be the last.
She feels that she can endure inaction no longer. She lifts the child,
heavy and stiff, in her arms and staggers with her to the center of the
room as if she were going to run to the church for fear that the
minister is not coming to her. Then, swaying under the weight of the
child, she knows it is madness, and carries the little one back to the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>272 ext. hester’s house</strong>: Prynne, walking toward the
door.</p>
<p><strong>273 int. hester’s house</strong>: Hester hears the sound of
footsteps upon the gravel. She is listening. Hope lights her face. It is
as though her heart had cried out, “He is come!” She rushes to the door
and swings it open.</p>
<p><strong>274 close-up doorway</strong>: Roger Prynne’s face leers at
Hester from the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>275 semi close-up roger and hester</strong>: Hester recoils
as though she had been struck. “Thou!” she cries, staring at him
transfixed.</p>
<p><strong>276 larger shot</strong>: Hester drops on her knees beside
the bed, her fear for the child surmounting every other emotion. For a
moment Prynne stands watching these two; and then without a word he
leans over and examines the child. Hester watches him fearfully. At last
he slips the knapsack off his back, opens it, and searches for a small
leather medicine case.</p>
<p><strong>227 semi close-up at bed</strong>: Prynne holds out the phial
to her, saying: “Woman, this child is yours–she is none of mine.
Administer this, therefore, with thine own hand.”</p>
<p><strong>278 semi close-up pearl and roger prynne</strong>: Prynne
listening to Pearl’s heart. Almost immediately Pearl begins to show
signs of relaxation–and signs of life returning.</p>
<p><strong>279 close-up hester</strong>: She is intently watching the
child and, as she signs of returning life, tears spring to her eyes, and
her lips are torn between a smile and a sob.</p>
<p><strong>280 semi close-up hester and roger</strong>: Hester looks up
at Prynne, who is studying the child. Her eyes are inquiring of him,
“She is better?” He tells her:</p>
<p><strong>281 close-up hester and prynne</strong>: Prynne, with
Hester’s wrist held in a firm grasp, draws her toward him. His fingers
press cruelly into her flesh. There pours from him a bitter, scathing
denunciation. “The name of the man!” he keeps repeating. “Confess!”</p>
<p><strong>282 ext. hester’s house at door</strong>: The minister is
dismissing Giles, for he would be alone with Hester and the child. So
weakened is he by the ordeal through which he has just passed that he is
almost on the verge of a collapse.</p>
<p><strong>283 int. hester’s house</strong>: Roger Prynne releases
Hester from his firm, cruel grasp. There is an expression of fiendish
cunning in his face as he turns and kneels down beside the child with
his back to the door. Hester hurries forward, inwardly praying that she
can stop the minister. But she is too late. As Prynne drops down beside
the bed, the door flings open and the minister comes in. He does not see
Prynne as he staggers toward Hester, crying out:</p>
<p><strong>284 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: Hester’s first
thought is for the protection of the man she loves, but she seems
paralyzed with horror as she draws out of his arms and looks toward
Prynne.</p>
<p><strong>285 close-up prynne</strong>: Prynne is smiling that
diabolical smile which is filled with a threat and a promise of revenge.
He slowly rises, his eyes fixed upon Hester and the minister.</p>
<p><strong>286 longer shot</strong>: The minister is shocked to discover
a stranger in the room. As Prynne rises and makes one step toward the
minister, Hester’s one thought is that he will do no bodily harm to the
man that she loves. She springs toward the minister protectingly; but
Roger Prynne’s revenge is more subtle. He smiles; there is a suggestion
of a bow in his gesture as he faces them. Indicating Hester, he
says:</p>
<p><strong>287 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: So much has
the minister endured of physical and mental suffering that he has now
reached the peak of despair. Hester still stands before him in that
protecting attitude, her eyes fixed upon Prynne, as if she were
hypnotized by him. She waits for the sentence that he will pronounce
upon them, as if waiting for her doom.</p>
<p><strong>288 semi long shot of room</strong>: Prynne moves slowly,
with deliberate, measured footsteps. He gets his knapsack and puts it
over his shoulder. He walks over to the bed and picks up his hat. He
acts as if he were alone in the room, that these two terrified people
whose destiny he has in his hands are not there, staring at him
transfixed. When he reaches the door, he pauses. His hand is already on
the knob before he looks back at them.</p>
<p><strong>289 close-up prynne</strong>: Prynne’s face is snake-like.
His little eyes are still fixed upon them. He smiles again that twisted,
terrible smile, and he speaks quietly with sinister emphasis:</p>
<p><strong>290 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: They are
almost spell-bound at what Prynne is saying to them.</p>
<p><strong>291 close-up prynne at the door</strong>: He opens the door
as if he were going out; then he looks back again and speaks:</p>
<p><strong>292 longer shot of the room</strong>: Slowly, Prynne walks
out, closing the door after him. Hester clings to the minister.</p>
<p><strong>293 fade in int. tavern long shot daylight</strong>: The
captain from the Spanish ship and several of his crew are seated at one
of the tables. They are colorful, interesting pirates. The captain is a
jolly cavalier, rotund and friendly. At the other tables are somber,
sanctimonious Puritans eating with great solemnity. Hester and Pearl
enter. The child, bashful, clings to her mother’s skirts. Hester goes
over to the innkeeper to ask him which of the men there is the captain
of the Spanish boat. The innkeeper, surprised at Hester’s request, goes
to the captain, asking him if he would speak with Hester. The old
pirate, delighted to speak to any pretty girl, rises and goes over to
her.</p>
<p><strong>294 semi close-up hester and the captain</strong>: The
captain bows before Hester with quite a show of gallantry. When Hester
talks to him, she keeps her hand over the scarlet letter on he breast.
She is asking him eagerly:</p>
<p><strong>295 fade in ext. woods near bridge over stream</strong>:
Hester is waiting anxiously near the old trysting-place. Pearl can be
seen in the background playing at the edge of the brook. Hester’s eyes
fairly glow with happiness when she sees the minister coming toward her.
He walks with an effort. Death is already knocking at his door. His face
seems drawn and white. His eyes are deep-shadowed and have in them that
far-away look of one whose vision is fast dimming.</p>
<p><strong>296 close-up hester and the minister</strong>: Hester tells
him breathlessly her plans–that she has seen the captain of the boat,
that he must leave, fly from the threatened revenge of Roger Prynne.
Earnestly, she is trying to persuade him.</p>
<p><strong>297 close-up hester</strong>: Hester is watching him
intensely. Her eyes are deep with love. She whispers with scaring
happiness–her heart already relieved of much of its pain:</p>
<p><strong>298 close-up dimmesdale</strong>: Dimmesdale hears her words
and looks at her as their meaning begins to dawn on him. His eyes widen
with wonder and longing. Then slowly does he catch the infection of her
courage; he begins to yield to her persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>299 semi close-up hester and dimmesdale</strong>: She draws
closer to him–her hands find his. Her face is glowing now with the
happiness that had been lost through the long years of suffering. She
cries out to him:</p>
<p><strong>300 close-up hester</strong>: The wind is blowing Hester’s
hair–her eyes are lighted with the divine light of happiness. Then
slowly there comes over her face a strange expression which is
unexplained for a few moments. She is staring down at the child. What is
that the child is holding in her hand? Memories of the past come
flooding back, terrifying her. Will she never be allowed to forget the
past? Two little hands reach up into the scene and pin the scarlet
letter on Hester’s breast. Then the hands withdraw, and slowly Hester’s
hands rise and start binding her hair.</p>
<p><strong>301 fade in ext. mistress hibbins’ house</strong>: Mistress
Hibbins is sitting by the window. She has been sewing on a dress but she
has fallen asleep against the high back of the chair, her sewing falling
to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>302 longer shot of house to include window</strong>: Giles
creeping out from behind a bush. He has been waiting for Mistress
Hibbins to fall asleep. He peers around–no one is watching. Then he
steals into her house.</p>
<p><strong>303 int. mistress hibbins’ house</strong>: Mistress Hibbins’
hat and shawl rest on a chair nearby. Giles picks up the dress,
stealthily, lest the old gossip should awaken and see him. Then he
tiptoes out to the fireplace, gets the broom, and, returning, slips the
head of the broom through the dress, stuffs the shawl into the dress,
and jams the hat on the head of the broom, hiding the twigs. And in but
a few minutes Master Giles has rigged up an effigy of Mistress
Hibbins!</p>
<p><strong>304 street shooting from giles’ position</strong>: The
Governor and the beadle walking down the street very pompously,
discussing weighty affairs of state. They have almost reached the
window.</p>
<p><strong>305 semi close-up giles</strong>: Giles, hiding himself
behind the wall at the side of the window– the effigy hiding the
sleeping Mistress Hibbins. Giles addresses the effigy:</p>
<p><strong>306 ext. mistress hibbins’ house</strong>: The Governor and
the beadle stop short as they hear these words. The Governor looks
toward the window. He sets his jaw; his eyes flash as he sees:</p>
<p><strong>307 ext. window</strong>: Mistress Hibbins is nodding.</p>
<p><strong>308 int. mistress hibbins’ living room</strong>: Giles,
peeking around the edge of the window to see how the Governor is taking
it, continues: “Fie, for shame, Mistress Hibbins!”–and then he bends
over close to the bonnet as if he were listening with his hand to his
ear:</p>
<p><strong>309 semi close-up beadle and the governor</strong>: The
Governor’s brows are drawn into a hard line. He and the beadle exchange
glances which bode ill for Mistress Hibbins. They are just starting on
when the Governor says threateningly:</p>
<p><strong>310 int. hibbins’ house</strong>: Giles grins from ear to
ear! He blows a kiss to the sleeping Hibbins. “At last!” he whispers,
“At last!”</p>
<p><strong>311 int. reverend dimmesdale’s study</strong>: In his study
Reverend Dimmesdale is gathering his few things together–his favorite
books. He is almost feverish in his haste, working as though he would
keep from thinking.</p>
<p><strong>312 int. hester’s home</strong>: Hester is on the floor,
kneeling before the little trunk. There is a pile of clothes–hers and
Pearl’s–near the trunk, and she packs and unpacks the things, so
bewildered by her happiness that she does not know what she is doing.
Pearl is trying to help. She carries her funny-looking doll to her
mother to be carefully packed away with the other things. Hester spins
around in sheer happiness as she dreams that on the morrow the three of
them will have escaped, and all pain and unhappiness will be
forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>312 fade in ext. market-place</strong>: The street is agog
with activity. An air of festivity prevails. As the people pass to and
fro, drums beating, the band strikes up and some of the Puritanical
solemnity seems lost.</p>
<p><strong>314 semi long shot of the ducking pond</strong>: Giles is
about to duck Mistress Hibbins. The crowd is waiting in breathless
expectancy.</p>
<p><strong>315 ext. market-place</strong>: The Election Day procession
is coming down the street–the people in the foreground eager to see.</p>
<p><strong>316 semi close-up market-place</strong>: Hester is standing
there, watching the parade. She is as eager and as excited as a
child–even more so than Pearl who clutches at her mother’s hand, rising
on tiptoe when the soldiers go past. The people have moved away from
Hester, so that she always stands alone.</p>
<p><strong>317 flash of the procession going toward the church</strong>:
Much pomp. The band is followed by the soldiers in glittering armor with
weapons flashing in the sunlight. Men from off the Spanish ship.
Puritans in their holiday garb. The minister walks beside the
Governor.</p>
<p><strong>318 semi close-up hester and group</strong>: Hester is no
longer able to control her eager excitement. In a few moments the
minister will pass by and their eyes will meet. There will be a salute
between them–a flash of recognition. In a few hours they will be away!
She doesn’t notice that Roger Prynne is walking up to her, standing in
back of her.</p>
<p><strong>319 close-up prynne and hester</strong>: Hester, conscious
that someone is near her, turns slowly and looks into the eye of Prynne.
Prynne smiles and bows, then quietly moves away. Hester’s eyes follow
him. The light of her happiness dies out, and then slowly comes back to
her as she dismisses this fear. It is only a transient one. A few hours
longer!</p>
<p><strong>320 medium long shot</strong>: In this shot we see the
procession passing by Hester. The minister walks beside the Governor–the
beadle in back of them. They march close to Hester.</p>
<p><strong>321 close-up minister–camera on moving platform</strong>: The
minister, walking along, looks over at Hester. His eyes signal to hers.
There is in them a sudden sparkle. He, too, knows a divine
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>322 close-up hester</strong>: At the sight of the minister
she has forgotten Prynne. There is an air of suppressed excitement about
her. Her eyes answer the signal shot from the minister’s eyes. Their
glances say very plainly, “In a few hours, my loved one.”</p>
<p><strong>323 ext. church</strong>: The minister and the Governor and
the beadle enter the church. Then all the people pour into the church,
for the minister is to preach the election sermon.</p>
<p><strong>324 int. church</strong>: For the cutting, it might be well
to have a semi close-up of Prynne. His face is gloomy and foreboding in
spite of his smile. He slinks into one of the pews and sits down,
waiting for his evil moment of triumph.</p>
<p><strong>325 ext. church</strong>: The Puritans have poured into the
church. Hester sees that the church is filled. She would go in, but the
beadle motions her away. She and Pearl go over to the foot of the
scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>326 int. church</strong>: The church is now filled. The
minister is stepping up into the pulpit.</p>
<p><strong>327 close-up pulpit</strong>: Dimmesdale is standing ready to
begin his sermon. There is something akin to ecstasy in his expression.
This is to be his last sermon, preached with an exaltation of spirit as
if his troubled heart had found repose at last.</p>
<p><strong>328 ext. pillory</strong>: Hester stands there alone with
Pearl. The Indians, passing by, stop and stare at her curiously. The
child is frightened and hides behind her mother’s skirts. When one of
the Indians points to the letter on Hester’s breast, her hands fly to
hide it. She looks at them, hurt and frightened. Two Indians pass by
close to the camera, one saying to the other:</p>
<p><strong>329 int. church long shot</strong>: Minister preaching. He is
looking from his pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits have
yielded to his control. They gaze upon him as though he held them
spellbound.</p>
<p><strong>330 close-up minister</strong>: As he preaches his face is
glowing with light. He seems scarcely aware of the people in the church.
His hands are uplifted, as if in supplication.</p>
<p><strong>331 ext. church at pillory</strong>: Hester stands there
alone, waiting for the minister. She seems lost in a reverie of dreams.
The sunlight is falling upon her face which reflects her inner
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>332 fade in int. church long shot</strong>: The eyes of the
congregation are upon their minister. As he stands in his pulpit he
seems almost transfigured, so far has the exaltation of prayer carried
him. Then suddenly we see him stop short; his hands fall to his sides.
His eyes are focused on someone in the church! What are his tragic eyes
looking at as they strain in their sockets?</p>
<p><strong>333 close-up roger prynne in the congregation</strong>: Roger
Prynne is sitting there, his eyes focused upon the minister. In them is
a look–terrible, meaningful, triumphant.</p>
<p><strong>334 close-up minister</strong>: The minister makes an effort
to go on, but all strength seems to have ebbed from him, all inspiration
is gone. He cannot move; he cannot speak. His hand goes to his heart. He
makes a gesture of dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>335 long shot</strong>: The minister steps from the pulpit
and we see quite a movement among the people in the church. Why had that
flow of eloquence stopped so suddenly? When they see the minister with
his hand upon his heart, they know. He has overtaxed himself; he had
summoned too much strength to try to give them a great sermon and had
over-reached himself.</p>
<p><strong>336 ext. church</strong>: Hester Prynne in the foreground
with Pearl, waiting. She moves forward eagerly when she sees that the
people are beginning to pour out of the church. The captain of the
Spanish boat passes close to her. She hurries over to him with light
happy steps.</p>
<p><strong>337 close-up hester and the captain</strong>: She beckons for
him to bend his shaggy head close to hers. She whispers in his ear:
“Thou hast the cabins all ready?”</p>
<p><strong>338 ext. market-place</strong>: The crowd has gathered
outside of the church, waiting for their minister. They prepare for the
continuation of the procession. It has reached some size. Again there is
evidence of pomp and formality. Soldiers are lining up, forming a
pathway which leads to the church. They keep the crowd back, though the
latter presses forward ready to cry out a welcome to its minister when
he shall cross the threshold of the church.</p>
<p><strong>339 closer shot</strong>: The trumpeters pass by Hester and
Pearl. They are followed by men blowing fifes and beating drums. Hester,
reaching the very height of her happiness, stands there watching
them.</p>
<p><strong>340 int. church</strong>: The church is fast emptying; only a
few are left. The Governor and the minister are walking toward the door
when Roger Prynne steps up to the minister. The minister can hardly
retain his self-possession at the sight of Prynne. The Governor, seeing
that Prynne wishes a few words alone with the minister, passes on. The
minister is ashen-white; his hand goes to his heart.</p>
<p><strong>341 close-up minister and prynne</strong>: The two talk low,
tensely. “Thou art planning to escape,” warns Prynne. “Thou hast dreamed
that freedom would come to thee– freedom!” and he laughs scornfully.</p>
<p><strong>342 ext. church</strong>: The crowd is eagerly waiting for
their minister and in the foreground is Hester.</p>
<p><strong>343 close-up hester and the child</strong>: Hester can no
longer hide her joy. The child, laughing, clutches at her mother’s hand
and looks up into that flushed, excited face.</p>
<p><strong>344 ext. church long shot</strong>: A cry goes up from the
crowd–a cheer at the sight of their minister.</p>
<p><strong>345 close-up hester</strong>: Her heart quickens; she will
behold him in this hour of triumph.</p>
<p><strong>346 shot of crowd</strong>: Another cry goes up–then startled
silence.</p>
<p><strong>347 ext. at entrance of church</strong>: The minister is
staggering forward. He seizes hold of the portals of the door to keep
from falling. There is drama in his very weakness.</p>
<p><strong>348 shot of crowd</strong>: Hester is in the foreground. A
silence like a pall has fallen upon the crowd. Hester is straining
forward, her agonized eyes upon the minister.</p>
<p><strong>349 semi close-up at door of church</strong>: Dimmesdale
struggles against his growing weakness. He looks over the crowd with
fast-dimming eyes and then he sees–</p>
<p><strong>351 medium shot including the minister and hester</strong>:
Hester watches as a radiantly happy smile illuminates the minister’s
face and, gathering new strength, he starts down the steps. Hester
stands directly in his path, and it would seem that his happy smile is
for her. She draws back, fearful that any contact with her will cast its
reflection upon him. And then, when he sways unsteadily, she starts
forward as though to help him. But when he comes close to her, she sees
that his radiant eyes are fastened upon something beyond, and he passes
by without even seeing her.</p>
<p><strong>352 long shot</strong>: The Puritans make way for the
minister in hushed silence, watching. He goes toward the scaffold and
starts up the steps.</p>
<p><strong>353 close-up hester</strong>: It is suddenly revealed to
Hester what the minister intends to do. A scream almost tears out of
her. Then she stifles it and stands there, not knowing what to do. She
starts forward as though she would stop him–then hesitates. Anything she
does will damn him in the eyes of the people.</p>
<p><strong>354 long shot</strong>: The minister has reached the platform
of the pillory and is standing there, swaying unsteadily as he motions
for the people to listen to what he has to say.</p>
<p><strong>355 close shot of prynne</strong>: Prynne, standing near the
church, is malevolently watching Dimmesdale.</p>
<p><strong>356 semi close-up the minister</strong>: The minister
straightens and lifts his head as though throwing a burden off his
shoulders. There is something strangely triumphant in his voice as he
cries aloud to the crowd:</p>
<p><strong>357 semi long shot</strong>: For a second the hushed silence
of the crowd is unbroken–and then the figure of Hester flies through the
stunned crowd and up the steps of the scaffold to the side of the man
she loves.</p>
<p><strong>358 semi close-up pillory</strong>: The minister falls on his
knees beside Hester, crying out, “Hester Prynne!” with piercing
sweetness.</p>
<p><strong>359 close shot of crowd</strong>: It would seem that she has
convinced them. So eager are they to believe their minister innocent
that they echo her own words: “He is mad! The poor man, his illness hath
made him lose his mind.” And they nod to each other, trying to convince
themselves that their saint is still a saint.</p>
<p><strong>360 ext. pillory semi long shot</strong>: The Governor now
walks to the foot of the scaffold. There is movement among the waiting
crowds.</p>
<p><strong>361 close-up minister</strong>: He is crying out, “I bid thee
look again as I, in my death hour, stand before thee. I bid thee look
again at Hester’s scarlet letter!” With a convulsive motion, he tears
away the ministerial band before his breast, and there is revealed the
letter “A”–the badge of shame which he had burned upon his breast with
the fiery cross.</p>
<p><strong>362 semi long shot</strong>: For an instant the
horror-stricken gaze of the crowd is concentrated upon the ghastly
miracle. The minister stands with a flush of triumph in his face as one
who, in the crisis of acutest pain, has won a victory. Then he sinks
down upon the scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>363 close-up prynne</strong>: Roger Prynne cries out:</p>
<p><strong>364 semi close-up hester, the minister and pearl</strong>:
The dying man’s eyes are fixed upon the child. “My little Pearl,” he
says feebly. There is a sweet and gentle smile over his face as of a
spirit sinking in deep repose. ““Wilt thou kiss me?”</p>
<p><strong>365 close-up hester and minister</strong>: Hester holds him
in her arms with his head resting against her breast. “Hester,” breathes
the clergyman, “It is farewell.”</p>
<p><strong>366 close-up governor</strong>: The old man bows his head.
The last dying wish of the minister shall be fulfilled; Hester Prynne
shall never again wear the badge of shame.</p>
<p><strong>367 semi close-up the minister and hester</strong>: His last
words to her are:</p>
<p><strong>368 longer shot</strong>: The Puritans stand awed into
silence at the scene before them.</p>
<p><strong>369 semi close-up hester and the minister</strong>: Hester is
enveloped in a great calmness now that she knows he is at rest, and she
says very simply:</p>
<p><strong>370 long shot</strong>: The people scarcely move; as if they
couldn’t quite believe that the minister was dead, that the voice of
Hester was falling upon their ears, asking that they should pray. She
has risen now and stands before the cross.</p>
<p><strong>371 semi close-up the governor</strong>: The Governor reveals
his hat and stands on the stairs of the scaffold in prayer.</p>
