<p><strong>“highlander iv</strong>: WORLD WITHOUT END” – Draft
9/1/99</p>
<p><strong>sweep low</strong>: through CLINGING HIGHLAND MISTS that
shroud a land still in its infancy. Cathedral spires of granite. Cradled
lakes. A solitary vastness. VOICE</p>
<p><strong>we have been worshipped as gods mistaken for demons and
reviled’as witches. we are the seeds of a million legends but our true
origins are unknown. we simply are.</strong>: ANCIENT CASTLES dot the
landscape, whisper of battles long forgotton. VOICE</p>
<p><strong>we are driven by the ceaseless fight to endure. no limit, it
is a battle that knows no boundry of time or place.</strong>: TWO
FIGURES clash with broadswords atop the tallest promontory. VOICE</p>
<p><strong>to the winner comes an unknowable prize. yet an immortal can
find no comfort in victory.</strong>: MATCH MOVE to the top of an
ULTRA-MODERN SKYSCRAPER. Swordsmen continue to battle. VOICE</p>
<p><strong>because in the end, there can be only one.</strong>: Loser
falls to the other’s sword as the HEAVENS CLEAVE in a TITANIC RUPTURE OF
SIGHT AND SOUND. Like the birth of a brand new universe.</p>
<p><strong>ext - manhattan, present-day establishing - dawn</strong>:
Teeming millions. Yawning concrete spires. Blare of traffic.</p>
<p><strong>ext - antique store - dawn</strong>: Engraved into a brass
plaque:</p>
<p><strong>macleod &amp; ellenstein antiques</strong>: A FACE reflects
in the window glass. It’s RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60’s now, a graying,
maternal beauty. She moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t.
It falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still
flipped to “WE�RE CLOSED” Rachel hesitates. Draws a shallow breath and
steps inside.</p>
<p><strong>int - antique store</strong>: All those sublime European
antiquities now drip with menace. Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding
statuary. She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp.
Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things.
An open wooden case, empty. Just the felt impression of a missing
broadsword.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Connor…? She crosses to the foot of the
staircase. Listens.</p>
<p><strong>a music box</strong>: spools a faint, tinny madrigal. She
climbs the stairs, padding softly upward. The music grinds EVER LOUDER
in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it’s punctuated by a
CHILD’S GIGGLE.</p>
<p><strong>at the second floor landing</strong>: Rachel edges around the
corner. Her breath catches in her throat. BEFORE HER stands a locked
wooden cabinet. It’s been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that
still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel. PHOTO
ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across
the floor– –except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the
sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe.
Like she’s taken that sword in her own gut. INSIDE THE CABINET A
TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES. A LITTLE GIRL
is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR
MACLEOD.</p>
<p><strong>young rachel</strong>: Let me see, Connor! Let me see! Rachel
stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in RAGGED FILM
CLIPS. CONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse. CONNOR with RACHEL
outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college
graduation. CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at
something deeper. In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has
not. Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip
and jerks it clean of the cabinet. THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
<p><strong>the videotape ends, clicks off…</strong>: and a NEW IMAGE
burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring
back at herself, terror-stricken. She hadn’t even noticed it before now.
The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light.
MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV
until the PIXELS SWIM… THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old
rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It’s not just beckoning her.
It’s taunting her. Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her
breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone. Any second now, you’d expect
it to stop ringing, nobody home. But whoever’s on the other end knows
better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant. Trembling fingers reach
out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>extreme close on phone:</strong>: A TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is
the last thing Rachel hears before–</p>
<p><strong>ext - antique store - wide</strong>: –a BLISTERING EXPLOSION
blows out the entire second floor. Rachel Ellenstein is obliterated
right along with her own treasured history. Linger on the FLAMES as
we</p>
<p><strong>a mound of burning corpses</strong>: They crackle and twist
in the fire that feeds off them. It takes a moment to realize they’re
LIVESTOCK– oxen, pigs, goats, sheep– piled like burning refuse. A CRUDE,
WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame.
BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from
the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion.
Heather looks on in horror.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: My God, what are they?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Farm animals. Dead of the plague.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Why do they torment us with their dead
cattle? Connor…?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: They think I’ve brought this upon them. It’s
a warning. A deeper fear now grips Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: A warning?! They drove you from your home!
They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?!
Connor turns away from the flaming heap.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Someone to blame.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: CONNOR swinging astride his horse.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Don’t go back there. THUNDER RUMBLES in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Please–</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: They can’t hurt me. And they know it. But
they can still hurt the ones I care about. Heather looks off.
Shivers.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m afraid. Connor leans forward, takes her
face in his hands.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I love you, Heather. More than anything in
this world. She grips his hands. Desperately. CONNOR Do you believe
me?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Then you needn’t be afraid. Nothing can ever
keep us apart.</p>
<p><strong>ext - scottish highlands, various - dawn</strong>: Connor
travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog-shrouded
valleys.</p>
<p><strong>connor’s voice</strong>: Nothing…</p>
<p><strong>ext - ridge above glenfinnan - twilight</strong>: He gazes
down at the tiny hamlet of Glenfinnan, nestled between castle and
shimmering loch. Breathes deep the forgotten smell of home.</p>
<p><strong>int - hut - evening</strong>: CAIOLIN MACLEOD, ravaged by
neglect and despair, strokes her son’s face as if confirming his
reality.</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: I thought you might be the water horse come
to take me on his back and drown me in the loch.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Maybe I am, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: Then come, let me grab hold of your golden
mane and off we go. Connor lifts her from the tattered bed, spins her
around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Not before we put some meat on those bones.
He rummages through her shelves looking for food. Finds painfully
little. CONNOR No one comes to look after you?</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: They’re all afraid of me. They think I
bedevil their children because I’ve lost my own.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: Tiny minds and sour dispositions. I don’t
need them, Connor. Any of them. Connor crouches at her feet.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Then it’s settled. You’re coming with me.
There’s somebody I want you to meet. She’s nearly as beautiful as you.
Caiolin blinks back her disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: You’re sure? CONNOR We leave tonight. Let’s
start packing.</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: I’m already packed.</p>
<p><strong>the slatted wooden door</strong>: swings OPEN. A YOUNG MAN
stands in the doorway. He’s strong and severe, dressed in clergyman’s
black. But that’s not what draws the eye. Even though it’s cold enough
to fog his breath– he’s sweatinq. Connor looks up, guarded.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Jacob–</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: You shouldna come back, Connor. Connor feels
the tension in Kase’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Surely as a friend you can look the other
way just this once… For old times’ sake…</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: You knew. You knew what would happen if you
came back. I am not to blame for this.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What? What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: God help you. FATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY, the
local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane. He’s
gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL
figures prominently in his overall appearance. VILLAGERS of varying
stripe crowd nervously behind them.</p>
<p><strong>father rainey</strong>: In the name of the Holy See and the
rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the
practice of black magic. Take him. The townsmen jostle in place, each
trying to squeeze backward behind the other. FATHER RAINEY Heresy is not
contagious. Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the
elbows. Once its clear they haven’t sucked up any demons, the others
SWARM HIM.</p>
<p><strong>ext - stone hut - night</strong>: Caiolin SCREAMS as Connor’s
dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of
sticks and clubs.</p>
<p><strong>int - stone cell - night</strong>: Connor stirs awake in a
centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp. VOICES seem to
drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant. He
crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level
view of THE TOWN COMMONS where a well-attended EXECUTION is now
underway. Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the
condemned. TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his
line-of-sight. Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding
chatter.</p>
<p><strong>jacob kase’s voice</strong>: The curse that afflicts one
generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of
blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that
of your son. Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal: CONNOR’S MOTHER
bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes
with the impossible horror of recognition.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No.. . NO! ! JACOB KASE Makes the sign of
the cross as he reads from a writ of execution. He stands atop a
primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father
Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic
angina.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Through the infinite compassion of our Lord
God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is
unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end
to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin
MacLeod? Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific.</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: If your god should persecute me into the
next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another. Shocked
murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd. Kase steps up and RIPS
AWAY Caiolin’s cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden
Christ figure.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: You won’t need this where you’re going. CONNOR
grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from
their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin.
Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and
drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her
coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest.</p>
<p><strong>executioner</strong>: Black powder. It will make short work
of your suffering. Caiolin nods. He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for
a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar
continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY. THE
EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS. CONNOR tries to
squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the
iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone,
SPARKING and CHIPPING… THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat
ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker,
louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains
spitefully intact. Still, it’s enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to
intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor
with swords and axes. &gt;Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace,
Connor splits the first guard’s head, catches his sword mid-air and
slices into the next. Third guard’s axe catches on a ceiling beam.
Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack. The fourth guard
drops his sword and BOLTS. THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks
out through the rippling wall of flame… . . . and smiles weakly.</p>
<p><strong>caiolin</strong>: My water horse… AS CONNOR splits the crowd
like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside
with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back,
watching Connor desperately scatter the fire. Caiolin buries her face in
her shoulder, biting back the agony as… Sword in hand, Connor stretches
upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now
crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs. Freed of the
ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward. Connor grabs for her arm as THE
BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further
hope of rescue futile. Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked
tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings. He
throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens. Fire dances across
Connor’s skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down
into the crowd. PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn’t just a common witch.
This is one of Hell’s very own. Those few foolish enough to attack are
cut down where they stand. The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father
Rainey blocks Connor’s path. Lifts his cross… . . . as he’s CUT DOWN by
the blind SLASH of Connor’s sword. Connor steps over Rainey’s body and
keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings. Kase
crouches blustering over Rainey.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Father… Father, please– Father–! Rainey’s eyes
open slightly.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Who are you…?</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Your son. It’s your son– Jacob. Rainey stares
back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees
terrifies him to death.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Who are YOU?</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: I’m your– He stops. Rainey’s eyes are frozen.
Dead. CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the
sight of his mother’s blackened corpse. &gt;KASE scoops up a discarded
sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman.
&gt;Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on
the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor’s smoldering
visage– the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It’s the
last thing Jacob Kase will ever see. Connor opens his fingers and lets
him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase’s chest. Gathering up
several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the
straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE. In short order,
the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO. Silhouetted
against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin’s body and turns his back
on Glenfinnan for the last time.</p>
<p><strong>ext - ancient stone monastery - night</strong>: Standing
outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb.
Nothing in the panorama would suggest we’ve just jumped four centuries
into an uncertain future… Until– A PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS chew their way
up the rubbled slope. Fishtail to a stop. THE LEADER, a tall
eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded
monk.</p>
<p><strong>jamaican</strong>: You people are extremely hard to find.
Monk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN.</p>
<p><strong>hooded monk</strong>: We like it that way. Now go. The other
six INTRUDERS surround the monk. His eyes flick from one to the next– a
buffet of different nationalities, all big.</p>
<p><strong>jamaican</strong>: Take your pick. Before you squeeze the
trigger a second time, you’ll be dead. Easy choice. Monk levels his gun
and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet. And sure enough, he GAGS
before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into
a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN,
turns for the door, joined by the others. IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the
heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE–
The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS
appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>monk #1</strong>: Take the heads. Just in case. Saws and
cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun
trained on the corpses.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t bother. Really. A FIGURE stands in
shadow, his face UNSEEN. We catch only a brief glimpse of a PRIEST�S
COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts
it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the
guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall. Stranger kicks
the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Don�t be long.</p>
<p><strong>int - monastery - night</strong>: FOLLOW THE STRANGER through
a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs. He KICKS THROUGH
a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air
seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to
complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been
immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From
the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled
fingernails, it’s a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in
years. Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling
silently. Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by
flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: So it’s true. He moves slowly among them.
STRANGER What sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting
pieces of meat. He pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the
shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted iron, the face
by tangled beard. STRANGER Tell me– is this the better way? I’m sure
you’ve had some time to reflect on it. One by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD
INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples
their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense,
fully-restored. Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified
Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Which one is Connor MacLeod?</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: I– I don’t know… They never told me
names…</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Don’t. Lie. To. Me.</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: I swear. I don’t know… Stranger grabs him
under the chin, lifts him to his toes.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: You need to understand one thing, my gimpy
friend. I don’t care about the Game. I don’t care about the rules. I
don’t even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a
barrier to the Prize. The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending.
STRANGER I want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I’ll leave. And you
can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters. The
custodian lifts a shaking finger. RACK FOCUS TO: THE PRISONER IN THE
LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably
Connor MacLeod. Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns…</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Long time. Connor strains to lift his
head. His voice comes weak and drug-heavy.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Who are you…?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: You’ll know soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>ext - monastery - night</strong>: An unearthly LIGHT pulses
through slitted windows and cracked mortar. TENDRILS of RAW ENERGY vein
the ancient building, growing BRIGHTER until– THE WINDOWS EXPLODE
OUTWARD with a keening, animal-like HOWL. ABOVE the sky responds with
SCREAMING WIND and TORRENTS of RAIN.</p>
<p><strong>ext - paris - night</strong>: WIND HOWLS over the City of
Lights, slicing up the Seine to. . .</p>
<p><strong>duncan macleod’s barge</strong>: docked at the quay.</p>
<p><strong>ext - barge - night</strong>: PUSH IN on DUNCAN MACLEOD,
cross-legged in meditation atop the deck. He JOLTS from a series of
SUDDEN VIOLENT IMAGES. A FACE, bolted immobile, wrenched in agony. A
SWORDBLADE slashing into flesh. FINGERNAILS clawing wood. BLOOD flecking
tile. ESSENCE. PHONE. Ringing. Duncan snaps up the receiver, sweat
drenched.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Yeah? Tiny electric CLICK… . . . then the
HISS of an overseas line.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>a payphone, somewhere in lower manhattan</strong>: In a
driving RAIN. A woman’s hand holds the receiver to her face, obscuring
her features.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Connor MacLeod. He was killed last night.</p>
<p><strong>int - duncan’s barge</strong>: Duncan reels with a sudden
flood of emotions.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Who is this?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: A friend.</p>
<p><strong>ext - payphone</strong>: The unidentified woman slowly lowers
the receiver and sets it back in the cradle.</p>
<p><strong>ext - paris, establishing, sunrise</strong>: Shadows crawl
across the Parisian skyline as an ENGINE REVS TO 8000 RPM.</p>
<p><strong>street level pov:</strong>: We PUNCH through the ARC DE
TRIOMPHE and up the CHAMPS ELYSEE with a throaty FERARRI HOWL. On a
WICKED DOWNSHIFT, we SQUEAL HARD RIGHT onto the PONT NEUF, stopping on a
franc at</p>
<p><strong>ext - notre dame cathedral - day</strong>: Duncan hops out of
his Ferrari 355 Spyder, pauses before the massive Gothic edifice, then
disappears inside.</p>
<p><strong>close on a crouching stone gargoyle</strong>: perched atop
the highest balustrade. MOVE SIDEWAYS TO REVEAL A SECOND CROUCHING
FIGURE, this one human. To many he’ll be instantly familiar. He�s
METHOS, oldest of all Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation.
Methos keeps staring at the ground below, sipping bordeaux from a paper
cup, even as Duncan joins him at the edge.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Methos.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: so– What brings you up here to the aerie of
the lesser gods?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: I’m out of the help business. No future in
it.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I was told Connor MacLeod was killed last
night. Methos’ darkens. Another one lost. DUNCAN I just want to know who
did it.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: In our world, does it really matter?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It does to me. Methos looks down at the
clotted life below.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: Did I ever tell you I once kept a vineyard
on the very spot where they built this monstrosity? Glorious, the wine.
When did you see him last?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Almost ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: What did you talk about?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Nothing much.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: Think back.</p>
<p><strong>int - pub - day</strong>: Connor and Duncan hunch over the
bar, pounding scotch.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: We mostly just sat around, downing shots,
staring at the beer lights above the bar. When he finally got up to go,
he looked at me like it was the last time I’d ever see him again. No
goodbye. No handshake. Just got up and left.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: Duncan blinks back the memory.
DUNCAN Nobody’s seen him since.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: Describe the look.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: Describe it.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It was like…</p>
<p><strong>flash: connor’s face</strong>: DUNCAN . . . Like every death
he’d ever caused had come back to haunt him.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: Methos takes a thoughtful sip from
his wine.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: For an Immortal who comes to abhor
bloodshed, there’s a solution– a way to be removed from the Game
forever. The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical
purposes, protected from the violence within yourself. It’s called The
Sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: Think of those Buddhist monks who came to
cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of
grass was a violation of their creed. They placed themselves into an
extreme form of protective custody. A sanctuary of sorts. What I’m
talking about is something similar. But one that doesn’t allow for a
change of heart. He opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the
plaza below. Wine SPLATTERS like blood on white marble. METHOS
Apparently it was wiped out last night.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: By who?</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ext - above the atlantic - day</strong>: A 747 cruises at
40,000 feet.</p>
<p><strong>methos</strong>: He left no witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>int - 747 - day</strong>: Duncan stares out the passenger
window as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT sets a DRINK down. He lifts the little
plastic COCKTAIL SWORD from the glass. Yanks it out of the olive…</p>
<p><strong>transition to:</strong>: A BROADSWORD being jerked from a
fallen warrior.</p>
<p><strong>ext - 17th century battlefield - dawn</strong>: FOLLOW THE
SWORD swinging above a PAIR OF HIDE-BOOTED FEET that tramp across uneven
ground littered with CORPSES. FEET STOP at a BLOOD-CAKED BODY, swathed
in the shredded colors of a defeated army. On a SWIFT KICK TO THE
RIBCAGE– DUNCAN MACLEOD JERKS UPRIGHT, flailing in spastic fits.</p>
<p><strong>gahhhhhhh! !</strong>: He blinks thickly, as if routed from a
deep, disorienting slumber. Gapes up at–</p>
<p><strong>a silhouette</strong>: that ECLIPSES the rising sun.</p>
<p><strong>silhouette</strong>: You’ve better things to do than lie
there collecting flies. Duncan puts a hand to his chest, touches the
worst of his several lethal wounds. Utter confusion stitches his face.
SILHOUETTE I suppose you’re wondering how a knock- kneed swordsman with
your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day. The figure
extends a hand to Duncan. Duncan hesitantly reaches up…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Are you an angel?</p>
<p><strong>silhouette</strong>: I’ve been called that. And worse.
Duncan�s hand RECOILS– SILHOUETTE Rest assured, I’m neither. He hoists
Duncan to his feet. Duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face
of</p>
<p><strong>connor macleod</strong>: who smiles back with the gift of
untold secrets.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’m Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. And
like you, I have a hard time dying.</p>
<p><strong>int - 747 - day</strong>: Duncan’s now sitting upright in his
seat as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT’S VOICE brings him back to the here and
now.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: We’ll be making our final descent
into New York…</p>
<p><strong>wheels</strong>: SMACK down onto the runway at JFK.</p>
<p><strong>a photograph of duncan</strong>: PULL BACK and see it’s his
passport, held by a US CUSTOMS OFFICER. He lowers the passport and turns
to the long metal case Duncan’s brought with him from the plane.</p>
<p><strong>customs officer</strong>: Would you open the case, please?
Duncan hands the Officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and
opens it. Inside is an old, meticulously cared-for Japanese KATANA
SWORD. Customs Officer studies Duncan’s paperwork, smiles. CUSTOMS
OFFICER Get much use for this?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’d be surprised. Duncan shuts the case
and continues on. Next MAN in line watches Duncan exit as he hands over
his passport. Hang on the PHOTO. We’ll remember those steel- gray
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>int - cab, driving - day</strong>: Duncan watches the passing
scenery. MUSIC and LANDMARKS familiar from the first “Highlander” sweep
past.</p>
<p><strong>ext - new york side-street - day</strong>: Cab WIPES FRAME,
leaving Duncan standing before the charred husk of Connor’s antique
store. Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the
investigators have long since come and gone.</p>
<p><strong>int - antique store</strong>: Door SPLINTERS OPEN. Duncan
steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been
spared. Rachel and Connor’s richly-cultivated collection has been
reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of
overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to
THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually
all that remain of Connor’s home. Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks
down an old charred tapestry, revealing</p>
<p><strong>an inner door</strong>: deliberately hidden from view. He
dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the
heavily- reinforced door. ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR
ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from
centuries of personal history. We’re looking at the sum total of Connor
MacLeod’s existance, stacked floor to ceiling. Duncan moves among the
mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask… a
faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform. He pauses at a painting
of Connor’s wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling
serenely across the ages. Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with
instant familiarity.</p>
<p><strong>int - fencing academy, ravenna italy - day</strong>: Duncan’s
LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall
streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows. Duncan and Connor
face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee
breeches in the manner of the times. Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS
spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry
from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier. A little mustachioed
PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as
Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and
parries.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You’ve improved greatly.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You really think so? Connor executes a
simple combination that sends’Duncan’s sword flying one way, his body
the other.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No. I’m just being gracious. Duncan
recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off
Duncan’s coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan
swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade.
CONNOR Remember, you’re only immortal as long as your head remains
attached to those shoulders. Duncan lunges again. Misses and hits the
deck. CONNOR Which in your case might not be long at all. He puts his
blade to Duncan’s neck. Humor evaporates. CONNOR What we give up to our
adversary in defeat, Duncan… is evervthinq. Duncan stares up at him,
uncomprehending. CONNOR We call it “The Quickening”– our strength, our
knowledge, our life essence– it all flows into the victor, feeds him,
makes him stronger, in ways you can’t possibly comprehend. It’s what
drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better–
smarter– than the rest. He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his
feet. CONNOR Survival. Learn it. Duncan goes on the attack. What he
lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor
sidesteps Duncan’s next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan’s ass
and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages
Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again,
meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly
piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You mind?! Connor clucks his tongue. CONNOR
Allow me. He squares Duncan�s shoulders and steps back. Considers.
CONNOR Unh uh. He steps up and swivels Duncan around until he�s facing
the opposite way. CONNOR If you should ever again find yourself backside
to a blade… just keep this in mind. He proceeds to take Duncan through a
move that’s dazzling in it’s inherent simplicity– a move that winds up
with Duncan’s blade whisking perilously close across Connor’s throat.
CONNOR It’s a coup de fin. He catches Duncan’s sword-fist in his own,
holds it immobile. CONNOR Properly executed, even you cannot prevent
your blade from finding its mark.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Properly executed, we’ll never have this
talk again. Duncan and Connor’s eyes lock. They break.</p>
<p><strong>int - circular room</strong>: Duncan suddenly SIEZES UP with
a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as THE BUZZ. It’s the
sense of another Immortal. He swings around, reaches for his katana and
steps back through the door, swinging it closed as</p>
<p><strong>a young woman</strong>: appears at the top of the stairs. She
saunters toward him, glancing around. She takes her time checking out
the place before stepping up to Duncan. The ragged crop of her hair and
the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti-
beauty. Like a post-nuclear Barbi doll. Duncan regards her, intrigued
and wary.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: A friend. Those two words instantly
recall the mystery voice on the phone. YOUNG WOMAN Or lover. Or wife.
Take your pick. Memory jogs with a sudden lurch.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Kate?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Atta boy. ’cept I’m “Faith” now. Part
of the makeover. Like it? She runs a playful finger across his
chest.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Funny how ’the time slips by, huh? You wake
up one day and ohmigod– Airplanes!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Why’re you here?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Remember our wedding day, Duncan? I do. She
takes him by the hands and leads him into an impromptu dance. FAITH We
danced the “Highland Fling.” She spins under his arm, circles back into
his embrace. FAITH I felt like we were flying. Her sinuous body moves in
perfect sync with his. FAITH And that we’d never come down. She spins
out of his arms again– –and SPIN KICKS him across the FACE. BLOOD
spatters from his nose and mouth. FAITH Of course, we did come down.
Didn’t we? Crashinq. Duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion.
Recovers. They stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Isn’t it obvious? I wanted to see you again.
Duncan tenses at–</p>
<p><strong>the roar of approaching motorcycles.</strong>: His eyes track
the SOUND. It’s directly BELOW him.</p>
<p><strong>ext - street outside antique store</strong>: THREE
MOTORCYCLES hop the curb, SLICE through the open door to the antique
store…</p>
<p><strong>int - antique store</strong>: . . . and SPIRAL up the BACK
STAIRS.</p>
<p><strong>int - loft</strong>: Duncan’s eyes flick upward to a NEW
SOUND, directly above him as–</p>
<p><strong>a fourth bike</strong>: VAULTS the NARROW GAP between
buildings and LANDS. Knobby tires SLAM onto the rooftop, squirrelling
wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop. A jackbooted
heel digs in and grinds to a stop. Biker suddenly BACKWHEELS around,
BLASTS through the</p>
<p><strong>roof access door</strong>: and disappears inside.</p>
<p><strong>two more bikers</strong>: follow suit, SLAMMING DOWN onto the
roof like alien invaders.</p>
<p><strong>int - loft</strong>: Duncan reacts. But it’s not just the
full-throttle howl of approaching bikes. It’s the BUZZ of approaching
IMMORTALS.</p>
<p><strong>the bikers</strong>: now crest the stairs and fan out into
the loft– Same group we saw outside the monastery. Tricked out in
everything from Keds to chainmail, they drag a variety of weapons in
their trailing hands– sword, baseball bat, mace, dao and chain-whip. The
tips make a scraping noise across the floor that’s deliberately
unsettling. They surround Duncan, cutting off any avenue of escape.
Nobody moves or speaks. Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke
engines. Duncan takes a step backward. Looks to Faith.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Who’re they?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: More friends. PAN THE FACES. CARLOS from
Bed-Stuy, BUG from Kyoto, WINSTON from Jamaica, SARGE from Shreveport
and CRACKER BOB from nowhere in particular. And then there’s CALVIN. A
swaggering Immortal from the he’s traded brute force in on a brand new
weapon of choice. A DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Make it pretty now. It’s the bottom of the
ninth. BIKERS DISMOUNT and CONVERGE on Duncan, swinging their weapons to
limber up. Duncan backs away. This is unheard of– Immortals packing like
jackals.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What– it’s a team sport now?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Whole new ballgame. THREE IMMORTALS ATTACK.
They’re good. Duncan’s better. About three times better.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: jockeys his camcorder– GOES IN TIGHT on
Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Sup with the new blood, huh? Who’s gonna lay
him out? Take his secret sauce? YOU, Winston?</p>
<p><strong>winston,</strong>: the tall Jamaican, stands off to one side
watching, the lone holdout. CALVIN Nope. Too proud. Old school.</p>
<p><strong>intercut - video viewfinder</strong>: Image lurches and
jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: How ’bout you, Carlos? You good for it?
Carlos–? CARLOS HURTLES THROUGH FRAME. Lands hard.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’ll catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>sword</strong>: sparking off chainmail.</p>
<p><strong>hands and feet</strong>: pounding flesh.</p>
<p><strong>bodies</strong>: slamming into walls.</p>
<p><strong>blood. mayhem. pain.</strong>: And Calvin, catching it all,
up close and personal. CALVIN Sarge is down. Cracker Bob’s down. But
Carlos got some kick. Still got some kick. Carlos crawls to his feet,
oozing blood and spite. CALVIN Like the man says, you gotta play with
the small hurts. Carlos LUNGES– Duncan lays him out flat again, then
swivels around to face–</p>
<p><strong>bug</strong>: who straightens up to his full five-foot frame.
CALVIN Say hello to my man BUG and his ugly- stick. Bug brandishes a
simple metal ROD with a woven grip. Nothing much to speak of… Until he
squeezes the grip– –and SIX BLADES EJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY. The two on each
end are SWORD BLADES, one for piercing, one for slashing. Jutting
perpendicular to the shaft, like an insane Swiss Army knife, are twin
sets of DAGGERS– two for stabbing and two sawtoothed SWORDBREAKERS. And
then there’s the shaft itself, if you’re in need of a good old-fashioned
battering ram. CALVIN Like it? Came from a Tamaric swordsmith. Who
smoked a lotta very wicked stuff. Bug opens up a multi-pronged BARRAGE
on Duncan. Duncan adapts to the first assault– only to find himself
reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves. CALVIN Uhp— Say welcome
back to Carlos… Carlos cuts in yet again, swinging for the stands. He
fans several times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps
him back onto the floor. Duncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian
lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins. But this time as he SQUEEZES
the release mechanism– –Duncan KICKS IT, shoving it flush against Bug’s
chest.</p>
<p><strong>snick snick</strong>: two PIVOTING DAGGERS slice into the
dumbstruck Immortal. He falls backward WAILING like a stuck pig. A
BOOMING VOICE freezes everyone in their tracks.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s enough. All eyes converge on:</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: who stands at a distance, cloaked in
murky halflight.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: I’m sorry, Duncan. When it comes to
discipline, the first hundred years are the hardest. Duncan lowers his
katana, turns to the Stranger as–</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly
BULLDOZES Duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows. Duncan’s
launched AIRBORNE in a plume of shattered glass, still clutching his
katana. Carlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches
with unvarnished satisfaction as the body SPIKES onto an upright iron
ROD jutting from the construction site below.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Full gainer with a quarter twist. Degree of
difficulty– not very.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: I thought I told you to stop.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Yeah, well. I stopped. STRANGER Are you
challenging my authority? Carlos does his best to ignore him. STRANGER
Because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Hey hey, take it easy, man. STRANGER Is that
clear? In the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window,
the Stranger is right there in his face.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>is that clear?</strong>: Stranger takes Carlos’ sword and
yanks it uo to his own neck -. STRANGER Here’s your chance. Carlos
stares wide-eyed. Pride won’t let him back down. Fear won’t let him
proceed. STRANGER Take it. You won’t have another. We can FEEL the
SUDDEN HAMMERING of Carlos’ HEART.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You’re crazy, man!</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Am I? Then go ahead… Stop the madness.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Hey–</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Or walk away… in perpetual fear of your
own shadow. Tell me, Carlos. Can you live with that? Can you live with
the fear? Can you live with the weakness?</p>
<p><strong>thump-thump-thump-thump–</strong>: STRANGER Weakness, Carlos.
Isn’t that why you’re here with me? Isn’t that why you�re ALL here with
me?! Face it, you’re nothing but. . . . . . cattle. Blood POUNDS in
Carlos’ eyes. He YANKS back the sword, CRIES OUT and SLASHES for the
Stranger’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>close on stranger’s hand</strong>: as it catches his wrist
and diverts the blade around to Carlos’ own throat, wedging it up tight
under his chin. STRANGER God loves you. I don’t. In one vicious
UP-SLICE, Stranger cuts through bone and sinew, stopping just short of a
clean sever. Carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest. STRANGER They
say the worst part, Carlos, is those last few seconds when you find
yourself staring at your own headless body.</p>
<p><strong>snick–</strong>: He sends Carlos’ head tumbling to the floor.
STRANGER Of course it’s pure speculation, since nobody ever lives to
tell about it.</p>
<p><strong>hold on carlos’ eyes</strong>: staring in pure, unknowable
horror at his own body, twitching several yards away. A tiny ARC of
electrical ESSENCE crackles from the neck…</p>
<p><strong>the others</strong>: bear mute witness to the GLOWING
TENDRILS of ENERGY that stutter across the walls and ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>ext - construction site below</strong>: Duncan lies IMPALED
on a JUTTING SHAFT OF RE-BAR as an UNMARKED PANEL VAN screeches INTO
FRAME. His eyes stare sightless upward as</p>
<p><strong>the loft windows</strong>: EXPLODE with unearthly HOWLS of
stretching metal and pulverizing concrete. SHOCKWAVES strafe the walls,
blowing out mortar and brick. POWER LINES SNAP and LASH against the
building, spitting fiery plumes of SPARKS.</p>
<p><strong>int - loft</strong>: Seen from behind, the Stranger absorbs
the QUICKENING in a series of wild electro-shock convulsions.</p>
<p><strong>ext - construction site below</strong>: Several darkly-clad
MEN jump from the panel van and race up to Duncan. With pit crew
efficiency, one takes a mondo set of BOLT CUTTERS to the metal stake
while the others grab Duncan by the arms and ankles. A fourth throws
open the cargo door. Snap-lift… they TOSS Duncan in the back of the
van.</p>
<p><strong>int - loft, same</strong>: Arms outstretched and rigid, head
thrown back in silent rapture, the Stranger RISES slowly off the floor,
suspended Christ-like in the air. BLINDING HALOES of PURE RADIANT
ESSENCE engulf him, a lifeforce beyond human understanding.</p>
<p><strong>the others</strong>: watch transfixed. They’ve seen it all
before, but it never ceases to amaze and terrify them.</p>
<p><strong>darkness</strong>: Which becomes a harsh blast of LIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>duncan’s eyes</strong>: flutter open, squint at the glare.
He’s strapped to the same Giger-like chair, immobilized. Standing around
him are hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is,
essentially, a dungeon. One of them, MATTHEW, steps forward. His
steel-gray eyes are familiar. He’s the one who followed Duncan through
customs. As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a
thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner
forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Watchers? Matthew simply nods.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Watchers observe. They don’t interfere.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: True. And we were more than happy to
perform our traditional function. Believe me, it’s a whole lot easier
charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center
for them. Unfortunately our role has changed somewhat.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Because the rules have been broken.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Not by me.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You’re not the one we’re worried about.
Matthew moves to the other side of the chair. Pegs the arm cuff and
ratchets down a redundant set of bindings. MATTHEW One of your kind has
gone renegade. In doing so he’s gained himself a sizeable advantage. One
that will be impossible to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Nobody’s unbeatable.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: He’s surrounded himself with Immortals
loyal only to him. He uses holy ground as a safe haven. And every head
taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening– hundreds
upon hundreds– taken by just one man. Yes, Duncan. He is unbeatable.
Matthew pours a Scotch. Glenmorangie. Holds it to Duncan’s lips like the
final offering to a condemned man. MATTHEW Worse still, far worse, is
that he’s become a perversion to the Game. And if he prevails, that
perversion will resonate through everything we know. For eternity. In
ways we can’t possibly comprehend. Duncan tugs at his bonds. Knows
what’s in store for him. MATTHEW There must always be two of your kind.
As long as there are two, and they’re kept from fighting, the Prize is
safe. The Sanctuary must continue.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Get yourself another volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: We had a number of “volunteers.” Sadly,
that’s no longer the case. Another WATCHER steps up and forces an IRON
FACE SHACKLE down over Duncan’s head. MATTHEW You’ll be warehoused.
Hidden away. So the Prize can remain safe. Duncan struggles frantically
against his bonds.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’re insane!</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: For the world, Duncan. We do this for the
world… The Watcher takes two large BOLTS and begins to screw the mask
directly into Duncan’s skull.</p>
<p><strong>duncan’s pov:</strong>: BLACKNESS, accompanied by BRIGHT
SEARING FLASHES of</p>
<p><strong>agony.</strong>: MATTHEW’S VOICE Don’t worry. The drugs
should kick in momentarily. All external SOUND is slowly DROWNED OUT by
the POUNDING IN HIS OWN BRAIN. A POUNDING interspersed with jarring,
synaptic flashes of BATTLE. Killing. Dying. Killing again. Dying again.
The recycling nightmare finally RECEDES back into</p>
<p><strong>nothingness.</strong>: Then, a NEW SOUND. Distant. Grind of
metal on bone. Bolts being unscrewed. Iron plate lifts from his eyes,
flood of LIGHT. Once again, Duncan SQUINTS up at a FACE. This time, the
blurred, swimming features of a familiar Irish-American mug.</p>
<p>****: Dawson… JOE DAWSON, familiar to many as Duncan’s one friend
inside the Watchers, smiles back.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: You look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: How… long…?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Week, maybe longer. We can’t talk here. We
gotta go. Dawson reacts to the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DAWSON
Now. Can you walk?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Think so. He takes one step and pitches
forward onto his face. DUNCAN Potent whiskey. He clambers to his feet
and follows Dawson out of the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>ext - armory - night</strong>: Dawson and Duncan emerge from
a nondescript cinderblock armory, an overgrown Cold War relic recently
co-opted by the Watchers. They duck some scurrying guards, plow through
thick underbrush to</p>
<p><strong>a hidden car</strong>: and climb inside.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You knew about The Sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Just because I’m a Watcher, doesn’t mean I’m
always in the loop.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I don’t buy that. Dawson averts his gaze.
Stares ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I really struggled with it, y’know, the idea
of keeping guys on ice like that. But I couldn’t argue with the logic.
Least not ’til they went after you. Guess that put it a little too close
to home.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I owe you. Dawson slides Duncan’s katana out
from under the seat. Hands it over.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Do me a favor, buddy. Live to pay me
back.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What happened to the bodies? Dawson winces
slightly. Keeps driving. DUNCAN C’mon, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Listen– I got you outta one jam. Don’t push
your luck.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I need to see them.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: They’re dead. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Was one of them Connor MacLeod?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Let me see the bodies.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: The heads are gone. You really don’t wanna
go there.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I have to, Joe. I have to know. Dawson jerks
the car to a sudden shuddering stop.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Alright… Alright– If I tell you, that’s it,
I’m outta here! You’re on your own! I can’t be a part of this, OK?!</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: Dawson stares at Duncan. A beat, then:</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Fuck. I’m a part of it. He throws the car
back into gear and fishtails back onto the road.</p>
<p><strong>a view through the windshield</strong>: of a forlorn and
forgotten CEMETERY. Nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and
some trampled barbed wire.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: It was a Christian burial. Decent. They said
all the right words.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I can’t begin to tell you how reassuring
that is. Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>wide</strong>: Dawson pulls over. He and Duncan get out of
the car.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Needless to say, with a dozen unexplainable
corpses, they had to go a bit off the beaten track.</p>
<p><strong>ext - cemetery - sunset</strong>: From here it looks like
just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble.</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: Duncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow
incline. DAWSON What do you think you’re gonna find when you get up
there?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I’m not digging. Get that through your skull
right now. Not these hands…</p>
<p><strong>cresting the ridge</strong>: Twelve freshly-mounded graves
come into view, gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds, each set
off by a simple wooden cross. Duncan stops when he reaches the first
grave. Stiffens.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: What? Duncan remains frozen, staring,
seemingly at nothing. DAWSON My dog used to do that with locked closets.
I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Shh. Dawson listens. Nothing but the soft
moan of WIND. DUNCAN He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Tell me I’m not here for a seance. Duncan
squints. Feels the BUZZ. Slight, but unmistakable.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees:</strong>: A row of stunted oaks, thick and
gnarled againt the setting sun.</p>
<p><strong>closer. . .</strong>: Standing against the trunk, silhouette
on silhouette, is the ghostly form of a MAN. Barely discernible, his
features are hidden in shadow. Duncan slowly approaches the figure.
Dawson hangs back, nervous and slightly twitchy.</p>
<p><strong>closer still…</strong>: The figure steps up to greet Duncan.
Sunlight brightens the face of</p>
<p><strong>connor macleod</strong>: who smiles as he embraces Duncan in
the traditional bear- crush of Scottish clansmen.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Sorry I missed your funeral.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: All told, it was a bit underwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: So it would seem. They break. The brief joy
suddenly drains from Connor’s face– his eyes speak of diffuse, faraway
suffering.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab.
Connor’s expression hardens.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You need to know something… He steps up to
Duncan, locks eyes. CONNOR Every life I touch ends. Brutally. And for no
reason. It’s a curse that’s followed me for centuries. I can’t outrun it
and I can’t outlive it. You’re my last friend in this world, Duncan. I
left for your own good. It was better that you didn’t know where.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: The Sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yes. The Sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: But you escaped.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No, I didn’t escape… FLASH BACK TO THE
SANCTUARY as the STRANGER moves toward a shackled Connor MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: …I was freed. As before, the immobilized
Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: You’ll know soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>connor’s pov - through the bottom edge of his
faceplate</strong>: All Connor can see is the Stranger’s HAND as it
reaches down and PULLS THE PIN from one of Connor’s arm shackles. The
cuff FALLS OPEN. Stranger turns away. A beat later come the unmistakable
SOUNDS of SLAUGHTER that fill the room to a DEAFENING CRESCENDO.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I couldn’t see the slaughter. I only heard
it.</p>
<p><strong>back to cemetery:</strong>: We can still see the agony
playing out in Connor’s eyes. He turns away, sees</p>
<p><strong>joe dawson</strong>: still standing on the ridge, swatting at
the occasional deerfly.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: The reason I didn’t become your replacement.
Dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside
down.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What’s he doing now?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Sand in the shoe would be my guess. Connor
suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to</p>
<p><strong>the next hillside</strong>: and the FAINT SOUND OF
APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. He stiffens.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You were followed. One by one, a HALF-DOZEN
MOTORCYCLISTS crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing
stop.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Yeah. I was meaning to tell you about those
guys. Dawson fumbles to put his leg back on. Hops a full 360 as he
watches the intruders surround them.</p>
<p><strong>two more</strong>: approach on foot, following the same path
Duncan and Dawson took. One is Faith. The other, The Stranger. Except
he’s no stranger to Connor MacLeod. Far from it. Connor goes rigid.
Breathing stops. His nightmare’s finally taken human form. MOVE IN for
our first clear look at</p>
<p><strong>jacob kase</strong>: striding forward, bigger than death. His
is a face hewn by God�s sharpest blade, every angle cold, remorseless,
Puritannical. As before, he’s clad in basic black, accented by the stark
white of a priest’s collar.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Jacob Kase… Connor edges back his coat. Hand
seeks out the grip of his sword. Duncan grabs his arm.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Walk away, Duncan. Kase and Faith continue
toward them. Connor’s rage seems to ratchet up with every step.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’re on holy ground. Remember the rules…
Pure, radiating hate seethes in Connor’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The rules be damned. Kase stops, inches from
Connor’s face. Cooly regards the sword.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Look at you. You’d think after half a
millenium, you’d learn to keep that you’d learn to keep that temper of
yours in check. Gone is any trace of brogue. He’s a fully-assimilated
New Yorker now. Connor’s fingers tighten around the swordgrip…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Just tell me where, Kase.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: If all I wanted was to kill you, you’d have
been dead a very long time ago, Connor. Something roils under Kase’s
controlled exterior. A rage every bit as consuming as Connor’s. KASE But
your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered.
FLASH TO SEVERAL OF GLENFINNAN’S VILLAGERS being MOWED DOWN by Connor’s
mindless fury. KASE It couldn’t even begin to appease mine. FLASH TO
KASE as he drops to his knees, gagging blood, RUN THROUGH by Connor’s
blade. KASE Worst of all, you murdered a man of God. Who raised me as
his son. FLASH TO A FATHER RAINEY as Connor brings his sword CLEAVING
DOWN on him. KASE …and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for
that.</p>
<p><strong>aftermath of massacre</strong>: Scattered wisps of smoke
gambol across the demolished commons, leading up to the CORPSE of JACOB
KASE. KASE What you never could have expected was that you’d leave
behind this one humble servant… Kase’s body lies there as cold as the
Highland dawn. KASE …who would trade eternity itself to make you
pay.</p>
<p><strong>his eyes</strong>: snap open. And we’re once again
TRANSPORTED BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>ext - cemetery - day</strong>: Kase steps closer, revelling
in this moment.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Look back over the endless travesties of your
life and you’ll see me. Always there, waiting in the shadows. When
friends and lovers are wiped from your sight, I’m there. KASE When those
you cherish die abruptly and for no reason, I’m there. And when a
handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own
private hell… Guess who? He walks a full circle around Connor. All the
while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan. KASE
But if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you’re wrong. Very…
Very… Wrong. Kase turns back to Faith. Pulls his sword and without
warning SLICES it across her throat. Faith reflexively GASPS, stumbles
backward, leaving–</p>
<p><strong>a wood and silver crucifix</strong>: dangling on Kase’s
swordtip.</p>
<p><strong>follow the crucifix</strong>: as he swings it around and
offers it up to Connor.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Thought you might be wanting this. I kept it
for you… FLASH TO CONNOR’S MOTHER, bound to the stake as Kase rips the
crucifix from her neck.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: Connor stares down at the crucifix
now in his open palm. KASE For old times’ sake. Kase puts an arm around
Faith. KASE Want to find me again, Connor? Just put your hands together…
KASE And pray. He gives Faith a little shove and they both start
downhill.</p>
<p><strong>the surrounding bikers</strong>: gun their engines and ride
off on billowing plumes of dust. Connor makes no move to follow.
Strangely silent and impassive, he’s like a warrior gutted by an
invisible sword. Duncan puts a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Whatever it is… Connor swipes away Duncan’s
hand, starts walking. DUNCAN I can help you, Connor. Connor stops,
swivels back. Eyes dead.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Nobody can help me. He walks off alone, a
ghost against a sea of gravestones,</p>
<p><strong>connor–</strong>: Duncan watches his friend depart, helpless.
Turning back, he sees</p>
<p><strong>faith and kase</strong>: stopped halfway down the hill. They
seem to be arguing. Kase turns abruptly and strides off.</p>
<p><strong>close on faith</strong>: She stands there a moment, sullenly
rubbing her throat. Duncan’s VOICE spins her back around.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Problem?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a
sword at me. Goes a long way back. Their eyes fix on one another. Air
thickens. Buzzes with electricity.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Just one question. After all these years. .
. Why him? Faith glances down at Kase, who stands waiting at the base of
the hill. Considers.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Because I’ve never known anyone who had such
an amazing capacity for hate. Except me. On that, she brushes past
Duncan and rejoins Kase.</p>
<p><strong>ext - irish countryside, 17th century - day</strong>: Duncan
and Connor ride side by side on horseback. They reach a</p>
<p><strong>riverbank</strong>: where a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly
CONSORT are detained at a crude wooden TOLL GATE. Eight or nine
disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage. Connor rides up
to what would appear to be the LEADER. He has the most teeth.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>highwayman</strong>: The lady here refuses to pay her
toll.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Toll for what?</p>
<p><strong>highwayman</strong>: Passage over the bridge. Connor cranes
his eyes, upriver and down.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I see no bridge.</p>
<p><strong>highwayman</strong>: What do you think pays for the bridge?
Connor considers, then turns back to the lady with a shrug.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The man has a point. Despite her sweeping
auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as
FAITH from an earlier era. Her original name is CATHERINE MARY
DEVANEY.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: These men are liars and scoundrels.
They�ve preyed upon us three years running.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This true?</p>
<p><strong>highwayman</strong>: A good sturdy bridge is not an overnight
accomplishment, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Exactly what, may I ask, have you
accomplished so far?</p>
<p><strong>highwayman</strong>: The tollgate. Duncan trots around the
tollgate and up alongside Connor. He leans over to the highwayman.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Excuse me, but by whose authority do you
act?</p>
<p><strong>highwayman</strong>: By deed of the King.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Might I see that? Highwayman slowly unravels
the parchment scroll. The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words
copied by an illiterate. DUNCAN Does the King always sign his name with
an “X”? Highwayman’s cronies reach for their swords.</p>
<p><strong>highwayman</strong>: He was in a hurry. All eyes hover on
Duncan’s reaction. Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine
and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment’s notice.
Duncan tracks them with his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Busy man, the King. I suggest you pay the
gentlemen and be on your way.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: His deed is a fake!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: That’s a matter of opinion.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You, Sir, are no better than they!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: That’s also a matter of opinion. Shall we?
Connor sizes up his young protege’. Gives a dubious nod.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Lead on.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You can’t just leave!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’re right… He tosses a handful of gold
coins to the Highwayman. DUNCAN Good luck with the bridge. He kicks his
horse into a brisk trot. Connor reluctantly follows suit. They cross the
river through ankle-deep water.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I can’t believe you gave those bastards your
money.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It wasn’t my money. Duncan pulls a cinched
canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his overcoat. DUNCAN It was
theirs. RACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses
and riding hard in frantic pursuit. They hit the river at a gallop,
kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water. DUNCAN By the time they
reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harm�s
way. The pursuers close the gap in seconds. Connor grins approvingly.
Draws his sword and glances over at Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Shall we? Duncan FLICKS his own sword, lets
the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical. He nods
back at Connor.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Let’s. Together, they whirl around to face
the onrushing horde.</p>
<p><strong>they battle</strong>: in the middle of the shallow river.
Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals. The spray of
water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an
operatic crescendo. Duncan’s improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters
three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER. This
time it’s Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse
and goes down, losing his sword in the river.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: suddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at
his opponent like a throwing dagger.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: whistles past the dumbstruck highwayman’s
head. Which was not the intended target… . . .as we discover when we
follow it’s end-over-end flight. . . . . . straight into CONNOR’S
OUTSTRETCHED HAND. Connor parries his attackers, drives them backward
onto their asses, then swivels around and TOSSES the sword back to</p>
<p><strong>duncan,</strong>: who catches it, ducks the highwayman’s next
swing and swiftly sends him packing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: recovers his own sword, which is enough to
send the last of their attackers into a full-on, stumbling retreat. They
both stand watching as</p>
<p><strong>the carriage</strong>: jostles safely across the river.</p>
<p><strong>close on catherine</strong>: as she looks back at Duncan. She
gives Duncan a knowing smile that’s as innocent as it is seductive.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You know that stirring in your gut? It’s not
just simple lust, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Ah, but do you really?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: as she and Kase drive away from the cemetery
in a late model convertible.</p>
<p><strong>ext - cemetery - sunset</strong>: Joe Dawson walks up to
Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I feel like I stepped in on the wrong party.
Duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next
rise.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ext - bar - night</strong>: We recognize this place. It’s
where Connor and Duncan shared a last drink together. Duncan and Joe
Dawson now hunch over that same bar, staring into their drinks.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I swear, the man’s a walking ghost.</p>
<p><strong>ext - sidewalk - night</strong>: FEET pound pavement.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Whatever it is he’s carrying around inside
him, it’s like he’s dead already. Glare of streetlights rake across
Connor’s face, his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more
powerful than sight. Connor bumps shoulders with a passing
PEDESTRIAN.</p>
<p><strong>pedestrian</strong>: Eyy man– watch it. He continues on,
oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>int - bar - night</strong>: Duncan turns to Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: There are things you do in this life that
damn you for eternity. They can’t be changed. And they can’t be undone.
You carry these things to the grave, Joe, in the hopes that maybe, just
maybe, you’ll find some peace there. Some relief, even if it’s oblivion.
But Immortals don’t die. We just go on reliving our sins. Over and over
again.</p>
<p><strong>ext - another street - later</strong>: Connor stops. Lifts
his eyes to the light.</p>
<p><strong>a solitary stone church</strong>: stands before him in a bed
of crawling mist. It seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight
around it.</p>
<p><strong>int - bar - night</strong>: Duncan downs the last of his
drink, shoves off from the bar. Dawson glances warily up at him.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Where now?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: There were two places I figured Connor was
likely to go. One of ’em was here.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: And the other?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’re the “Watcher.” You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ext - stone church - night</strong>: Connor climbs the steps,
presses through the heavy wooden doors…</p>
<p><strong>int - church</strong>: . . . and prowls slowly through the
dimly-lit interior. Icon SHADOWS loom large and menacing.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut:</strong>: He moves along the stations of the
cross.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut:</strong>: He’s stalking through the nave.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut:</strong>: Barging into the sacristy.</p>
<p><strong>ext - dawson’s car, driving - night</strong>: Dawson’s car
screams past with a doppler howl.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: It’s an old abandoned church just off
Canal…</p>
<p><strong>int - dawson’s car - same</strong>: Dawson’s behind the
wheel, gunning through narrow back streets.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: . . . Perfect safe haven for a so-called
priest, huh? “Our Lady of Sorrows.” Kinda has a nice ring to it. He
fishtails around the next corner. Recovers. DAWSON I’ll tell ya this– if
he’s going after Kase, he’s in for a rude awakening. The man’s
untouchable.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: So they tell me.</p>
<p><strong>int - church sanctuary - night</strong>: Connor stops before
the darkened altar, senses BUZZING.</p>
<p><strong>the shadowed crucifix</strong>: stirs. Arms lift in the
darkness. Jacob Kase steps down off the cross, lingers in shadow.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: I would grant you absolution. If I were a
better man. He turns and disappears out the back. Connor follows. Right
past</p>
<p><strong>kase’s posse of immortals</strong>: scattered throughout the
pews, who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to
follow.</p>
<p><strong>winston,</strong>: the tall Jamaican, leans over to
Faith.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: You know we’re next, don’t you? Faith
lowers the book she’s reading– the Holy Bible. Looks up.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Our days are numbered. You can see it in
Kase’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Do you believe in a hereafter, Winston?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: All I know is I won’t be hereafter Jacob
Kase gets through with me. And that’s all I care about right now. Faith
leans back against the hardback pew, closes her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ext - rear of church - night</strong>: Kase strides just
beyond the perimeter of the church grounds, then turns back to Connor.
Connor draws his sword, moves on Kase.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: The ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood
in anger. It defiled their sense of purpose. Of course they’re also
somewhat extinct. He steps fearlessly up to Connor, places his neck
against Connor’s swordblade… . . . just like he did with a certain late
Immortal named Carlos.</p>
<p><strong>close on kase’s sword</strong>: He opens his fingers and lets
the sword DROP. It clatters useless to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Would you slaughter an unarmed man of God
again, Connor? Would that finally put your soul to rest? Then go ahead.
Send me home. BLOOD POUNDS with the rage pulsing through Connor’s veins.
KASE What’s stopping you? Guilt? The nagging sense that maybe you, more
than I, deserve to die? Dawson’s car pulls up in the background. Duncan
jumps out. KASE Or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve?
Connor’s sword digs into Kase’s neck. Breaks skin.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Don’t do it, Connor.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Keep back.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: You heard him. No Immortal can interfere with
another’s duel.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: He’s playing you! Step back onto holy ground
before it’s too late– Kase faces back to Connor.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Go ahead– what better chance than now? Take
your shot.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Don’t listen to him!</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Do it. For your sweet mother…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Caiolin burns at the stake. Suddenly
startled, KASE Your Huguenot bitch in Navarre…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: rears back, THROWS Suddenly startled, the
HORSE bearing a FRENCH DUCHESS her to the ground, breaking her neck.
KASE Brenda Wyatt…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: BRENDA WYATT is seen walking in CENTRAL PARK.
A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER MOWS HER DOWN from behind. KASE Rachel
Ellenstein…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: RACHEL is BLOWN APART in the antique store
she shared with Connor. KASE Tell me– do they even begin to equal the
devastation of an entire village? BLADE TREMBLES in Connor’s hands. Kase
presses his neck even harder against Connor’s blade. BLOOD trickles down
his neck. KASE So close. Soooo close… Duncan stands by, helpless to
intervene. KASE Look at you. Even now, you’re afraid you’ll lose. That’s
your true fear isn’t it? Oh, it’s not the dying, my friend. I know that.
That would be a blessing. It’s the thought of giving up your essence to
me. Making me even stronger by it. One look in Connor’s eyes and you
know he’s right. KASE What’s wrong? Don’t you want to be inside me?
Connor slowly LOWERS his sword… and FLICKS Kase’s discarded sword back
up into his hands. Kase simply smiles and takes position. Duncan can
only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving
Connor backward with dazzling – almost casual– swordplay.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: I’ve taken more heads than you can possibly
imagine. His sword whistles across Connor’s face, opens a THREE INCH
GASH over his eye. KASE Do you really want a taste of all those
accumulated quickenings? Connor stumbles backward again, blinded by his
own dripping blood. Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he’s doomed. Duncan
knows it too. And it’s killing him to watch. Still Connor won’t go down
easy. He manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes.
Kase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on
Connor’s torso, crosshatching him in blood. Connor lunges wildly. Kase
parries effortlessly. Kase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor.
It’s like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are
Kase’s strikes. Constantly off balance, Connor still manages to NICK
Kase in the cheek. KASE I’d almost forgotten what that felt like. Thank
you. He now turns it on full. Drives Connor up against a wall and pins
him with his swordtip. His eyes go impossibly cold.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: I want you to think back to this moment in the
endless nights ahead. And know that every time you close your eyes, from
now to eternity, I’ll be there. Ripping apart the ones you care about
most. He removes his sword and steps back. KASE It’s not over, Connor
MacLeod. It will never, never be over. He turns and walks back toward
the church. Duncan does not step aside to let him pass– their shoulders
bump. KASE You, on the other hand, are on borrowed time. He continues
on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding
spectacle. One-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind
Kase. Connor stares into Duncan’s eyes as if wanting to say something.
Can’t. Instead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot.
Feeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over
at</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: who stands at a distance. Watching him. As
their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding
blackness.</p>
<p><strong>a bearded brawler</strong>: CRASHES DOWN onto a wooden table.
He takes the table cloth with him as he TUMBLES head over heels onto the
floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage. Miraculously he spills not
one drop of precious Guinness, which he hoists in a cheery salute
to:</p>
<p><strong>the bride and groom</strong>: who sit laughing in the eye of
an Irish hurricane. DUNCAN MACLEOD and CATHERINE MARY DEVANEY– aka
“Faith”– are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness. Things have
progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing.</p>
<p><strong>brawler</strong>: Let’s have at it! They kiss to a CHORUS of
BOOS. So this time they REALLY KISS. Crowd goes wild.</p>
<p><strong>around them</strong>: REVELERS DANCE and FIGHT with equal
abandon, making it almost impossible to tell the difference. But they
stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial.</p>
<p><strong>the bearded brawler</strong>: spears his mug into the air
like a royal scepter.</p>
<p><strong>brawler</strong>: Happy is the bride that sees the sun! Sorry
the corpse that sees the rain!</p>
<p><strong>close on beer mug</strong>: framed in a perfect BEAM of
SUNLIGHT streaming through an open window.</p>
<p><strong>follow the sunbeam to:</strong>: KATE who smiles back with
her own inner radiance. Bedecked in flowers, her brown hair sweets low
over white lace shoulders and cream skin. She leans over RAUCOUS CHEERS
and kisses Duncan, provoking a new RIOT of and UPRAISED GLASSES.</p>
<p><strong>the pipers</strong>: resplendent in their Celtic kilts,
launch into the “Highland Fling. Kate is instantly YANKED up onto her
feet and into a ROUSING JIG. Before Duncan can protest, he’s HOISTED
from his seat and FLUNG onto the dance floor. Duncan and Kate link arms,
goaded on by a circle of shouting, stumbling CLAPPERS. With each new
upshift in tempo, they spin faster and faster until they’re hanging on
for dear life.</p>
<p><strong>sight and sound</strong>: gradually blur into a queasy sense
of vertigo. But for Duncan, it’s not just the headstrong mix of drink
and passion. It’s the BUZZ of another Immortal. He spins to a stop as
his eyes come to rest on</p>
<p><strong>connor macleod</strong>: who enters the room on a wave of
silence. Duncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps
him in a bear hug.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: About time. I was beginning to wonder.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I was on a junk in the South China Sea when
I got your notice. 12 hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: How…?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Don’t ask. Kate spins by on the arm of a new
partner.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re next, Connor MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: That better be no idle threat. Duncan
watches Kate with a rapturous smile.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Well, I finally did it!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: So it would appear.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What do you think of her?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You know that’s not an easy answer. The edge
in his voice is not lost on Duncan. CONNOR Outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext - porch - night</strong>: Connor stands with Duncan at
the railing, staring out into the encroaching night.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You know she’s like us.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Yes. I sensed it the day we met her.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: So you know that, like us, her immortality
can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death. Duncan looks off,
as if purging the thought from his head. CONNOR It’s what makes warriors
of us all, Duncan. Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Yes. And without such a death, she’ll simply
grow old and die like any other. Is that what you dragged me out here to
tell me? Connor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest
pocket. It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken
threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Many years after I was married, I came home
to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one
hand… and her hair in the other.</p>
<p><strong>flash to:</strong>: HEATHER, early-forties, her hair shorn to
the scalp. She looks up at Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter
smile. CONNOR At first I was scared. Scared that she’d gone mad. And
then angry, as if she’d somehow meant to hurt me by it.</p>
<p><strong>back to connor and duncan:</strong>: CONNOR When I asked her
why she’d done such a thing to herself, her answer cut me to the quick.
She said it was the one part of her that would not age. It would forever
remain the same as when I first fell in love with her.</p>
<p><strong>flash to:</strong>: CONNOR burying Heather in a simple grave
overlooking their home. Tears streak his face. He sinks to his knees in
unspeakable anguish. CONNOR And that’s how she wanted me to remember
her.</p>
<p><strong>back to connor and duncan:</strong>: Connor closes his
fingers around the braid. Squeezes. CONNOR It’s all I have now.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I love Kate. I’ll hold on to her as long as
I can. That’s all I can do. Kate can be seen through the window behind
them, exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: If that’s your intent, so be it. Duncan
swings over the rail and hops off the porch. Takes to the ground in long
angry strides.</p>
<p><strong>ext - cobbled street - night</strong>: Conner walks double
time to catch up with him.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Because I once loved a woman more than life
itself. And I watched her die. Unlike you, I had no other choice.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: And I have a choice?! What would you have me
tell her?!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’d tell her nothing. She wouldn’t believe
you. They never do when it involves themselves.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Then I can do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: She’s in the flower of her youth. Enjoy the
moment and let it pass. If you think you can. Duncan suddenly grabs
Connor’s shoulder, spins him around.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’d have me kill her?! Is that it?! Is
that what you came all this way to tell me on my WEDDING NIGHT?!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’d have you do what your heart– and our
conscience– demand. Duncan settles. Searches his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: And if it were you in my place? Connor
ponders. Then shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I thank God I never had the choice. He
listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising
WIND. CONNOR Tell Catherine I’m sorry I couldn’t stay longer. He clasps
Duncan by the forearm. Then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane
leading from the wedding party.</p>
<p><strong>int - soho hotel - night</strong>: Duncan lies sleepless in a
nouveau-stark hotel room, somewhere in the bowels of Manhattan. A
half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company. The door CREAKS
OPEN, casting a single ribbon of light across the room. It WIDENS to
REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN. Duncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep.
She pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed. Duncan remains still,
breathing heavily. The woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as
if quietly studying Duncan– –then swings her leg up and straddles him.
Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted
eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair. She says nothing, her
expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing
betrays her tension. Instead, she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM.
Passionately. Duncan responds in kind. AS if powerless to do anything
else… LIGHTNING stitches the sky outside as– They embrace. Bodies
entwine with an urgency that builds with the STORM raging outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext - empty field - night</strong>: ANGRY SHEETS OF RAIN rake
the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly through calf-deep mud. Still in
his wedding arb, he’s thoroughly drenched, as if he’s been wandering
this way for hours.</p>
<p><strong>int - rowhouse - night</strong>: The last of the guests have
gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale. Only Kate remains
upright, her face etched with sober dread as</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: appears in the doorway, rivulets of water
pouring off his shoulders and brow. For a while they just stare at one
another, each lost to his own sense of foreboding. Kate is the first to
speak. Despite her stoic veneer, her voice comes out small and
terrified.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: If this is wrong, Duncan, tell me now. Saying
nothing, Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his
own.</p>
<p><strong>int - bedroom - night</strong>: CANDLES flicker in the
storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed windows. Kate lays Duncan’s
rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked
for the very first time. Duncan reaches out to touch her. She trembles.
Gently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan
removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise. Then guides her
down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut
wildflowers.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: clasp, fingers dig into skin. Whatever
refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned. She
arches up under Duncan, puts her lips to his ear.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’ll love you forever. On an OMINOUS
THUNDERCLAP–</p>
<p><strong>int - soho hotel - night</strong>: We’re back in the present.
Little has changed but the sheets. And the fury of their lovemaking.
Each new THUNDERCRACK highlights a different aspect of their hunger–
their wet, glistening bodies STROBING FASTER AND FASTER until the act
itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place.</p>
<p><strong>flash frames</strong>: stutter inside the lightning:</p>
<p><strong>silken hair</strong>: coursing over cream-colored breasts and
a simple pewter cross.</p>
<p><strong>eyes</strong>: similar in shape and color, that shift from
painted to plain…</p>
<p><strong>fingernails</strong>: that toggle between neo-goth BLACK and
natural pink…</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: throws back her head, biting back the
shudders of release… . . . and sinks down into the bed with a drawn
sigh.</p>
<p><strong>int - dublin bedroom - night</strong>: A SHADOW darkens Kate
as she sleeps. It lingers there, deadly still.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: stands over her, gripped by indecision. The
fateful choice tears at him, even as he holds a DAGGER over her
gently-rising chest. His hand TREMBLES.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>kate’s eyes</strong>: SNAP OPEN as the DAGGER PLUNGES INTO
HER HEART. For an instant their eves meet. And in that single shattering
moment, Duncan knows he chose wrong. It’s not just terror that passes
through Kate’s eyes. It’s the incomprehensible pain of betrayal. Kate
gasps once, jerks and settles. Lies there dead, blood pooling across her
nightgown. Duncan stares down at her body, numb.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m sorry… On that look we TRANSITION BACK
TO:</p>
<p><strong>int - hotel - night</strong>: The pain imprints on Duncan as
if he’s still clutching the knife.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m sorry. Whatever passion stirred Faith
moments before is gone without a trace. Her eyes are as cold and empty
as the dead Kate.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You had no right.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I was doing it for you. For us.</p>
<p><strong>int - dublin bedroom - night</strong>: Kate CONVULSES BACK TO
LIFE, eyes wild, insane. Duncan reaches out to her, which only sends her
reeling further into panic delirium. She swats at him, punching
flailing…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Now you’re an immortal. Like me. It was the
only way… Words fall on deaf ears. She wrenches out of his grip.
Stumbles for the door, drenched in her own blood. Leaves Duncan standing
mindblown in her wake.</p>
<p><strong>ext - dublin streets - night</strong>: Kate flees through wet
empty streets– barefoot, nightgown ripped and bloody, face contorted
like a madwoman. Breath comes in ragged, whimpering gasps. She trips,
falls. Comes up running.</p>
<p><strong>back to present:</strong>: Faith climbs off the bed, throws
on Duncan’s shirt, whirls back, tears streaking her face like
warpaint.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You wanted this! I never asked for eternity!
You forced it on me!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Would you have really understood?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Understood? Which part?! The part about never
having children? Or the endless, numbing sameness of it all? Or maybe
you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize you’re nothing
but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by
so fast they don’t even count anymore! She wraps her arms around herself
as if to stem the escaping demons. Duncan remains silent, taking it all
in. FAITH Here’s the kicker, Duncan. I came here for one reason and one
reason only. To see if I could feel again. Anything. She walks out,
leaving the door hanging wide in her wake.</p>
<p><strong>int - hallway</strong>: Faith reaches for the stairwell door
as– –DUNCAN’S ARM LANCES OUT, holding it shut.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m watching my best friend driven insane by
something that happened four centuries ago. And there’s nothing I can do
to stop it. Because those people are dead and nobody can bring them
back. Faith struggles to open the door. Duncan holds firm. DUNCAN But
I’m lucky. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m lucky because my crime can still be
forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: As long as you’re still alive, there’s at
least the chance. It could take years. Centuries even. It may never
happen… Faith is now PUSHING FURIOUSLY on the door. DUNCAN But at least
I can still carry the hope inside me. That’s one blessing of
immortality. There’s always tomorrow. He lets go of the door and steps
back. DUNCAN Even for you. Faith shoves her way past him and disappears
into the stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>ext - manhattan skyline - night</strong>: CONNOR MACLEOD
stands on a ROOFTOP, sword in hand, face upturned to the bitter heavens.
Stinging WIND and RAIN slash at his face. He doesn’t even blink.</p>
<p><strong>ext - near church - night</strong>: Seen through a CAMCORDER
VIEWFINDER, our roving POV wends its way past a couple fixing junkies up
to a</p>
<p><strong>garage</strong>: where WINSTON hunkers over his bike making
repairs. Kase’s church looms in the background like a veiled threat.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Win-ston.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Shut that thing off.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hey, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>shut it off!</strong>: SCREEN BLACKS OUT as Winston slams his
hand over the lens, ENDING CAMCORDER POV. Calvin sets it down.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Awright…</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: I’m out. I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You’re out. You’re out… You don’t g&amp;z
out.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You saw what he did to Carlos. He’s Genghis
the fucking Hun, man. You live his way or you die your way. Be grateful
you got the choice. Winston looks off.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: We could take him.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Huh? Say how much you value your life?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Forty-three guineas. Saw the bill of sale
myself. Kingston Jamaica, August 14th, 1813.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Sorry there, Cinque’, but I got a bigger
price goin on this unit.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: I watched Connor MacLeod stand up to Kase
tonight. Got me thinking.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What about.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: That maybe my soul wasn’t part of the deal
after all. Calvin considers his point.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You really think we can take him?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: The man can’t stop a bullet. I know that
much. But I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah and who takes his head, huh? Gets that
bucket fulla lucky charms. You, Mr Cool? Who’s gonna be master then?</p>
<p><strong>insert - calvin’s camera</strong>: and that little glowing
RECORD LIGHT…</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: as he reaches the crest of the cemetery
ridge. He sags against a solitary windswept oak, slides down until he’s
sitting cross-legged at the base of the tree. Eyes wide, unblinking.</p>
<p><strong>before him</strong>: stand those TWELVE DEAD IMMORTALS from
The Sanctuary, directly over their burial plots. Their heads are
missing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: looks on impassively. Even as–</p>
<p><strong>thousands more</strong>: now stipple the barren landscape.
All headless, in period dress spanning untold centuries. The forgotten
casualties of an endless, impossible war. Connor nods solemnly.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Soon. He blinks. The specters are gone.</p>
<p><strong>time lapse on connor:</strong>: DAY becomes NIGHT becomes
DAY. And still he sits there, unmoved, as if ready to embrace the rest
of eternity from this one desolate spot.</p>
<p><strong>ext - cemetery ridge - day</strong>: Connor remains sitting
against the tree as</p>
<p><strong>a shadow</strong>: slices over him. He slowly tilts his gaze
upward. Squints.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: There’s supposed to be an end to all this,
right? A final answer… Duncan slides down next to him. Gazes out at the
trackless ocean.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Isn’t that the “prize” we’re all butchering
each other to win?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I already know the answer. The “prize”– the
real prize– is just to close your eyes and see nothing.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I don’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You think the Game is still about good
against evil? A better world? Look around. Who among us really deserves
to win?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Not Jacob Kase.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: And who’s going to stop him? You? Me?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: There has to be a way. Connor looks off.
Nods.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Oh, there’s a way, kinsman. There’s a way.
But I don’t believe you have the guts to take it.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Try me. Connor stands up. Offers a hand to
Duncan. Hauls him upright.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Alright then.</p>
<p><strong>he suddenly lashes out with his sword.</strong>: Duncan
barely catches Connor’s blade with his own.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What’re you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Don’t you know? The better of us will take
the other’s gift. Pray it’ll be enough. Duncan lowers his blade.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Then you’ll die. Again, Connor STRIKES.
Again, Duncan barely escapes with his head. And settles into a fighting
stance.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It can’t end like this!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: It already has. Goodbye, brother. He SWINGS
FOR DUNCAN’S NECK. Steel RINGS against steel. Clansman against
clansman.</p>
<p><strong>int - church sanctuary - day</strong>: Faith sits in a center
pew, head bowed, deep in thought. Or prayer. Hard to tell with somebody
like Faith. Kase sits down beside her.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: You were with him. He curls his nose, as if he
can still smell the sin. KASE Woman is a temple built upon a sewer.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Glad I can help you feel a bit better about
yourself there, Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Remember what you were when I first found you?
A whore. Now look. A liberated woman.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Fuck you. Kase runs a delicate finger across
her neck.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Be grateful I don’t this minute remove your
pretty little heafod.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Holy ground, lover. It’s a bitch, ain’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>ext - cemetery ridge - day</strong>: Two figures dot the
faraway ridge as the savage music of their swordplay PEALS out across
the barren countryside.</p>
<p><strong>moving closer,</strong>: we watch these timeless warriors
exchange strikes that would drive lesser men into the ground. Each
gifted in his own way, neither gaining full advantage over the other… .
. . they both gradually succumb to EXHAUSTION.</p>
<p><strong>closer:</strong>: Connor and Duncan finally lower their
swords, panting and spent.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Enough?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Enough… And that’s as much as either can say
as they suck back great gulping lungfulls of air. A little color finally
returns to Duncan’s cheeks. He mops his face with his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Next time I won’t hold back.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Nor I. Dragging his sword like a half-ton
barbell, Duncan turns and makes his way back toward the “resting
tree.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: closes his eyes and HOISTS HIS SWORD… CONNoR
Remember well, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: feels, more than sees, the ONCOMING BLADE.
He turns into the ARC of CONNOR’S SWING–</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: He reacts on pure instinct, SWORD
LIFTING, BODY PIVOTING with the DRIVING FORCE of CONNOR’S THRUST…</p>
<p><strong>connor’s sword</strong>: as it GRAZES Duncan�s side.</p>
<p><strong>duncan’s katana</strong>: SWINGS UP with the same vicious
thrust, CATCHES CONNOR UNDER THE CHIN… Connor doesn’t flinch. TIME
SUSPENDS the instant before blade meets flesh…</p>
<p><strong>connor’s voice</strong>: The game is not about survival,
Duncan. It’s about living. In the end, it’s all that matters.</p>
<p><strong>the blade cuts clean through connor’s neck with unstoppable
momentum.</strong>: Duncan CRIES OUT as he follows through, BLOOD
staining his blade with the crushing reality of what he has just
committed. He sinks to his knees… . . . and SCREAMS TO THE HEAVENS. The
heavens answer back with THUNDER, LIGHTNING and GALE FORCE WINDS that
seem to come from everywhere at once.</p>
<p><strong>pure essence–</strong>: –HOWLS out of CONNOR’S BODY.</p>
<p><strong>con-norrrrrrr!!</strong>: It SURGES UPWARD into endless
SHEETS of LIGHTNING. Duncan CONVULSES at the epicenter of a GROWING
CLASH between EARTH and SKY. SHOCKWAVES POUND through his skull,
triggering</p>
<p><strong>a last fleeting vision of connor macleod:</strong>: Walking
with Heather across an open field. He turns and looks back at
Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>connor’s eyes</strong>: shine with a look of ultimate peace
and transcendence. He seems to be gazing straight into Duncan’s soul.
And smiling at what he sees as–</p>
<p><strong>a final blast of essence</strong>: RIPS through Duncan’s
BRAIN.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: Duncan stands alone on the rooftop,
stripped to the waist, moving slowly through an elaborate kata. The
precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him. He windmills the
katana over his head, faster and faster, until he suddenly RELEASES
IT–</p>
<p><strong>the sword</strong>: PINWHEELS through the night sky, arcing
out across the open space between buildings… Duncan watches its long,
lofting trajectory… . ..then takes off RUNNING. He reaches the edge of
the rooftop and LEAPS.</p>
<p><strong>wide</strong>: Legs cycling through empty air, he traces a
matching arc directly under the far-flung sword. Like a long-jumper
stretching for that last inch of sand, Duncan HYPER-EXTENDS for the next
rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>his leading foot</strong>: hits the edge– digs in, pivots and
sets.</p>
<p><strong>his hand</strong>: THRUSTS UPWARD as the sword grip SLAPS
INTO HIS OPEN PALM. Fingers wrap around the ivory hilt, slowly lowering
it down to eye-level.</p>
<p><strong>go in close on those eyes</strong>: and see a new Duncan
MacLeod. Stronger. Deadlier. A man cooly aware of his own destiny.</p>
<p><strong>ext - armory - day</strong>: Dawson’s car pulls up to the
generic cinderblock building that now stands unguarded and
abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>int - armory - day</strong>: Dawson enters, squints into the
darkness. The interior looks as if it’s stood fallow for the last three
decades. No giger-chair, no gothic restraints. No evidence the Watchers
ever took up temporary residence here. Except for MATTHEW, who emerges
from the stale halflight to confront Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m a bit surprised to see you again. All
things considered. Dawson just stands there, hands plunged inside his
coat pockets. MATTHEW As you can see, we had to move on. Find a new
Sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: It’s wrong. What you’re doing. It’s
inhuman.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Ah, but they’re not human, really. Are
they?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Gimme a reason, Matthew.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: It’s for the good of us all. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Gimme a reason. Matthew cocks his head like
the RCA dog.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Because we must. It’s that simple. And if
you get in our way again, there will be very serious consequences.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Gimme a good reason. Matthew pulls a gun.
Aims it at Dawson’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m sorry to have to do this, Joe. He pulls
the trigger… as TWO SLUGS pound into his chest. Matthew topples
backward, dead. Dawson palms the gun still concealed in his coat pocket.
Nods.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Reason enough.</p>
<p><strong>ext - new york street - day</strong>: Kase is roaring through
narrow streets in a low-slung convertible, Faith at his side. With utter
disregard for speed or care, he guns it madly in shrieking turns.</p>
<p><strong>int - convertible, driving</strong>: Faith grips the
dashboard two-handed.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Adrenalin’s good for the sex drive.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I’m not amused, Jacob. She reaches over and
slaps on her shoulder harness.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Thought maybe you needed a little more
excitement. You know, spice up our relationship a bit.</p>
<p><strong>wide</strong>: He OVERSTEERS, caroms off several parked cars,
recovers… KASE I mean, isn’t that why you went back to Duncan MacLeod?
The risk?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I don’t know what you’re trying to prove.
Kase puts an arm around her shoulder…</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Why do I have to prove anything to you? …. as
his foot flattens the accelerator. ENGINE WHINES. KASE I can have
anything I want already.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Except me. And that bugs the shit out of you,
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>at the next turn</strong>: it’s clear he’ll never make it,
he’s going too fast. Kase only smiles. Releasing the wheel, he stands in
his seat, lifts his arms above his head and SHOUTS in exultation as–
–the car EXPLODES into the wall. It’s all over in a breath. Accordioned
metal, drooling radiator, and Faith, slumped over the dash. Kase lies
sprawled and battered on the pavement, thrown some distance from the
wreckage. He’s clearly taken the worst of the impact.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the
smoking mangle of steel and plastic. She reaches back and pulls Kase’s
sword free of the wreckage. With single-minded determination, she limps
over to Kase’s body, face-up in his own pooling blood. A disbelieving
PEDESTRIAN pauses in shock. Faith gives her a twisted smile.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Don’t mind us. Pedestrian SCURRIES OFF as
Faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it WHISTLING DOWN across
Kase’s neck. With inhuman reflexes, Kase awakens and catches her wrist
in the same heartbeat. Eyes narrow.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Does this mean it’s over?</p>
<p><strong>ext - kase’s church - day</strong>: Kase steps up to the back
entrance, alone. THE DOOR hangs slightly ajar, which clearly disturbs
him.</p>
<p><strong>int - church sanctuary - day</strong>: Kase enters the main
room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their pews. He kicks the first
pew, awakens both with a start.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Who left the back door open?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Huh? Kase looks to Sarge.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Where’s Cracker Bob? He was supposed to be
watching the back. Calvin and Sarge both shrug. KASE Infants. He whirls,
stalks out.</p>
<p><strong>int - sacristy</strong>: Kase enters his dark, cluttered
office, SLAMMING the door behind him.</p>
<p><strong>flicks on the light</strong>: and stops cold.</p>
<p><strong>a sword</strong>: JUTS from a small wooden table… . . . right
through CRACKER BOB, who lies skewered to the tabletop.</p>
<p><strong>wrapped around the swordhilt</strong>: is Caiolin MacLeod�s
unique silver-and-wood CRUCIFIX. The message is not lost on Kase.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s eyes</strong>: suddenly flutter open. First thing he
sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest.</p>
<p><strong>cracker bob</strong>: Ah– Ahhh– AHHHHHHH!!</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Shut up. He reaches forward and JERKS the
sword out of Bob, and with it</p>
<p><strong>a single scrap of paper</strong>: impaled on the blade. It
bears just one word, scrawled in Bob’s plentiful blood.</p>
<p><strong>glenfinnan</strong>: Bob sits up on the table, wild-eyed, as
Kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>ext - little italy, establishing - night</strong>: Glitter
lights and milling tourists. Row upon row of gimmicky Italian
restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>int - italian restaurant, private room - night</strong>:
Jacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy
backdrop of faux Roman ruins, babbling fountains and plastic holly. It
all imparts a whiff of “Last Supper” pomp to the proceeding. Which is
not lost on the other Immortals, who glance around warily while eating,
as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase. Nor does anyone miss
the fact that there are no windows in this particular room.</p>
<p><strong>close on winston</strong>: He stares into his pasta, beading
sweat.</p>
<p><strong>beneath the table</strong>: his fingers curl around the cold
steel of a .38 SPECIAL wedged between his knees. He inches the gun
upward toward the table rim as… Kase suddenly stands up in the
center.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: A toast… All heads turn. Gun freezes in
Winston’s lap, just hidden from view. KASE I see tonight as a
celebration of the spirit. Here’s to all of you who continue to stand by
me… . . . even those who might waver at times. Winston stiffens, fears
that Kase is on to him. And when Calvin averts his gaze, he knows.
Still, he raises his glass. As do the others. KASE You are my flock. You
nourish my soul. It’s now or never for Winston. His moment of truth.
Kase’s eyes slowly drift over to meet his.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion,</strong>: Kase tips back his glass and drinks,
eyes locked on Winston. Winston responds in kind, gulping down his wine
as he slips the gun back into his pocket. He shoves off from the
table.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Toilet.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Sit sit. I’m not through with my toast
yet.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Can’t wait. He angles for the door.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: I’m almost finished. Sit. Winston reaches for
the doorknob. Locked. He swivels back. Sees death in Jacob Kase’s eyes.
His death. KASE It’ll all be over in a few more seconds. A cold spike of
fear shoots through every single one of them… . . . as Kase continues.
KASE You�ve all been a part of a great quest. A four hundred year quest
for justice. He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword. KASE And here, my
friends, is the instrument of that justice. It’s called the
“Colichmarde.” Finest sword known to man. The blade WHISTLES upright.
KASE Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood. I only break it out for
special occasions. He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of
blade and quillons. KASE It sings like an angel. Just listen. Winston
jerks for his gun. In a SUDDEN BLUR of STEEL and BLOOD, Kase beheads
Winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with
blinding efficiency. TONGUES OF LIQUID ENERGY coil up and around Kase’s
body. But he keeps right on coming. The others scatter like roaches.
ESSENCE PULSES off walls and ceiling, SHATTERING STATUARY, HURLING
FURNITURE… . ..before MERGING with the WALKING INFERNO that is now Jacob
Kase. His sword BLAZES through the remaining victims, trailing STREAKS
OF BLUE FIRE. One after another, they drop headless to the concrete,
triggering</p>
<p><strong>the next wave of essence</strong>: SLAMS into Kase front on.
His knees BUCKLE.</p>
<p><strong>another</strong>: Hits him BROADSIDE, buffeting him one way
as</p>
<p><strong>yet another</strong>: POUNDS him from the opposite- side,
rocking him back center and IMMOBILIZING HIM inside an omni-directional
CRUSH of LIGHT AND SOUND that WHITES OUT THE FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>ext - scottish highlands - day</strong>: A THICK CLINGING
FOG, enshrouds the rocky highlands. Somewhere along the invisible
coastline below, a foghorn MOANS. The skeletal remains of an ancient
Gaelic CASTLE loom spectral gray above</p>
<p><strong>jacob kase</strong>: who stands before an ANCIENT CELTIC
MONOLITH revelling in the changeless land of his birth.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Where else could stir the blood of a Scotsman
too long of this earth and too far from home? Kase picks his way across
the uneven ground, unable to see beyond the reach of his own arm. KASE I
can nae get enough of it. He draws his sword, extends it outward until
the tip disappears from sight. A LOW SCRAPING OF METAL ON STONE taunts
him from somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness Kase’s sword
TWITCHES toward the SOUND. Just the FAINTEST OUTLINE of a FIGURE
COALESCES BRIEFLY inside the fog.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Ah, what’s this? Hamlet’s ghost? The FIGURE
melts back into silent nothingness. KASE I’m afraid even the cloak of
fog won’t help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>a different scraping sound</strong>: spins him around to
see</p>
<p><strong>another ghostly figure</strong>: looming over him from a
narrow stone outcropping. Kase masks a slight tinge of concern. KASE
It’s always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common
cause. But I hope you haven’t sunk to the level of a simultaneous
ambush. Once again, the figure steps backward into the enveloping fog.
Disappears. Slightly unnerved, Kase jerks around. No sign of anyone.
Just that infernal mist. A SOFT SCRAPING of SWORD against ROCK swivels
him back around to his original position.</p>
<p><strong>close on kase</strong>: His nerves are starting to shred. He
turns several full rotations, craning for a glimpse of his tormentors.
And then he sees it…</p>
<p><strong>an apparition wielding a sword.</strong>: Kase LUNGES for it.
And this time, it doesn’t retreat. Swords CLANG in thunderous overture
as</p>
<p><strong>two spectres in the fog</strong>: battle for position on
tenuous footing. KASE drives his adversary backward into a BLUNTED STONE
WALL, leaving him no avenue of escape. Their swords LOCK UP and Kase
suddenly finds himself FACE TO FACE WITH–</p>
<p><strong>duncan macleod.</strong>: You can sense Kase’s bitter
disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Not at all who I’d hoped for.</p>
<p><strong>close on duncan’s eyes</strong>: as they flick to a point
iust behind Kase’s head.</p>
<p><strong>close on kase’s eyes</strong>: as he realizes he’s been had.
He SWINGS FULLY AROUND TO FACE CONNOR– –and sees that NOBODY’S THERE!
Too late– he SWINGS BACK TO DUNCAN– and IMPALES HIMSELF ON DUNCAN’S
SWORD.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m afraid Connor couldn’t be here. But
don’t worry, he’s with us in spirit. Still gripping his sword
two-fisted, Duncan seems to surge with newfound strength.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: He gave himself for this moment. And I
shan’t let him down. Duncan SHOVES OFF from Kase and goes to work on him
with a VENGEANCE.</p>
<p><strong>what kase sees:</strong>: A frightening, hallucinitory vision
of a DUAL ADVERSARY– one that CHANGES back and forth in the flux of
swirling mist. As Duncan’s blade BLURS PAST, Kase sees CONNOR. With the
very next SWING, he sees Duncan again. Then Connor. Then Duncan. Connor.
Duncan… Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand. Shakes it off.
Can’t be. Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling
combinations, then goes inside, tough and ugly. Kase seems suddenly
overwhelmed, physically and mentally, as he’s driven onto his back by
sheer relentless overdrive. Duncan SLASHES DOWN for the killing blow,
which Kase BARELY DEFLECTS. He SLASHES AGAIN. And AGAIN. Each time Kase
barely escapes with his head intact. Duncan keeps up this relentless
barrage, hacking down in every conceivable direction, looking for an
opening, finding none. With each increasingly-leaden DOWNSTROKE, Duncan
is losing strength… . . . and Kase is regaining his. Kase BATTLES BACK
TO HIS FEET, deftly siezes the advantage.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: This is not a game won on points, I’m afraid.
He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of
his superior ability. In a single massive THRUST, Kase STRIPS Duncan’s
sword and sends him flying. Duncan lands on his back, weaponless. Kase
steps up to the katana, scoops his toe under it and FLICKS IT BACK TO
DUNCAN. Then waves him back to his feet. A cat playing with his prey.
Both combatants square off… and RESUME.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: That’s the beauty of eternity. The fun never
stops. He THRUSTS– spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder. Duncan
hangs up on the blade, unable to move. Grimaces in pain. Setting boot to
chest, Kase KICKS Duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling
backward. Duncan reaches out to break his fall– –but there’s no ground
beneath him. He PLUMMETS OFF a SLANTED CLIFF. Bounces at fifty feet,
then tumbles clear to the bottom. Kase steps up to the edge, scowls.</p>
<p><strong>a freshly-cut quarry</strong>: has been hewn from the hilltop
by the massive sword of modern technology. EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT
several stories tall lines the inner basin.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: What have they done to my mountain?! He gazes
down at DUNCAN’S BODY sprawled at the base of the cliff. Then starts
down after him.</p>
<p><strong>ext - bottom of quarry - day</strong>: Duncan crawls over to
his sword… . . . as Kase picks his way down the steep incline. Duncan
spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright. One look
at his battered body and you know this fight is over. He just stands
there, hunched over his sword, grimly waiting for Kase to reach him and
deliver the killing blow. It doesn’t take long. Kase stops, regards him
with contempt.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Don’t make it easy. I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You�re breaking my heart.</p>
<p><strong>kase</strong>: Pick up! Duncan shakes his blood-streaked
head.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It’s always been too easy for you, Kase. No
reason this time should be any different. He plucks his sword out of the
ground… . . . and TURNS HIS BACK TO KASE. DUNCAN Take your best shot. He
hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side. Kase starts TREMBLING WITH
RAGE.</p>
<p><strong>macleod!</strong>: Duncan ignores him, keeps walking. About
now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind. But Kase
doesn’t have a clue.</p>
<p><strong>duncan’s pov:</strong>: For a fleeting moment, Connor stands
before Duncan, more mist than flesh. He opens his arms wide.</p>
<p><strong>connor’s apparition</strong>: Remember weil, old friend. He
DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder… KASE</p>
<p><strong>mac-leod!!</strong>: . ..and CHARGES… Which is exactly what
Duncan expected.</p>
<p><strong>using the same move connor taught him–</strong>: –Duncan
PIVOTS WITH the THRUST, catching Kase completely off guard and off
balance. This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan’s sword
from hitting home. He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE… . ..and
FOLLOWS THROUGH.</p>
<p><strong>on kase:</strong>: He stands there, head miraculously still
intact, a look of bewildered relief. Duncan simply POPS his sword butt
into Kase’s face. The head comes easily away from the neck and falls.
KASE’S POV spins END OVER END through the air, bounces twice and comes
to a rest SIDEWAYS. And that’s how we first see his HEADLESS BODY,
sprawled across the ground.</p>
<p><strong>kase’s severed head</strong>: blinks with sudden recognition.
And now he knows. This is the worst part of losing your head– those last
few seconds of cold lucidity.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: opens his arms to</p>
<p><strong>wide - the quarry</strong>: the ULTIMATE OUICKENING as THE
EARTH</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: EXPLODE like a circle of VOLCANOES venting
into the center. Duncan CLAWS UPWARD on a GROUNDSWELL OF RAW ENERGY as
DIRT, ROCK, ASH and SMOKE OBLITERATE THE BASIN. The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS
GRADUALLY SUBSIDE. The dust settles. And the blighted landscape falls
into an unearthly SILENCE, blind to its own buried secrets. HOLD on the
trailing wisps of smoke as</p>
<p><strong>the ground shudders</strong>: and DUNCAN’S KATANA BREAKS THE
SURFACE. It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE, TWO, THREE MORE TIMES, pulverizing dirt
and stone. HANDS FOLLOW, clawing their up way through the loosely-
mounded earth until DUNCAN’S HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR. As if the earth
itself is giving birth to a new generation of Immortal. He rolls out
onto the ground, gasping, triumphant. Reborn. One inch at a time, he
slowly rises to his feet. As we KEEP ON RISING up into a FIERY HIGHLAND
SUNSET.</p>
<p><strong>ext - highlands above glenfinnan</strong>: Duncan stands over
a freshly-dug grave. Onto the simple stone, he’s chisled:</p>
<p><strong>beloved wife of connor</strong>: And beneath it:</p>
<p><strong>beloved husband of heather</strong>: Duncan’s eyes glisten
with an unspeakable loss. And a comfort in knowing that his friend has
finally found the peace of eternity.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: yours is the greater prize my friend.
Welcome home. LINGER ON DUNCAN as we DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO…</p>
<p><strong>ext - manhattan skyline - dawn</strong>: FAITH stands
sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River and the
insignificant island of Manhattan beyond. Her trademark slashes of
facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin. What remains is
a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity. Her faraway eyes BLINK
with a sudden, frightening clarity. THE BUZZ sets her reflexes snapping
as she SPINS AROUND– –and CATCHES the COLICHMARDE, handle first.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: follows, strolling toward her with hands
loose at his side. Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: So… what am I supposed to do next – kiss you
or take your head? Duncan steps up to her, smiling enigmatically.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: The choice is yours.</p>
