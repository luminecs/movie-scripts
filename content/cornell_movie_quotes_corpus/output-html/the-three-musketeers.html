<h1 id="the-three-musketeers">the-three-musketeers</h1>
<p><strong>superimpose</strong>: France, 1625. Suddenly, two young men
burst INTO VIEW, sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning
air. The first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet.
The second, D’ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance and attitude. Exuberant,
handsome. And at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a
boisterous cry.</p>
<p><strong>4 back to scene 4</strong>: Girard leaps to the ground first
– landing in an en- closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D’Artagnan
flies after. The geese scatter, d’Artagnan – whose wild progress
frequently resembles that of a young colt – stumbles briefly. Girard
seeks advantage, thrusts his sword toward the young man’s heart. But
d’Artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the
offending goose – glances deadpan apology – and rises to fight again.
The epic battle continues. Girard’s modest success de- volves into
desperate flight. D’Artagnan’s seemingly endless reserves are wearing
him down. Then, at the last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a
slow- moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs toward the
cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d’Artagnan with a confident smirk –
an expression that vanishes when the young Gascon executes a nearly
impossible leap to join him. And still they battle, the clash of swords
a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn- ing
all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just then: The haycart
crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard backs from d’Artagnan’s sword,
weak from exhaustion, he stumbles. D’Artagnan has his man and he knows
it. He prepares one last blow – – And the haycart shifts, deposits both
men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical
antidote to all this glorious swordplay.</p>
<p><strong>5 include creek 5</strong>: Girard lands flat on his back,
stunned, his sword out of reach. D’Artagnan lands similarly, but
recovers with grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation
will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and lightly places
the sharp gleaming tip against his adam’s apple.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Had enough?</p>
<p><strong>girard</strong>: I believe now would be a good time to end
your, uhm, formal training. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>girard</strong>: And god have mercy on whomever you meet
next.</p>
<p><strong>7 another angle 7</strong>: She stands at the open window,
watches his coltish high steps with love. Sadness too.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Mother…?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Did you see us? You heard us, I’ll bet.
Girard finally surrendered a compliment… though I almost had to kill him
to get it… Mother…?</p>
<p><strong>9 continued: 9</strong>: A piece of parchment, on it the
words: “All For One, and One For All.” And, in a place of honor, a worn
blue and gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d’Artagnan’s mother,
kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Didn’t you hear me? Girard –</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your father was a proud man. And he had a
right to be. I never knew one as brave or as kind. He knew that his
strength was a gift to be given in the service of honor. That is why he
dedicated his life to his country and his King. That is why he gave his
life, for both.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I watched you this morning and saw someone I
knew. You have your father’s heart, his will to fight, his courage. But
these gifts have no value unless they are given.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s time for you find your fortune with men
as brave and as bold as you are. In Paris. With the King’s Musketeers.
You’ll need this.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Father’s sword.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Forged in the Crusades, handed from
generation to generation.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: And now to me.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes, son. And now to you.</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. gascony - day 10</strong>: A huge and beautiful field
appropriate to the moment. Mother and son stand in the vast expanse.
D’Artagnan holds a restless horse by the reins, his traveling satch- el
attached to the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m not your mother now. I’m speaking for
your father. And this is what he would have told you. Never forget the
code of the d’Artagnans. It is your special heritage. Always seek out
adventure…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Never run from a fight…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Never submit to insults. Except from the
King.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And be wary of Cardinal Richelieu for he
rules France through the King.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Mother. Maybe I should wait. Until after
harvest.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’ve heard that every man in the
Musketeers is on the run from someone or something?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes. But what am I running from?</p>
<p><strong>mogher</strong>: A shrew of a mother, and a drafty old house.
Now go.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And for heaven’s sake, practice your
horsemanship.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Horsemanship. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>12 emblem of king’s musketeers 12</strong>: It FILLS the
SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT
APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS, the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It
slides beneath the emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to
the floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge hearth
behind it.</p>
<p><strong>13 include musketeers’ headquarters 13</strong>: A room in
the Musketeers Headquarters. The fallen emblem is retrieved by JUSSAC,
an officer who wears the bright red tunic of the Cardinal’s Guards.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: What should I do with this?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Throw it on the fire with everything
else.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: But this is the emblem of the
Musketeers…</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: The Musketeers no longer exist. Or
haven’t you heard? Throw it on the fire.</p>
<p><strong>14 include courtyard 14</strong>: Grim, funereal silence as a
hundred Musketeers remove their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a
pile that already contains their swords and muskets. The Musketeers
remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal the depth of their despair.
The latter is supervised by the Cardinal’s Guards, who view their hated
enemies’ plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the Musketeers,
the end of an era.</p>
<p><strong>14 continued: 14</strong>: Treville is the respected leader
of the Musketeers. This is the saddest moment of all.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Musketeers…</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: By joint edict of His Majesty King Louis
XIII and His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu, the Musketeers are officially
disbanded. In preparation for the coming war with England, your ranks
and commissions are hereby transferred to the Infantry. You will be
contacted and told where to report. Until that time, you are instructed
to return to your homes.</p>
<p><strong>de treville</strong>: And who will protect the King?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: The Cardinal’s Guards are more than
capable of assuming that… responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: You are hereby ordered to disperse.
Should even one of you resist… the entire corps will be arrested and
imprisoned. ‘All for one, and one for all.’</p>
<p><strong>de treville</strong>: Musketeers!</p>
<p><strong>de treville</strong>: Go to your homes. Wait. Our day will
come again.</p>
<p><strong>15 rochefort 15</strong>: He returns to the adjoining room
where Jussac stands by. Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes
to a mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak- ish
angle. That’s when he catches a glimpse of something behind him.
Something red. Rochefort turns. a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in
the shadows of the room, a spectre in red.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Your Eminence.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Have they all been accounted for?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: All but… three.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Three?</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: I sent a patrol to find them but it hasn’t
returned yet.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I want those Musketeers, not excuses.
Bring them in at once.</p>
<p><strong>16 ext. boulevard of crime - day 16</strong>: Jussac leads a
regiment of the Cardinal’s Gruards down Paris’ most colorful and
notorious street. They react to SHOUTING and VIOLENT NOISES coming from
a tavern ahead. The one called… The Dead Rat. The tavern door flies
open, and two of the Cardinal’s Guards are flung into the street,
bruised and bloody. Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,
and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his feet, threatening
to drop him into the street. The Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites
– wine, women, song – is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: Release that man!!</p>
<p><strong>17 continued: 17</strong>: One of them casually cleans his
sword with a lace hand- kerchief. He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and
dashing of the Musketeers – a poet and idealist – a gentleman of great
personal charm and style. His companion is ATHOS, the Musketeers’
deadliest and most charismatic member – also its most mysterious and
tortured. Athos is the unofficial leader of the Three Musketeers, their
planner and strategist. At the moment, he’s sewing up a nasty gash on
his right arm.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: A private party. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Athos – is that any way to greet our
guests?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Don’t be shy, gentlemen. Come in. Your
friends have been expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: Your presence is requested at Musketeer
Headquarters by Captain Rochefort.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: The Cyclops is a Captain? He must’ve made a
pact with the Devil.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Or the Cardinal.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: The Devil is more ethical than the
Cardinal.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: You’re instructed to come with me and
surrender your tunics.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: These gentlemen made a similar request.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: Are you refusing to come peaceably?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Probably. But I’ll leave it up to my
companions. Aramis?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: We can’t refuse Rochefort’s invitation. It
would be impolite.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: And what do you say, Porthos?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I’ll be right down!</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Congratulations, Porthos. You brought down
the house.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: My aim was off. I was trying to hit
Jussac.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Now. About those tunics…</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. high road to paris - day 18</strong>: D’Artagnan, on
horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook- ing the magnificent city on the
Seine. What he beholds is Paris as it looked in the early part of the
Seven- teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky.
For a country boy like d’Artagnan, Paris is a magical place where the
wildest of dreams can come true. D’Artagnan’s reverie is broken by the
sound of THUNDERING HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response
and what he sees is this: Two women on horseback are riding for all
they’re worth pursued by two men on horseback.</p>
<p><strong>20 angle 20</strong>: As the two riders pass underneath,
d’Artagnan leaps into space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of
the saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense- less. One
down. D’Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re- verses
direction and GALLOPS back, charging d’Artagnan. The rider draws his
saber. D’Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches the second
rider’s arm and yanks him right out of the saddle. The man lands with a
painful thud at d’Artagnan’s feet. Before he can recover, d’Artagnan is
upon him with flying fists. One swift punch – and the second rider is
senseless. Two down.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Do you have any idea what you’ve
done?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’ve saved you and your friend from
these bandits.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: These ‘bandits’ are the Queen’s own
bodyguards.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The Queen?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: If I were you, I’d make myself scarce.
These men are going to be very angry when they wake up.</p>
<p><strong>20 continued: 20</strong>: D’Artagnan looks at the two
bodyguards who are beginning to recover. Then he looks up at Constance,
feeling like a prize idiot.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I didn’t know. I thought…</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: D’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: You’re a very foolish boy, d’Artagnan…
but a very handsome one. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Wait! You didn’t tell me your name!</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The man who attacked you… … went that
way.</p>
<p><strong>22 d’artagnan’s pov 22</strong>: Paris laid out for him like
a jewel, cloaked in mystery, promising adventure and romance. D’Artagnan
watches the women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance. He
follows.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. musketeer headquarters - day 23</strong>: Athos,
Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted courtyard. Silence – the
last thing they expected – stops them in their tracks. The place is a
cemetery, haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers. Porthos is
visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from behind an archway.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I’ll take those tunics, Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: He said he’ll take those tunics.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Tunics? Coming right up.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I was trying to remember the last time I saw
you here. I know. It was the day you were kicked out of the
Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer. Wasn’t that
the charge?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: You ought to know. Three witnesses stood
against me.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: It was the least we could do.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: You are hereby ordered to surrender your
commissions and make yourselves available for reassignment in the King’s
Army.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: And if we refuse?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: You will become outlaws. Hunted men.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: It doesn’t matter where I go or what I do.
Sooner or later somebody’s calling me ‘outlaw.’</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Are you refusing to serve your King?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: We are refusing to serve the Cardinal.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Same thing, these days.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: France has one King too many.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I’ll tell him you said that.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Do that, Rochefort. Tell his Emminence the
Cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the
King. From enemies across the sea.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: From traitors who sit at his right hand. And
tell him that he can take away our tunics, our muskets, even our swords.
But he cannot stop us from being what we are. Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I’ll make sure His Emminence the Cardinal
gets the message. But I can’t promise he’ll be pleased.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Well, if we’re going to be outlaws, I
suppose we’ll have to get our affairs in order.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Are you going to visit them alphabetically
or in order of preference?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Alphabetically seems… fair.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: When it comes to you and women, fairness
rarely applies.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: We’ll meet at the Columbier-Rouge at sundown.
To celebrate. And to plan our new lives.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Outlaws.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Citizens of France.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: The three Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>23 continued: 23</strong>: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step in
different directions.</p>
<p><strong>25 athos 25</strong>: He crosses the courtyard to a large
wooden door. But as he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and
smacks him in his injured arm.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Aaarrgghh…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Where are they? Where are the
Musketeers? I’m in the right place, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Not as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But this is Musketeer Headquarters…</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: No. This was Musketeer Headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You mean it’s been moved?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I mean the Musketeers have been disbanded.
Feel free to poke around for souvenirs.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What do you mean ‘disbanded’?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Some nonsense about being needed in the army.
Now if you’ll excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But I just got here. How can I become a
Musketeer if they’ve been disbanded?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I’d say you’ve got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: You could use a lesson in manners.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I’m in a hurry now – but I’ll meet you at the
Carmes-Deshaux monastery at noon.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’ll be there ten minutes early.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: An hour in Paris, and I already have my
first duel!</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: But, Catherine, don’t you see? As an outlaw
I’ll be constantly on the run from the Cardinal’s guards, a refugee.
Think of all the places you can hide me. I’m thinking of them now.</p>
<p><strong>28 angle on d’artagnan 28</strong>: Meanwhile, d’Artagnan
races around another corner, down a narrow lane, and speeds after the
ladies on horseback. He dashes through a muddy puddle – spraying foul
water all over Porthos where he stands. D’Artagnan doesn’t notice, a
huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled INTO VIEW, blocking the
lane. Fellow travelers shout complaints, the cart driver shakes his
head, makes an obscene gesture. It’s a Seventeenth Century traffic
jam.</p>
<p><strong>28 continued: 28</strong>: D’Artagnan looks up – literally,
given Porthos’ impres- sive stature – and sees the Musketeer’s muddied
tunic, and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly
soiled.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Do you know where this sash comes from?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: It is a gift from the Queen of America.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: There is no Queen of America.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Madame Augustine, would you excuse me for a
moment, I’m going to kill him. Now, where were we?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I rode through a puddle, muddied your
sash, the Queen of America except there isn’t one, I’m in a hurry, and
you were about to challenge me to a duel.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I was?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: That seems to be the local custom.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Everywhere I go, it’s always the same.
There’s always some kid who thinks he’s hot with a sword… some itchy
punk who wants to go up against the great Porthos…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The great who?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: The great Porthos. Me, you idiot.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Don’t you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The world’s greatest talker?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: All right, you little puke! You want to
die? So be it! One o’clock behind the Luxembourg! And bring a
coffin!</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Bring your own!</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. streets of paris - alley - day 29</strong>:
D’Artagnan thinks he sees Anne and Constance, races down the alley,
turns a corner, down a short street, makes a hasty decision, runs down
yet another alley… and tum- bles into a shadowy lane. He stops, looks
left and right. And does see them.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Let me pass.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal’s guard</strong>: I’m afraid that’s not
possible.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I must speak to those young women.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal’s guard</strong>: The young women do not wish to be
spoken to.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I have something that belongs to the
Queen.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: A bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’ll deliver it for you.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: No, you’ve been enough help already.
Would you be so kind as to point out the Carmes-Deshaux Monastery?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Madam, I’m flattered but I thought you
wanted me to tutor you in theology.</p>
<p><strong>damsel</strong>: Excuse me, Monsieur Aramis. But when you
started talking about Original Sin, I lost control and became
impassioned. It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: There’s nothing unholy about expressing
one’s emotions. On the contrary. Religion should be experienced in a
passionate, all- embracing way. We should feel free to express our
spirituality.</p>
<p><strong>damsel</strong>: Yes, darling!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p><strong>damsel</strong>: My husband!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Your husband!?</p>
<p><strong>damsel</strong>: Aramis – run!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: First we must pray to God for
forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: On second thought, God’s often busy.</p>
<p><strong>31 street below 31</strong>: As d’Artagnan runs past. Aramis
lands on top of him and they go crashing to the cobblestones. As they
untangle themselves and get up…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Thanks. You broke my fall perfectly. But I
do apologize for the inconvenience…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: If there’s one thing I can’t abide, it’s
rudeness.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You fell on me!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: And I apologized for it.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I suppose you’d like to teach me a
lesson in manners, too.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I’d be honored.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: How’s two o’clock behind the
Luxembourg?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: If that’s where you wish to die, I won’t
disappoint you. Until then…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Three duels in one day. I love this
town.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. louvre - day 32</strong>: The Royal Palace of Louis
XIII.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Have you seen the King?</p>
<p><strong>seneschal</strong>: No, Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Your Majesty…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: How was your ride?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: My ride…? Well, I… I’m not sure…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: But your welfare is more than a matter of
personal interest. It is a matter of State. But rest assured, your
secret is safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: You’re homesick.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Lonely. Is that the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Austria’s loss is France’s gain.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m not sure my new husband shares your
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Nonsense. He’s young, not blind.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mostly, he is absent. I’ve barely seen His
Majesty since our wedding, and that was three months ago. Whenever he’s
around me, he has nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Arranged marriages can be difficult. Your
father and I thought yours would bring Austria and France closer
together.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Countries align more swiftly than people, I’m
afraid. Louis and I remain… far apart.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: May I advise you?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Louis was only nine years old when his
father was assassinated. He lost his childhood forever that day. I have
watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands. A boy
who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man.
He is shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet stubborn. But most of all, he is
not yet sure exactly who he is. The boy who lost his father. Or the King
of France.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But how can I…?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Flatter him. Make the boy feel like a
King. So that the King may be your husband.</p>
<p><strong>seneschal</strong>: His Majesty, the King.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Cardinal Richelieu, I’ve been looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>33 continued: 33</strong>: When Louis sees Anne, he reacts
with an almost imper- ceptible start. Her presence catches him off
guard.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn’t know you were
here.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Would you like me to go?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No. Please, stay. Your Eminence, I demand an
answer.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Perhaps if I knew the question…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ve just been told that you went ahead and
disbanded my Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: You approved the decision.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But not the timing of the matter. I intended
to address them myself, explain the situation…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your Majesty, France is on the brink of
war. We dare not hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But these men are my personal guards…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: They are the bravest fighters in
France.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: We’ll need them in the field if we’re to
win this war with England. Buckingham plans to invade La Rochelle within
the month. I thought it best to act quickly –</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I will be the judge of what is best. For me,
and for France.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Of course. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Anne? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You two should continue this discussion in
private.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: reason for her to</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It seems to me that… you’re doing very well on
your own.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Extremely.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Sometimes she scares me half to death.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: May I advise you?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: She scares me too. As do all women who
join beauty to intelligence. What’s a man to do?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: The course of love is full of frightful
turns. But, no matter how you feel, no matter how hopelessly afraid…
never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most
confident man in France. Make that your starting point, and everything
else will fall… into place.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The bravest man in France…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Good advice for a shopkeeper. Let alone a
King.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Your Eminence, I’m sorry that I was sharp
with you. It’s just that the Musketeers… well, they’re not just my
guards. They’re my friends too.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I know. But don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: From now on, I’ll take complete
responsibility for your welfare.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: He’s a foolish boy. And barely that.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: That foolish boy is about to become a
man. Which is all the more reason for us to act… quickly.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: And the Queen…?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: She will receive me in ways she never
thought possible. Privately.</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. streets of paris - day 35</strong>: D’Artagnan walks
proudly toward the Carmes-Deschaux monastery, bold and brave, his future
at hand. Suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>coach driver</strong>: Get out of the way, idiot!!</p>
<p><strong>35 continued: 35</strong>: She is a noblewoman of remarkable
beauty, her face framed by the carriage window. Long blonde curly hair
that cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes, and skin
as white as alabaster. She is known as MILADY DE WINTER. She is to sex,
what Constance is to innocence.</p>
<p><strong>36 ext. streets of paris - seine - pov shot - day
36</strong>: A beautiful house situated near the Seine. Milady’s
carriage stops before it. She steps to the street, Parker follows. After
a brief spoken exchange, the body- guard departs on some errand. HENRI,
the driver, a brutal- looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant
coachman’s uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away.
Milady steps inside.</p>
<p><strong>37 another angle - pov 37</strong>: REVEALS this to have been
the POV of two men standing in the shadows across the street. COUNT DE
WINTER, forty- five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE
WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But their manner
and appearance suggests that they have traveled a long distance to find
her.</p>
<p><strong>count de winter</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: But, Father…</p>
<p><strong>count de winter</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. milady’s house - day 38</strong>: Milady stands
before a mirror, reaches for one of the many ivory combs that adorn her
hair. As she places the comb we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her
arm. She pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of Count de
Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark and cold. Milady does not
move from the reflecting glass, she smiles.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Count de Winter.</p>
<p><strong>count de winter</strong>: We found you.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Yes. Now that you have, what will you
do?</p>
<p><strong>count de winter</strong>: Bring you back. To pay for what you
did to my son.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: And if I resist…?</p>
<p><strong>count de winter</strong>: I will kill you with my bare
hands.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Well if that’s the case, I’d better start
packing. But first, my hair…</p>
<p><strong>40 int. milady’s house - day 40</strong>: Armand climbs a
flight of stairs. Still no sign of his father, or Milady. He calls
out:</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. carmes-deschaux monastery - day 41</strong>: The
monastery is a windowless building bordered by a barren field, a dueling
ground for men who have little time to waste. Athos sits on a stone
bench, waits for his adversary to arrive. His horse is hobbled nearby.
D’Artagnan rides INTO VIEW, dismounts.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Ten minutes early.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I have another appointment at one.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: You’ll miss it, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’ll try my best to be on time.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I asked two of my friends to act as seconds,
but they are not as punctual.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But you’re wounded.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Don’t worry. I fight just as well with my
left hand.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: If you’d rather kill me another
time…</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Thanks, but I see my seconds coming now.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: What’re you doing? You can’t fight this
man.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Because I’m fighting him.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Excuse me, monsieur. But not until one
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ve got a duel with him,
too.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes, sir. But not until two.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: How long have you been in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I arrived this morning.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: You’ve been… busy.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’ve also fallen in love.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Better to die for love than to live for it.
Gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>41 continued: 41</strong>: Athos gestures for Aramis and
Porthos to stand aside. He draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And
in that moment, d’Artagnan’s face reveals an emotion he has never felt
before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it, allows him a moment to
withdraw his saber. D’Artagnan does so, they square off, touch sabers,
and…</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: There they are!!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Jussac. Again.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I told you the next time we met I’d want an
answer. But I didn’t expect you so soon.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: The three of you are under arrest. The boy’s
of no interest to me and is free to go. Do you intend to resist?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Oh, don’t be stupid. Of course we intend to
resist. Just give us a second.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Interesting odds. Five of them and three of
us.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: It hardly seems fair. Let’s give them the
chance to surrender.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Excuse me, but there are four of us.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: This is not your fight. You’re not a
Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I may not wear the uniform, but I
believe I have the heart of a Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Bold and brave.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: A poet.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Have you got a name, boy?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: D’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: D’Artagnan?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: It couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Athos… Porthos… Aramis.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Pleased to meet you… How do you do?…
Good to see you again…</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Well. Now that we’re all acquainted…</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: The Cardinal’s Guards.</p>
<p><strong>42 fight 42</strong>: Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal
combat. Athos takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT, and
Aramis battles with two adversaries at once. D’Artagnan looks for an
opponent… and finds himself face to face with Jussac. The fighting style
of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix- ture of styles and techniques.
Athos is a brutal swords- man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His
repertoire also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional
elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful technician, he
handles his two opponents with balletic ease, an artist working with
steel and flesh, rather than paint and canvas. And last, and perhaps the
most entertaining of all, Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a
variety of bizarre weapons on his body – a crossbow, daggers, bolo,
nunchucks – all of which he uses with the polished skill of a master.
Add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and
strength, and you have a one- man wrecking crew of epic proportions.
D’Artagnan’s youthful energy is by now familiar. He bounds about like a
newborn tiger, encircles his adver- sary, changing stance and shifting
his ground with alac- rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending
himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
directions at once.</p>
<p><strong>jussac</strong>: Stand still! How do you expect me to kill
you if you keep jumping around!!</p>
<p><strong>44 back to scene 44</strong>: Porthos reacts to the
interruption with irritation. He produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat
looks at the odd weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion…
and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks him to the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Damn monks. Always spoiling everybody’s
fun.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: They are nearer to God…</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: They’re about to get a little nearer to the
hilt of my sword.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Pagan.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Papist.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I’m fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Take a look at our young friend.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: You mean he’s still alive?</p>
<p><strong>44 continued: 44</strong>: Jussac falls to the ground, lies
still. He is dead.</p>
<p><strong>biscarat</strong>: Now what…?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: God, I love my work.</p>
<p><strong>45 aftermath 45</strong>: A sudden silence, save for the
occasional dull groan. D’Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis
bending over Jussac’s body, speaking in solemn tones under his
breath.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Last rites. Aramis takes death very
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Do you know where this bolo comes from?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The Queen of America?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Spain.</p>
<p><strong>45 continued: 45</strong>: Porthos deadpans, then grins
acceptance. All for one, and one for all. D’Artagnan beams.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Don’t encourage him. By killing Jussac, the
boy’s made himself an outlaw too.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Not if he leaves Paris. Which is exactly what
he’s going to do.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I can’t leave. I just got here.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Go home, find a wench, live long and
prosper.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Why can’t I stay with you?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Because I do not want you to.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly,
but don’t let that fool you.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: He really is cold and unfriendly.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: But he’s also right. This is our fight, not
yours. Go on, get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Whatever happened to the motto of the
Musketeers? ‘All for one, and one for all.’</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Wake up, boy. The Musketeers are just a
dream.</p>
<p><strong>45 continued: 45</strong>: Athos spurs his horse, rides away.
Aramis and Porthos follow. HOLD ON d’Artagnan as he watches the
Musketeers grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his
horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best and the worst
day of his young life.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: There they go! After them!</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Long live the Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>at distance</strong>: The three Muskeeters rein their horses,
look back to d’Artagnan’s bold charge.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Do you believe this kid.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Fall back! I’ll take him myself!</p>
<p><strong>46 angle to include muskeers 46</strong>: Porthos and Aramis
are greatly moved by d’Artagnan’s courage.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Rochefort’s got the boy.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: You can’t just leave him.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: He has a plan.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Definitely. A plan.</p>
<p><strong>47 back to scene 47</strong>: Meanwhile, d’Artagnan is soon
outnumbered, and quickly subdued.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: This boy fights like a wildcat.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>48 continued: 48</strong>: Lovingly, he fingers the
upholstery of his extravagant carriage.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: My sword –</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: It’s magnificent. Where did you get
it?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: It belonged to my father.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Your father…</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Well now it belongs to me. I collect
swords. I take them from the men I kill.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’m not dead yet.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I’ll give you a hint. It’s not the
Louvre.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The Bastille! I’m in the Bastille!</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Well, you’re the first person who was
ever happy to be here. Unfortunately, your visit will be a short
one.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: You killed one of the Cardinal’s Guards.
An offense punishable by death.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: He interrupted a duel I was
fighting.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Also punishable by death.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: It was a long day.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: You know them?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: The Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Tell me where they are, and I will be
lenient.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I will give you your father’s sword.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Give me my father’s sword, and I’ll cut
out your heart.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Fool. Like your father.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. bastille - corridor - night 50</strong>: The jailer
exits from d’Artagnan’s cell, closes the heavy door behind him. A CLOSER
look reveals d’Artagnan in the jailer’s soiled tunic, eyes bright with
adventure. He looks left and right – dank corridors, darkness, the
OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>52 int. bastille - night 52</strong>: D’Artagnan keeps step
with the cloaked figure, the ret- inue. He keeps his head down, glances
at the corridor ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is
escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and toward a pristine
wooden door. D’Artagnan watches as the door opens, revealing… Cardinal
Richelieu, a fear- some apparition in red, the most powerful man in
France.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I have an errand that requires your
singular talents.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I was beginning to think you’d forgotten
me.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Forget you? Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>55 back to scene 55</strong>: Richelieu produces a sealed
document from his sleeve, and hands it to Milady.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Carry this to the Duke of Buckingham.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: You did it. An alliance with Buckingham.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: The King left me no choice. Now that he’s
come of age, the boy believes he should rule France. Instead of me.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: You’re going to go through with …
everything?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Yes. Everything. You’re to leave for
Calais at once. A ship called the Persephone will carry you to England.
It sails Tuesday, midnight. I want Buckingham’s signature next to mine
before the King’s birthday. Friday.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Consider it done.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: And doing so, shall earn you the
gratitude of… a King.</p>
<p><strong>57 ext. bastille - milady’s coach 57</strong>: Exiting.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: On your knees.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: This is the boy who killed Jussac.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I can explain that –</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Silence!</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Rochefort. Violence solves nothing. Leave
him to me.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Please. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: How much did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Not a word, Your Eminence. I stepped
from my cell for a breath of air, and became lost in the corridors, it’s
dark as you know, but then I saw a light up ahead, the light over your
door, I…</p>
<p><strong>58 continued: 58</strong>: Richelieu smiles, dismisses
d’Artagnan’s tale with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: You may have many talents, my young
friend. But guile is not one of them. Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: D’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I’ve heard that name before. Are you a
Gascon?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes, Your Eminence.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Tell me. What brought you to Paris. And
don’t say ‘a horse.’</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I came to join the King’s
Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Bad timing.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: So I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: D’Artagnan, I like you. I could use a
capable young man like you in my Guards.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’m honored, Your Eminence, but I don’t
think I would be very popular with the other men. Not after today.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I suppose not. Your heart is set on being
a Musketeer. When I was your age, I too had dreams of joining the
Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You, Your Eminence?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is the
fantasy of every young Frenchman. Or should I say it was… Like the
Knights of the Round Table, the Musketeers have outlived their
usefulness. They are a thing of the past. And so have your three
friends. Tell me where they are, d’Artagnan, and I will spare your
life.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’m sorry. But I can’t tell you what I
do not know.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: In that case, give my regards to the
headsman.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What about my trial?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: You’ve just had it.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Wait –</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Why? Do you object to losing your
head?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes. I like it where it is.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Then tell me what I want to know, and
perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer. Where are the three
Musketeers?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: And if you did?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I wouldn’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I admire your courage, young man. You
might have made a fine Musketeer after all.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: But we’ll never know, will we?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Find the three Musketeers and kill
them.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: They’ll be dead by dawn.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: A comforting thought. Good night,
d’Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning comes quickly.</p>
<p><strong>59 continued: 59</strong>: The crowd roars approval. And
turns to regard the day’s victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Milady left at midnight. By private
coach.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: A remarkable woman. The most beautiful
I’ve ever known. And the deadliest. Which would explain my attraction.
How is our young daredevil holding up?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: He’s wishing he’d never heard of the
Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Fear not, my son…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: For we are with you, always.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: All for one, and one for all…</p>
<p><strong>captain of the guards</strong>: Prepare the prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Don’t worry, boy. You won’t feel a
thing.</p>
<p><strong>captain of the guards</strong>: Where is Father Rostand
today?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: The good father is… all tied up.</p>
<p><strong>captain of the guards</strong>: Very well. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>63 another angle 63</strong>: Meanwhile, on the perimeter of
the square, two figures ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. A
CLOSER look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through the
city, towards the countryside beyond. But their progress has led them
here. Anne frowns at the spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Barbarism.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Men call it justice.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Are you surprised?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>64 market square 64</strong>: The Cardinal’s crimson carriage
races toward the scaffold, scattering the crowd in all directions. Men
shout, women scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion’s sharp hooves,
the coach’s THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver’s seat, clutching
the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP in the other… is Athos.
Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the closest
men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out a PISTOL, and BLASTS the
saber from the hand of the Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises
his musket to shoot the false priest, but d’Artagnan leaps out of
nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man- at-arms off the
scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: expression, but a</p>
<p><strong>65 continued: 65</strong>: D’Artagnan rushes to the edge of
the scaffold, springs into the air, landing on the seat beside him.
Aramis and Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the
carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the plush interior
below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP… and the stallions race off through the
crowd, towards freedom.</p>
<p><strong>66 square 66</strong>: Constance watches the escape,
transfixed, delighted. As the carriage barrels from the scaffold, she
thrusts a gloved fist into the air, triumphant.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>67 tower 67</strong>: But the Cardinal looks on with
horror.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: My carriage.</p>
<p><strong>68 carriage 68</strong>: Athos produces a dagger, cuts the
leather ties that bind d’Artagnan’s wrists.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Well, what have we here?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: How considerate of the Cardinal to provide
us with a snack.</p>
<p><strong>69 continued: 69</strong>: Porthos extracts a bottle of wine,
grabs a turkey leg. Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small
ornate box.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: How is it that a man of God becomes a man of
gold?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Trinkets for the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Let’s share.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Would you be so good as to distribute these?
Your generosity will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But…?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Throw the coins, boy. The people are
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: They’re firing at us!</p>
<p><strong>70 continued: 70</strong>: Porthos sticks his head INTO VIEW,
offers them a bubbling bottle of champagne, the source of the popping
sound.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Champagne?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: You know I prefer wine.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Don’t go away.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: May I recommend this find Cabernet?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Turn right at the next street.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The next right…?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Turn.</p>
<p><strong>71 include interior 71</strong>: Porthos looks up from his
chest, champagne spilled all over his tunic… and a brand new sash.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: That’s it. Next time, you drive.</p>
<p><strong>72 continued: 72</strong>: D’Artagnan sighs with relief.
Athos yanks the brake lever, brings the horses to a halt, and leaps down
from the driver’s seat. D’Artagnan follows. Athos pulls the passenger
door open, revealing Porthos and Aramis inside. Gold coins on the carpet
at their feet, food and drink between them.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Gentlemen, this is the end of the line. I
hope you had a pleasant ride. Unhitch the horses.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But the Guards.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Your pistol and powder, please.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>73 bottom of hill 73</strong>: D’Artagnan and the three
Musketeers mount the Cardinal’s white stallions, race off into the
distance. Porthos shouts, laughing.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I’d give five years of your life just to
see the Cardinal’s face!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Ten!</p>
<p><strong>74 richelieu’s face 74</strong>: The Cardinal’s face is
contorted in fury. He steps out of a horse cart, approaches the charred
remains of his be- loved carriage. He stares at the smouldering ruin for
a long beat. Rochefort and a company of Guards stand near- by, wait for
him to speak. When he does, his tone is measured and calm.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: One thousand pistoles on each of their
heads, dead or alive. The boy knows our plans.</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. woods - day 75</strong>: D’Artagnan and the three
Musketeers rest against tree trunks in a hidden glade, polish off the
last of the Cardinal’s food and drink. Their usual cynicism replaced by
something approaching camaraderie. Aramis smiles as d’Artagnan attacks a
turkey wing.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I haven’t eaten in three days. I guess
with all the excitement, I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Your trip from home has been an eventful
one.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Three days.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I heard of a d’Artagnan once. He was a
captain in the Musketeers when we were just recruits.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: He was my father.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: A good man, I’m told.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I knew there was something familiar about
this boy.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: He died when I was nine.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: All my mother would tell me is that he
died in the service of the King.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: D’Artagnan, your father and another Musketeer
were ambushed and murdered outside the Louvre.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: This other Musketeer – is he still
alive? I’d like to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: You already have. His name is the Count De
Rochefort.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: D’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I imagined his death a hundred time.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: On a battlefield, defending his King.
Fighting bravely for France. And now… I will find the man who murdered
my father and kill him where he stands.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: A man is better measured by his life than by
his death. Your father was bold, and brave.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But you never knew him…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: He lives in you.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: And your father?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I was orphaned at a young age. The church
took me in.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You didn’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: But I did. He was a great man, a leader of
the church. And his example inspired me to dedicate my life to God’s
service.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You were a priest…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I was a fool. This great man, this father,
betrayed the church, and turned his back on God. To worship power and
gold.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: It broke my heart to see it.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: And you became a Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I joined the Musketeers and a strange thing
happened. I got my faith back.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But who was that man…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: All of France knows him. His Eminence, the
Cardinal Richelieu.</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. roof of palais cardinal - day 77</strong>: Richelieu
stands on the roof of the Palais, lost in thought. He looks down and
sees, through the smoke and mist, the silent rooftops of Paris, pointed,
innumerable. Richelieu turns, and crosses to an elaborate pigeon coop.
Servants attach messages to the legs of carrier pigeons. Rochefort steps
INTO VIEW, anxious, out of breath.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Your Eminence. The Musketeers have been
sighted riding north on the road to Calais.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Don’t worry. Thanks to our winged
friends, every mercenary and bounty hunter in France will be waiting for
them. Isn’t modern communication a wonderful thing?</p>
<p><strong>77 continued: 77</strong>: Richelieu releases the bird, and
watches it streak sky- ward, flying across the sky.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: … I couldn’t hear it clearly, I was
standing by the door, the voices were low –</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The Cardinal sent someone to England.
With a secret treaty.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: He’s made an alliance with a man named,
Bucking… Buckingham.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: The Duke of Buckingham?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: He rules England the way Richelieu rules
France. A ship called the Persephone waits for the Cardinal’s agent at
Calais. To take him to England. Tuesday, midnight.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Calais is over two hundred leagues from
here…</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: This messenger and the treaty will prove
the Cardinal a traitor. If we can get our hands on them.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What are we waiting for, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Does the Cardinal know you have this
information?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Then he knows we have it too. And he’ll do
everything in his power to stop us.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: But with three men trying, one of us might
be able to make it.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>80 continued: 80</strong>: One of them hisses for silence,
all conversation ends. And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the
distance. Faint, but growing closer.</p>
<p><strong>mercenary</strong>: Shoot low. We’ll need their heads for
identification.</p>
<p><strong>81 ext. road to calais - night 81</strong>: An overturned
wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter the roadway. The wagon’s
driver, an old FARMER, sits on one of the kegs, holding his head.
D’Artagnan and the Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a
stop.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Thank God for a friendly face. My horse
broke loose. Can you help me move these kegs out of the road?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Stay on your horse.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: He needs our help.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll help him.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Won’t you step down… Musketeers?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put away your
weapons and remove these kegs from the road. We’d prefer to ride on
without having to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: You’re threatening us?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: It’s not a threat, it’s a fact. If you
don’t haul those kegs away, you’re dead where you stand.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Mine hit the ground first.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Mine was taller.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: There’s only one rule, d’Artagnan – stay
alive.</p>
<p><strong>82 continued: 82</strong>: Present are the INNKEEPER, his
wife, a few benighted tra- velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the
door flies open and the Musketeers and d’Artagnan enter from a RAGING
STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear the brims of
their hats pulled low to cover their faces.</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: See to our horses and bring us some food.</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: I’m sorry but we have little to spare.
The Cardinal’s Guards were here today. They helped themselves to our
food and then refused to pay.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: In the name of God, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid #1</strong>: Musketeers!</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: Musketeers in my house! Gentlemen, put
away your swords and come in. Anyone who fights the Cardinal is welcome
here.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I think we’ve found a home.</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: We don’t have much but what we have is
yours.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Ladies, you’re in for a treat tonight.
Allow me to introduce myself. I’m the Musketeer they call Porthos.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Porthos.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: It’s hard to believe they haven’t heard of
the great Porthos.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Oh, shut up, Aramis.</p>
<p><strong>barmaids</strong>: Aramis? Did you say Aramis?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I don’t get it. I just don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. tavern - night 83</strong>: Moments later. Porthos
regales the Barmaids with a tale.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I said, ‘A Queen is no different than a
barmaid in the dark. Though less… practiced in the arts of
pleasure…’</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: If you’re going to be a proper Musketeer,
you’ll have to learn the manly art of wenching. Right, ladies?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Ahh, very good. Your first subject. But
you’ll need instruction. Watch closely.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: The secret to wenching is the first kiss.
For in that kiss, a lasting impression is made. If it is weak, she will
think you are weak. And if it is comical, she will think you are a
clown. With me?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Weak… weak. Comical… clown.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Very good. And as a Musketeer is never
weak, and only rarely a clown, your first kiss must be all the things
that you are. Like this…</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: You may speak first if you like, your name,
her name, an endearment or two. But words are usually a waste of
time.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Only if you don’t know which words to
say.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Words may make a more lasting impression
than a thousand of Porthos’ kisses.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: Not likely.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I’ll demonstrate. Please. Sit beside me.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: ’Shall I compare thee to a Thou art more
lovely and more Rough winds do shake the darling And summer’s leash hath
all too Sometime too hot the eye of heaven And often is his gold
complexion And every fair from fair sometimes By chance, or nature’s
changing But thy eternal summer shall not</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Nor lose possession of that fair Nor shall
death brag thou When in eternal lines to time thou So long as men can
breathe, or eyes So long lives this, and this gives</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: That’s cheating.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Come on, d’Artagnan. We haven’t got all
night.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: ’Shall I compare thee to a summer’s Thou
are move lovely and more Ahh, to hell with it –</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: The boy’s a natural.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: So little time, so much to learn.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: In all the years I’ve know him… I have never
seen Athos smile.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Why is he sitting by himself?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Athos takes his drinking seriously. Ignore
him. He’ll be his usual warm, charming self by morning. Service! My lap
is cold!</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Come join us.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: You fight like a Musketeer. Let’s see if you
can drink like one.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’ll drink anything you put in front of
me.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Famous last words. What shall we drink
to?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Love?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Love. Would you like to hear a story,
d’Artagnan? A love story?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I once knew a man… one of the Counts of
Berry. My native province. When the good Count was about your age, he
fell in love with a visitor from Paris. A breathtaking girl of
seventeen. She was more than beautiful, d’Artagnan. She was…
intoxicating. And this man, the poor idiot, he married her.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Isn’t that what people do when they fall
in love?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Be quiet and listen. The Count took her to
his castle and made her the first lady of the province. They were happy
for a time, as happy as a man and a woman can be. Then one day, while
riding in the woods, the girl was thrown from her horse, and knocked
unconscious. The Count hurried to help her. Her dress was torn.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: On her her arm, the woman wore a gold band in
the shape of a serpent. It was the only article of clothing she refused
to remove. The Count’s curiosity got the best of him. He reached over
and slid down the gold band. He saw something on her arm… something
she’d kept hidden ’til then…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: The fleur d’lis. She’d been branded…</p>
<p><strong>85 another angle 85</strong>: D’Artagnan reacts with
shock.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: The Count’s angel turned out to be a
murderess who escaped the Executioner’s blade. She swore that she loved
him. Swore that she had changed. And if he would just keep her secret,
they would live a long life together.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: But the Count was young and he was stupid. He
was tormented by the ridicule of his social class. And so he rejected
her. For her lies and for her past. And turned her over to the
authorities to be executed for the crime.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: But you see… his heart did not agree. The
Count soon realized what she had meant to him. And what he had done.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: That his… betrayal was far greater than her
own. Soon after he foreswore the society that shaped him. Gave up his
title. And was never seen again.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: He loved her.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: He killed her. It seemed like the same thing
after a while.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Good. More for me.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Aramis – play something with some blood in
it! I feel like dancing!</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Care to dance, Athos?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Only if I can lead.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Aramis! Athos made a joke!</p>
<p><strong>86 angle 86</strong>: The Innkeeper comes down the stairs
wearing a nightshirt and a sleepy expression.</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Were we making too much noise?</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: You told me to wake you at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: It’s dawn.</p>
<p><strong>87 ext. rural landscape - day 87</strong>: The sun rises,
casts long shadows across a sparkling dew- wet field. D’Artagnan and the
Musketeers ride INTO FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais.
D’Artagnan squints ahead, wincing with every bump. Porthos grins.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Beautiful morning, eh, d’Artagnan?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: You know, d’Artagnan, it’s not a good idea
to travel on an empty stomach. You really should have had a big portion
of those sheep’s brains…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: My head feels like it’s filled with the
King’s marching band. Would you please stop whistling?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Whistling? I’m not whistling.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Well someone is.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: The Barmaid’s kiss left him dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I hear it too. It sounds like…</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: A connon ball.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I hate cannon balls.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: How’s your head now?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’m beginning to wish the Cardinal had
chopped if off.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Stay with us, and you just might get your
wish.</p>
<p><strong>87 continued: 87</strong>: They ride as fast their mounts
will carry them. A cross- roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation,
shouts command.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Split in half! D’Artagnan rides with me!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: We’ll see you in Calais!</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Or hell!</p>
<p><strong>88 int. queen’s bath - day 88</strong>: A room heavy with
mist and steam. Behind a maze of gauze screens, we discover Anne
reclining in a large tiled bath, Constance attending. Constance
replenishes the bath with pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling
cauldron. In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: But how, your Majesty? How can you tell
if you’re really in love?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Do you think about him all the time?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And when he’s around, do your knees feel as
weak as water?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And when he looks at you, do you suddenly
forget how to breathe?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Then you’re in love.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: knowledge; knew it</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: You’ll never believe it.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Of course I will.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: You won’t.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: The young man who rescued us from the
bandit.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: The young man on the scaffold?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re right. I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Are you in love, Your Majesty?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What an impertinent question.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: My love… is a matter of state. It’s
complicated.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Do you think about him all the time?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: As Queen, my mind touches on many
subjects.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Do your knees feel as weak as water?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: When he looks at you, do you forget how
to breathe?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I hope he will someday. I hope I will too.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Constance, have you seen my…?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your Majesty, forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Cardinal.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I need your help. And could not in good
conscience wait another minute.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You want my help?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: On what matter?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your… husband.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Richelieu’s last</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Of course. As Your Eminence has been kind
enough to advise me… It’s the least I can do.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I am worried about the King’s…
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: The Huguenot rebellion, occupation in the
Antilles and Cayenne. The coming war with France. These are not the
usual hobbies of youth.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: And now he wishes to postpone his
birthday celebration.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: He feels it is not… appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It sounds as though he is concerned with more
important matters.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Which is exactly why we must celebrate.
To show the world that the King of France is strong enough to face any
enemy on any field. To show France… that he is King. He will listen to
you. If you will speak.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I will speak to him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Now, if you’ll excuse me, I…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your Majesty? Please understand that I do
not underestimate the value of your assistance.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: And that I wish for you to consider – in
fact, to know – all that you and I might accomplish. Together. For
France.</p>
<p><strong>90 ext. louvre - day 90</strong>: Infantry troops drill
outside the King’s palace, prac- ticing muskets and sabers.</p>
<p><strong>91 int. throne room - day 91</strong>: Louis watches from a
balcony. Richelieu appears, fresh from his encounter with the Queen.
Louis looks up, greets him with displeasure.</p>
<p><strong>92 int. throne room and great hall 92</strong>: Louis watches
from a balcony. Richelieu appears, fresh from his encounter with the
Queen.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I’m sorry to be late, Your Majesty, but I
was wrestling with an important matter of state.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why is it I don’t see any of my
Musketeers?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I’m afraid… that’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: They have become outlaws. They are
terrorizing the countryside, robbing and killing innocent people.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: There must be some mistake.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: No mistake. I have reports from the local
constables involved.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Musketeers…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: They are better off disbanded.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Your Eminence, I’ve been hearing some very
troubling rumors about you.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: There are so many to choose from. Is it
the one about my alleged alliance with Buckingham? Let’s see if I
remember it correctly. While the English attack from without, I’ll
undermine the throne from within – depose you – and become sovereign of
France myself. That rumor, Your Majesty?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It does seem rather farfetched.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: If there are any doubts of my loyalty,
they’ll be put to rest when we appear together at your birthday
celebration.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ve been thinking about that. A birthday
celebration when we’re on the brink of war…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your subjects are eager to celebrate the
birth of their King at a time like this.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m not so eager.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I have an idea. Why don’t you discuss the
matter with your Queen?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: My horse will not survive another
league.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Ten, twenty at the most.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Here’s just the thing. A nice, relaxing
boat ride.</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: A privilege to carry you on my humble
boat…</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: Two pistoles.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But I only have one. Couldn’t my child ride
free? She’s so small…</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: Two pistoles.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Put away your money, madame. You and your
child will cross the river under our protection. For free.</p>
<p><strong>94 continued: 94</strong>: All turn to regard Aramis on
horseback, Porthos at his side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise.
The Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and protests.</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: Nobody rides for free! Under your
protection bloody well indeed! I’ll teach you a thing or two about
protection! Apple- cheeked young fools!! – Just who do you think you
are!!</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: tirade to cease;</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: Musketeers? Well, why didn’t you say so?
Of course you’ll ride for free. I insist on it. This way, pretty madame.
My what a lovely little girl…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Porthos!</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: We sail!</p>
<p><strong>95 hill and shore 95</strong>: The pursuers charge down the
hill and ride to the end of the dock but they’re too late. Porthos and
Aramis have gotten away.</p>
<p><strong>96 flatboat 96</strong>: Porthos laughs and taunts the angry
pursuers. Aramis ties scarves around the horses’ eyes to blindfold them
for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what Aramis is already
seeing – the two Cavaliers watch them with keen interest.</p>
<p><strong>first cavalier</strong>: You’re those Musketeers everyone’s
been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Popularity has its price.</p>
<p><strong>first cavalier</strong>: I have some excellent brandy here.
Would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the Cardinal?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: We’d be happy to.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: If you’ll drink one with us to the
King.</p>
<p><strong>second cavalier</strong>: But the only King we recognize… is
the Cardinal.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: There are those who would call that
treason.</p>
<p><strong>first cavalier</strong>: Happily, no such objections have
been raised… here.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: All right. I’ll object.</p>
<p><strong>second cavalier</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Let’s see. You are, by your dress and by
your manner, members of a bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose
slavish allegiance to His Eminence the Cardinal is as that of a dog who
likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day
before.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Piss is piss, no matter what robes surround
it.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Well said. I’m impressed. Ninnyhammers.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I was momentarily inspired.</p>
<p><strong>first cavalier</strong>: May I reply?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: By all means.</p>
<p><strong>first cavalier</strong>: Better to be a dog in the service of
a great master, than a beef- witted moron so dazzled by the throne that
he does not see the true nature of the foolish boy who wobbles atop it.
Which is to say, that most muddy-brained of all men… a Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Maybe there’s something about us that just
pisses people off. At least I’d like to think so. It’s too bad we can
only kill them once.</p>
<p><strong>97 continued: 97</strong>: Porthos drives his opponent about
the flatboat with a devilish grin, chases him between – and at one
point, over – blindfolded horses. Aramis duels with the expected
artistry, gradually re- ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture,
the child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of the flatboat,
the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a neat sidestep, stops the
child’s desperate progress with one arm while continuing to do battle
with the other. He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I’ve been called a lot of things in my
time…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Porthos…</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: But beef-witted is a little more than I can
stand, not to mention unfair…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Porthos…</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Can you swim?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: No. My horse can.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: That’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: But…?</p>
<p><strong>97 continued: 97</strong>: Aramis hurries to his horse, takes
off the blindfold. Porthos grumbles after, follows suit. They leap atop
their mounts, the horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to
the edge.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: You go first and I’ll watch your
progress.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: No, no. Please. After you.</p>
<p><strong>aramis and porthos</strong>: One, two – three!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Thank you. God speed.</p>
<p><strong>98 on shore 98</strong>: The Cardinal’s Guards react with
anger and disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>99 river 99</strong>: A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER.
Porthos clinging to his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on
his fellow Musketeer… and the deep rapids up ahead. Through twists and
turns, walls of white water, huge boulders, and gyrating whirlpools…
Aramis and Porthos finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond.
They lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land… and see yet
another patrol of Cardinal’s Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their
arrival. Porthos looks down at his latest sash – destroyed like the
others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: A nice relaxing boat ride…</p>
<p><strong>99 continued: 99</strong>: And with that, Aramis and Porthos
charge towards the Guards.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Do you think we’ve lost them?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: They’ll catch up eventually.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: My father used to hunt in a forest like
this. He promised to take me on my tenth birthday. I don’t know why he
picked that year. Something about a boy becoming a man. I’d lay in bed
at night and imagine it, just the two of us. But he died before I could
go with him.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Well. You have your boyhood wish at last. The
dark forest. The thrill of the hunt. The nearness of death.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’d be proud to die for my King.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I just wanted to save you from the life of a
Musketeer. You don’t have to go looking for experience, d’Artagnan.
It’ll find you soon enough. And when it does – it will mark you
forever.</p>
<p><strong>101 ext. forest - day 101</strong>: Athos leads d’Artagnan
through the forest. Sunbeams shoot down through thick branches like
golden bars. A pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING
HOOFBEATS. Athos and d’Artagnan turn in surprise, see SIX HORSEMEN
CRASHING through the glade.</p>
<p><strong>102 another angle 102</strong>: Athos and d’Artagnan GALLOP
through the dense forest. The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT
grazes d’Artagnan’s shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount. Athos
leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at the top. The climb is
fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all around them. Athos’ horse is struck by
a bullet, stag- gers forward… and collapses just as they reach the
crest. D’Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with Athos behind the
boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen
below. The others curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ
back and forth like angry hornets. Stalemate, but not for long. They are
badly outnumbered. The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree
to tree. Athos turns to d’Artagnan as he reloads:</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I’ll hold them off for as long as I can. Go
on without me.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I can’t leave you here. Not like
this.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Ride to Calais and stop the Cardinal’s
agent.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Athos… I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Go, or I’ll kill you myself.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: A duel then.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: We never finished the first.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: All right. I’ll toss a coin. Tails I stay,
heads you remain. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>103 athos and his pov 103</strong>: Heads. D’Artagnan is to
remain. Athos looks up without missing a beat.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Tails. I stay.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But…?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: At least take my pistol.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Don’t let us down… Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’ll never forget you.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>104 d’artagnan 104</strong>: He rides, straining to hear the
sounds of GUNFIRE. As long as the SHOTS continue, he knows Athos is
alive. Abruptly… the SHOTS CEASE. D’Artagnan swallows his heart, and
rides.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: What is it, Henri?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: There’s a body in the road, Milady.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: It’s a young man. He appears to be
injured.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: My, what a handsome boy. Put him inside with
me.</p>
<p><strong>106 d’artagnan’s pov - black screen 106</strong>: Out of the
darkness, a face appears, BLURRY and OBSCURED. It FILLS the SCREEN,
slowly swimming INTO FOCUS. It is Milady de Winter, even more beautiful
in CLOSEUP. Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory combs gleam in her
hair. She smiles warmly.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Welcome back. Did you dream?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I… saw you in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Where am I…?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: This is Calais.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Calais! The ship… Tuesday at
midnight…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Where are my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Filthy. I’m having them cleaned. Is
something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What day is it? What time?!</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: It’s Tuesday, near nine.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Nine? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Quite sure.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Are you in a hurry?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: How did I… get here?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I found you in the road. Discarded. Like an
unwanted kitten. Do you have a name or shall I make one up for you?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: My name is d’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: D’Artagnan. I like that. I am the Countess
de Winter. Milady.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Countess?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: My husband’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I have learned to live with death.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Countess, I’m very grateful for what
you’ve done, but I can’t stay here. I’ve got…</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Important business.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: How mysterious. A handsome young man with
‘important business’ in the still of night. Does it involve a young
lady?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Does it require clothes?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes. I need my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: They won’t be ready for at least an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: An hour?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I told the innkeeper to bring them when they
are dry. Until then, I’m afraid you are my prisoner. Would the prisoner
care for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I am… thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Good. Then we will sit by the fire, and eat
and drink, and you may impress, perhaps even move me, with the story of
how you came to lie unconscious, in the middle of the night, on the road
to Calais. I love a good adventure.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. roof of palais cardinal - night 108</strong>: A
CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters its box. The
little door on the other side opens. A hand reaches in and removes the
bird. Richelieu unpeels the message on its leg.</p>
<p><strong>109 int. cardinal’s private chamber - night 109</strong>: A
room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind Richelieu’s desk, there is a
life-sized portrait of the King. Rochefort occupies a window seat,
cleaning d’Artagnan’s sword. He lifts it to the light, and slashes the
air. He stands, duels with an imaginary opponent. Richelieu enters with
the message.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: The wonderful thing about an imaginary
opponent is that he is always greatly skilled, and always easily
defeated. The pride of victory, without the risk of loss. If only life
were like that.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Milady has reached Calais.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I told you not to worry about the
Musketeers. They are dead by now.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Buckingham’s signature will be on the
treaty by morning.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: The King’s birthday celebration…?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Will proceed as planned. Thanks to the
kind intercession of Queen Anne.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: And our plans…?</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Will proceed as well.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: You are sad.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I was thinking about my friends.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The three best friends a man could have.
We were separated on our way to Calais. I’m afraid I’ll never see them
again.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: What brings you here?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’d like to tell you. But I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: ‘Important business.’</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I understand. Men make bold plans in secret.
And women wait… to mourn, or to celebrate the outcome. I know from
experience, it’s a lonely vigil.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: All I can tell you is… I’m on a mission
for the King.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I’ve heard that one before.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: You are a young man. And young men are given
to exaggeration. However, if you would like to entertain me with a
story, I’m eager to hear it. And please, make it very brave, filled with
handsome knights and beautiful ladies. I know, a dragon –</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I came to Calais to stop a spy from
sailing to England.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: d’Artagnan doesn’t</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I believe you… Aren’t you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Musketeers are not afraid of
anything.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I knew it. I knew you were a Musketeer the
moment I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Of course. But, d’Artagnan, if this spy was
to find out you are here, your life could be in grave danger.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: A Musketeer is not afriad of danger.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I’m dangerous. You’re not afraid of me?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You’re not dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Then what am I?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You’re… beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Beauty, danger. They are the same.</p>
<p><strong>111 on d’artagnan 111</strong>: He cannot continue.
Constance, the hour, a confusion he cannot deny.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What’re you doing?! Have you lost your
mind?!</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: You came to Calais to stop a spy from
sailing to England.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Parker!!</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: You can kill me. But a surprise waits
for you in England. That even Buckingham can’t prevent.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: What… surprise?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: That’s one thing I’ll never tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: D’Artagnan. You are young, vain, and
foolish. But I do not know if you are clever.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: We’ll take him with us.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: with a nod at</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: The bodyguards are waiting outside.</p>
<p><strong>113 angle to include milady and her pov 113</strong>: The
innkeeper, roused from sleep, and wearing a night- shirt, is engaged in
urgent conversation with Armand de Winter – the son of the man Milady
killed in Paris. The innkeeper shakes his head. Armand grabs him by the
collar.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: The back stairs. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>115 int. carriage - night 115</strong>: D’Artagnan and Parker
sit across from Milady. Her face betrays faint doubt, apprehension.
Emotions she is not used to feeling, let alone displaying to the world
around her. D’Artagnan sees his opening… and speaks:</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: The man at the inn… what did he
want?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Justice. Honor. Revenge.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: He is the brother of my late husband, Lord
de Winter. He blames me for de Winter’s death. He thinks I murdered
him.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Did you murder your husband, Milady?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I think he’s not the first husband you
killed. I once knew a man, one of the Counts of Berry. He told me a
story… of beauty and danger. He was the bravest man I’ve ever known. And
the saddest.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>116 ext. calais - night 116</strong>: Milady’s carriage turns
down a steep lane that leads to the harbor. The fog is so thick that
only the masts of the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom.
Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a stop.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: What’s the matter, d’Artagnan? Still hoping
for your friends to ride to the rescue?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: My friends are dead.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Well. If it’s any consolation, you’ll soon
be joining them.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: We are the Countess de Winter’s party,
arrived from Paris. Permission to come aboard.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Permission granted.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Take us to your captain.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: What are you, deaf?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguards</strong>: Dead! They’re all dead!</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Well I certainly hope so. After all that
hard work.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: You look like you’ve seen a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Two of them.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Remind me to tell you the story of horses
that could fly above raging waters. A heroic tale of love, death, and
Musketeers. Suitable for the general public.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: All right then. All those who wish to die,
raise your hands! Don’t by shy, there’s plenty to go around!</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Sorry I’m late. Did I miss anything?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Keep your mind on the mission,
d’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>119 continued: 119</strong>: Athos and d’Artagnan find
themselves fighting side by side. Athos observes d’Artagnan’s technique
– the usual frenetic windmill of feint and thrust – with a frown.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Boy, it’s a miracle you’re still alive
fighting like that.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: First, always find your enemy’s weakness.
Second, take advantage of it. Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Find the weakness. Take advantage. Got
it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That’s our ship…</p>
<p><strong>121 continued: 121</strong>: Porthos hears them coming,
spins. The two Sailors stop in their tracks, eyes popping with horrified
recognition.</p>
<p><strong>both sailors</strong>: Porthos the Pirate!!</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: I told you I was famous.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Porthos the Pirate?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Privateer. There’s a difference.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I love a good sea story. Do tell me
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>122 high angle 122</strong>: The battle raging aboard the
Persephone, sabers flash,</p>
<p><strong>123 back to scene 123</strong>: Athos drives several
Bodyguards back with his sword, notices d’Artagnan working his way
towards him.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Did you find the Cardinal’s spy?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Athos. The spy… is a woman.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. pier - night 124</strong>: With the speed and grace
of a panther, Milady runs down the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of
one of her Bodyguard’s horses, and gallops off. Athos appears moments
later, leaps into the saddle of another horse. And gives chase.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Stop!!</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Athos.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: How did you do it, Sabine? How did you come
back from the dead?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: A kind gentleman took pity on me.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I did not.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: No, Count. You were too proud to listen to
the truth. I learned the value of lies soon after.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Give me the Cardinal’s treaty.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Then I will shoot.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Be kind. And aim for my heart.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I remember… everything.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Countess de Winter…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: The treaty outlines Richelieu’s plan to
forge an alliance with Buckingham.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: What about the King?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: He is not mentioned directly. But the
agreement is contingent on a ‘demonstration’ of the Cardinal’s
power.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: A demonstration? What does that
mean?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I know someone who does.</p>
<p><strong>127 int. private room - night 127</strong>: A fire burns in
the grate. Milady sits beside it in a chair, staring into the glowing
embers. Their hot re- flection dances in her pale blue eyes. There is a
KNOCK at the door. Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner of the
room where he has been standing guard with an impassive executioner. He
crosses to the door, opens it. And Athos steps inside.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I’d like a word with your prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: She dies at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Did you come to offer me consolation?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: There was a time when I would’ve given my
life for a kind word.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I could not give it, Sabine. I was… a
fool.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Did you kill his brother and his father as he
says?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: honest at the</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: But not before. Not us.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: No. The memory will keep me company.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Do you know the Cardinal’s plans?</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Will you spare my life?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: Society demands swift justice. I’ll take the
secret to my grave.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Sabine. You’ll die for your crimes. Nothing
can stop that. But how you leave this world is up to you.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: What did the world ever do for me?</p>
<p><strong>128 ext. seaside cliffs - night 128</strong>: A hundred feet
below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On the jagged cliff above, a black
mass of trees is outlined against a stormy sky filled with
copper-colored clouds, surreal in effect. A sinister procession
approaches the cliff. Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white
shift, her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years younger,
the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks behind them. Followed by
Armand de Winter, Aramis, d’Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every
step.</p>
<p><strong>128 continued: 128</strong>: The Executioner delivers the
formal litany:</p>
<p><strong>executioner</strong>: I forgive you for your crimes. Die in
peace.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Die in peace.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I am the resurrection and the life, sayeth
the Lord. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die…</p>
<p><strong>executioner</strong>: On your knees.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>executioner</strong>: What’s this…?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Athos –</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Forgive me, Sabine. Please forgive.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>milady</strong>: The Cardinal intends to assassinate the King
at his birthday celebration on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>executioner</strong>: God’s justice be done.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: The King’s life in danger. We have work to
do.</p>
<p><strong>130 another angle 130</strong>: REVEALS Richelieu and
Rochefort as they walk across the roof to the painting, appraise the
damage. Thie Cardinal pokes a long finger into the hole.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Impressive.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: He can do it every time.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: And he has no qualms about…</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: None. He believes that man should honor
no Kings before God.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: A man of faith. How delightful. Whatever
you’re paying him, double it. I want the King’s birthday to be a
memorable event. And rehang this painting in my chamber. Just as it
is.</p>
<p><strong>131 dawn 131</strong>: breaks. MUSIC UP, and…</p>
<p><strong>133 ext. another village - day 133</strong>: A CAPTAIN in the
Cardinal’s Guard makes a public pronouncement from horseback outside a
cathedral. Townspeople are gathered around.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: … the aforenamed Musketeers are declared
outlaws and are sentenced to death. Any person sheltering or aiding them
will be hanged –</p>
<p><strong>134 int./ext. various scenes - day 134</strong>: As the word
is passed to Musketeers in homes and pastures, brothels and gaming
casinos. Galvanizing them into action. All For One, And One For All.</p>
<p><strong>135 ext. paris - day 135</strong>: The city as SEEN FROM the
hills. A glorious sunny day.</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. louvre - day 136</strong>: The citizens of Paris
move through the streets. They share a common destination, the Palace. A
festive mood is in the air. And why not, it is the King’s birthday.</p>
<p><strong>137 int. louvre - great hall and throne room - day
137</strong>: A gathering of nobles and ladies, all in full ceremonial
dress. Rochefort is there as well, the familiar eye patch, in command of
the Cardinal’s Guards. A Seneschal waits at the door with two flanking
lines of trumpeteers. The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a
royal blast.</p>
<p><strong>138 entrance doors 138</strong>: Louis, Queen Anne, and their
retinue enter from a corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the
balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside. Noblemen bow, and
their ladies curtsy as the King and Queen pass. Constance, dressed for
the occasion, looks on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen
proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They look… happy.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hungry, more likely.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Still, you were right about the celebration.
And when the Cardinal told me how much it meant to you…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I said nothing.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But… ?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: The Cardinal expressed in confidence how much
the celebration would mean to you…</p>
<p><strong>139 int. anteroom - day 139</strong>: Richelieu stands in an
anteroom just off the procession, he watches the King and Queen as they
walk, speaks quietly, to himself:</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: I’m not sure which is sadder… to die so
young. Or to die a King.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: France will not go wanting. A new King
will sit on the throne. The true King after all…</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Is everything ready?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Yes, Your Eminence.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I’d stake my life on it, Your
Eminence.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Rest assured, Captain. You have.</p>
<p><strong>140 ext. grounds outside louvre - day 140</strong>: The
balcony has been colorfully decorated. The crowd focuses its attention
on the empty space where the King will soon appear. Below, the entrance
to the Palace is protected by a double line of the Cardinal’s Guards,
resplendent in their crimson tunics. It would take an army to get past
them.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Look through the surrounding area. We’ll try
to reach the King…</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: But…?</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>142 d’artagnan’s pov 142</strong>: The bell tower of the
Carmes-Deschaux monastery. A figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this
much is clear. The man is not a monk. And he is carrying a musket in his
hands.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I do not trust him.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m not sure who to trust.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Then we will discover the truth together.</p>
<p><strong>146 int. steeple - day 146</strong>: Bell ropes, hundreds of
feet long, dangle down the vertiginous shaft. D’Artagnan races up the
narrow, circular stairs. Above him is the open trap to the bell tower.
He catches a glimpse of the marksman, back turned, taking aim.</p>
<p><strong>147 in crowd below 147</strong>: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis
push their way through the crowd, trying desperately to reach the Palace
entrance. But the throng is impenetrable. Athos turns, wonders. And
shoots a worried look at the bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux, looming
against the sky, as if to intuit the danger lurking there.</p>
<p><strong>149 ext. bell tower - day 149</strong>: The marksman takes
careful aim. The cheering down below is like a faint whisper at this
altitude. The marksman cocks the hammer of his flinklock.</p>
<p><strong>150 int. steeple - day 150</strong>: D’Artagnan hears the
click of the musket’s hammer, and knows he must act now. He looks around
and sees his chance. D’Artagnan leaps off the stairs and grabs a handful
of rope, using his weight to RING the BELL overhead.</p>
<p><strong>152 ext. louvre - balcony - day 152</strong>: The SHOT misses
the King and EXPLODES INTO the WALL an inch from his head. Louis turns
to Richelieu – sees anger and disappointment flash on the Cardinal’s
face. Just for an instant… but it is enough.</p>
<p><strong>153 int./ext. louvre - day 153</strong>: Pandemonium, inside
and outside the Palace. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd
at the entrance, draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of
Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe what they are
seeing. Three men against a hundred. It’s ridiculous. But then… the
looks on Guards’ faces begin to change, subtly at first, from amusement
to horror.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Save the King!!</p>
<p><strong>155 ext. bell tower - day 155</strong>: D’Artagnan scrambles
up through the trapdoor, and tackles the marksman. As the BELL CONTINUES
TO CLANG, they fight hand-to-hand. The marksman forces d’Artagnan toward
the edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below. They remain
deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching d’Artagnan backward, certain
death behind him. And at the last moment, d’Artagnan summons up the
strength of three – and shoves the marksman backward with a resound- ing
kick.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. great hall and throne room - day 156</strong>:
Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to close the huge
door to the great hall. The members of the King’s royal court run in
panicked circles, convinced the palace is under seige. Constance pauses
amid the riot, seeks the Queen.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your Majesty…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Leave us… alone.</p>
<p><strong>157 another angle 157</strong>: The great door shudders under
the impact of a terrific blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is
plunged into further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward, press
their bodies against the door to secure it. BOOM – the great door
threatens to split in half. Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the
rising panic. His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis
and Anne across the room.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Kill him. Kill her, too.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Get behind me.</p>
<p><strong>157 continued: 157</strong>: Louis breaks into a wide grin.
The Musketeers wade into the Guards, and the great hall is transformed
into a bat- tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops. Are we
interrupting?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: Not for long.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>158 continued: 158</strong>: Rochefort goes sprawling. He
loses his sword, it slides across the floor until someone’s foot stops
it. Rochefort looks up… and sees d’Artagnan standing on the blade.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: This sword belongs to me.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: D’Artagnan. Kill him where he stands.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: By all means. Let’s discover if you are
as brave a man as your father was. And as foolish.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: revelation as it</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: He died for his King and for France. But
most of all… he died on the end of my sword. As will you.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: This is for you, Father.</p>
<p><strong>159 angle to include chamber 159</strong>: A FIRE ROARS in a
great stone hearth. Its light pro- jects giant shadows on the wall as
d’Artagnan and Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.</p>
<p><strong>160 great hall 160</strong>: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take
the fight to the Cardinal’s Guards. Each with his by-now familiar
tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: One thing’s certain. You’re no
Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Take it back…?</p>
<p><strong>rochefort</strong>: I might… have been… mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>161 continued: 161</strong>: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter
the room. D’Artagnan stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,
clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d’Artagnan’s look of triumph…</p>
<p><strong>162 int. great hall and throne room - day 162</strong>: A
short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers have won. On the
dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu who is a prisoner now, guarded
by several Musketeers. Louis holds the recovered treaty in his
hands.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Your Majesty, that document is an obvious
forgery. I am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and
perpetuated by these three Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: This is a complicated matter, Your Eminence,
affecting both France and the crown…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And so, until such time as I and my advisors
– – can determine the whole truth of the matter. I invite you to await
our decision in the comfort of… the Bastille.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: You can’t do this to me. I’m the Cardinal
of France.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And I am its King.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And as King… I hereby reinstate the
Musketeers.</p>
<p><strong>richelieu</strong>: Congratulations, Monsieur d’Artagnan.
I’ll be keeping an eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: Thank you, Your Eminence. I’ll be
watching you, too.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Is this the young man who saved my life?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: His name’s d’Artagnan, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Approach, d’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I have something that belongs to … Your
Majesty…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Thank you, d’Artagnan. But the bracelet does
not belong to me. It belongs to her.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: D’Artagnan, I am in your debt. What can I do
to repay the courage you’ve shown me? Anything, D’Artagnan. Whatever
your heart desires…</p>
<p><strong>athos</strong>: Majesty, his heart has only one desire. To
become a Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then kneel, d’Artagnan.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The world is an uncertain realm, filled with
danger. Truth despoiled by broken promises. Honor undermined by the
pursuit of gold. Freedom sacrificed when the weak are oppressed by the
strong. But there are those who oppose these powerful forces. Those who
dedicate their lives to truth, honor, and freedom. They are a constant
reminder to all of us. That such a life is not just possible, but
necessary to our continued survival. As a country, as a King. These men
are known as the Musketeers…</p>
<p><strong>162 continued: 162</strong>: As Louis speaks, D’Artagnan
closes his eyes; countless images rush through his mind. His home in
Gascony, Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first
encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their adventures together,
the face of Milady. It’s been a busy week.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Rise, d’Artagnan. And join them.
Musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Do my eyes deceive me?</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: I find it hard to believe myself.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: His lips, unused as they are to such a
contortion, twisted and stretched… into a smile.</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: It was spectacular. And what teeth.</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: I know this is a stupid question. But
what exactly does a Musketeer do?</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Truth… honor…</p>
<p><strong>aramis</strong>: And freedom.</p>
<p><strong>porthos</strong>: Weren’t you listening?</p>
<p><strong>d’artagnan</strong>: All for one…</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: … And one for all!!</p>
