<h1 id="ed-wood">ed-wood</h1>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Greetings, my friend. You are interested
in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable… that is why you are
here. So now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of
what happened… We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the
secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying
ordeal. The incidents, the places, my friend, we cannot keep this a
secret any longer. Can your hearts stand the shocking facts of the true
story of Edward D. Wood, Junior??</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, my dove just flew out the
window!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: She goes on in two minutes! What are we
gonna do??</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dolores, give me your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The ghost can be barefoot. Give me your
shoes!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>actor #1</strong>: Hey, I think I see something!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I offer you mortals the bird of peace, so
that you may change your ways and end all this destruction.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What a show! Everyone was terrific! Paul, your
second-act monologue actually gave me chills,</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Aw thanks, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I got the early edition! It was just dropped
off at the newsstand.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is the big moment…!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: What does that old queen know? He wasn’t even
there! Sending a copy boy to do his dirty work. Well fuck him!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Do I really have a face like a horse?</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: What does “ostentatious” mean?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey. Hey, it’s not that bad. You just can’t
concentrate on the negative. He’s got some nice things to say… See, “The
soldier costumes are very realistic.” That’s positive!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hell, I’ve seen a lot worse reviews. I’ve seen
ones where they didn’t even like the costumes! Like, that last “Francis
the Mule” picture – it got terrible notices. But it was a huge hit.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Lines around the block.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So don’t take it too seriously. We’re all doin’
great work.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Absolutely! It’s just the beginning. I promise
this: If we stick together, one day I’ll make every single one of you
famous.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Honey, what if I’m wrong? What if I just don’t
have it?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, it was only one review.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Orson Welles was 26 when he made “Citizen Kane.”
I’m already 30!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, you’re still young. This is the part of
your life when you’re supposed to be struggling.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I know… But sometimes I get scared this is as
good as it’s gonna get…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Things’ll change for us. Nobody stays on
the fringe forever.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: God, where’s my pink sweater? I can never
find my clothes anymore…</p>
<p><strong>rude boss</strong>: Hey big shot, get off your ass. They need
a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Whoa, look at all this sand. This is real sand!
My God, where’d they get all this sand?!</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Hey, YOU. This is a closed set.</p>
<p><strong>old crusty man</strong>: Hey, Eddie! Come in here. I got some
great new stuff to show you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is fantastic! What are you gonna do with it
all?</p>
<p><strong>old crusty man</strong>: Eh, probably file it away and never
see it again.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s such a waste. If I had half a chance, I
could make an entire movie out of this stock footage! See, the story
opens with these mysterious explosions. Nobody knows what’s causing
them, but it’s upsetting all the buffalo. So the military is called in
to solve the mystery.</p>
<p><strong>old crusty man</strong>: Ya forgot the octopus.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, I’m saving that for the big underwater
climax!</p>
<p><strong>secretary #1</strong>: They say he was a girl trapped in a
man’s body.</p>
<p><strong>secretary #2</strong>: I’ll bet it hurt when they snipped his
thing off.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What are you ladies gabbin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>secretary #1</strong>: You know that Christine Jorgensen
freak? He/she/it’s in “Variety.” Some producer is making a biopic.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: R-really? I didn’t see the story.</p>
<p><strong>secretary #1</strong>: Ah, it was buried in the back. The
guy’s a real small�time operator.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, I don’t understand. Why are you the
most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Aw, er, it’s just a bunch of hot air. I had to
say something to get in the door.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes, I’m Ed Wood. I’m here about directing the
Christine Jorgensen picture.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.
It ain’t gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn
“Variety” printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch
is asking for the sky.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So you’re not gonna make the movie?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: No, of COURSE I’m gonna make the movie!
I’ve already pre�sold Alabama and Oklahoma. Those repressed Okies really
go for that twisted pervert stuff. So we’ll just make it without that
she-male. We’ll fictitionalize it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Is there a script?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Fuck no! But there’s a poster.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, Mr. Weiss, I’m your guy. I work fast, and
I’m a deal: I write AND direct. And I’m good. I just did a play in
Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Hmm. There’s five-hundred guys in town who
can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of
“special qualifications.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, Mr. Weiss, I’ve never told anyone what I’m
about to tell you… but I really want this job. I like to dress in
women’s clothing.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Are you a fruit?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, no, not at all! I love women. Wearing their
clothes makes me feel closer to them.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: So you’re not a fruit?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Nah, I’m all man. I even fought in</p>
<p><strong>ww2.</strong>: ‘Course, I was wearing ladies’ undergarments
under my uniform.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: You gotta be kiddin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a
brassiere and panties. I’ll tell ya, I wasn’t scared of being killed,
but I was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover
my secret.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: And this is why you think you’re the most
qualified to make my movie?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. I know what it’s like to live with a
secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you… My
girlfriend still doesn’t know why her sweaters are always stretched
out.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but look
around you… I don’t hire directors with burning desires to tell their
stories. I make movies like “Chained Girls.” I need someone with
experience who can shoot a film in four days that’ll make me a profit.
I’m sorry. That’s all that matters.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Are you gonna get something else?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Too constrictive. This is the most
uncomfortable coffin I have ever been in.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Gee, Mr. Lugosi, I’ve never had any
complaints before.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: The selection is quite shoddy. You are wasting
my time.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I told you, I don’t want any of your goddamn
coffins.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. I don’t work here.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Who are you? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t want anything. I’m just a really big,
big fan. I’ve seen all your movies.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Ha!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Why were you buying a coffin?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Because I’m planning on dying soon.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Yes. I’m embarking on another bus- and�truck
tour of “Dracula.” Twelve cities in ten days, if that’s conceivable.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know, I saw you perform “Dracula.” In
Poughkeepsie, in 1938.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield
was a drunk!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I thought it was great. You were much scarier in
real life than you were in the movie.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I waited to get your autograph, but you never
came outside.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I apologize. When I play Dracula, I put myself
into a trance. It takes me much time to re-emerge.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Oh, there’s my bus. Shit, where’s my
transfer?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t you bave a car?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I refuse to drive in this country. Too many
madmen.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting
life. When is your next picture coming out?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I have no next picture.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ah, you gotta be jokin’! A great man like you…
I’ll bet you have dozens of ’em lined up.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Back in the old days, yes. But now – no one
give two fucks for Bela.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But you’re a big star!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: No more. I haven’t worked in four years. This
town, it chews you up, then spits you out. I’m just an ex-bogeyman. Make
a right.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: They don’t want the classic horror films
anymore. Today, it’s all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers –
who would believe such nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The old ones were much spookier. They had
castles, full moons…</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: They were mythic. They had a poetry to them.
And you know what else? The women prefer the traditional monsters.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The women?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: The pure horror, it both repels and attracts
them. Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony
of childbirth. The blood. The blood is horror.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I never thought of that.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Take my word for it. You want to “score” with
a young lady, you take her to see “Dracula.”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Ugh, what a mess. My wife of twenty years left
me last month. I’m not much of a housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Shh! I’m coming! I will feed you!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well… I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get
together again?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Certainly. But now the children of the night
are calling me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sweetie, you won’t believe it! I’ve got the most
incredible news!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You got the job?!!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn’t get the job. But
something better happened!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Better than not getting a job?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody really
big!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Who? Robert Taylor?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! A horror movie star!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Boris Karloff!?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Close! The other one!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You met Basil Rathbone!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I thought he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! He’s very alive. Well… sort of. He’s old,
and frail – but he’s still Bela Lugosi! And he’s really nice.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Boy, I can’t even remember the last time he
was in a picture.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s a shame. He’s such a rest actor, and nobody
uses him anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So did you get his autograph?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. It wasn’t like that at all. It was just the
two of us, and we were talkin’… and he treated me like – a friend…</p>
<p><strong>rude boss</strong>: He’s a bum.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No he’s not! Do you realize how much money he
made for this studio over the years? “Dracula”! “The Raven”! “The Black
Cat”!</p>
<p><strong>rude boss</strong>: Yeah? Well now he’s a junkie. He don’t
deserve to work.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s not true –</p>
<p><strong>rude boss</strong>: He’s so great, you hire him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, uh, if I could I would…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ugh! I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.
She doesn’t show ’em the proper respect.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I think she’s a honey. Look at those jugs.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Vampira! You will come under my spell! You
will be my slave of love.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey Bela, how do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: You must be double-jointed, and you must be
Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I am getting tired. I need to take my
medicine.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Do you want me to get it for you?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: No thank you, Eddie. I’ll be alright.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I feel better now.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Children! I love children.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Aren’t you scared, little boy? I’m going to
drink your blood!</p>
<p><strong>tough boy</strong>: Ehh, you’re not a real vampire. You can’t
turn into a bat, and those teeth don’t frighten me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well how about these teeth?!!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Hey, how’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dentures. I lost my pearlies in the war.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Are you sure this is okay?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Don’t worry. I do it every Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I am DRACULA!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I am the BAT!!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I am DRACUlA! I will LIVE FOREVER!!!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: So what’s the big news you couldn’t tell me
over the phone… again?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin’ about what you said,
about how all your movies have to make a profit. And I realized, what’s
the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it’ll be successful??</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Tits.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. Better than tits – a star!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Eddie, you must have me confused with David
Selznick. I don’t make major motion pictures. I make crap.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star
in it, you’d have something!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Yeah. Crap with a star.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! It would be something better! Something
impressive. The biggest moneymaker you’ve ever had!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Fine, maybe you’re right. But it doesn’t
friggin’ matter. I can’t afford a star, so I don’t even know what we’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What if I told you you could have a star for
$1000??</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Lugosi?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah! Lugosi!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Isn’t he dead?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, he’s not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I
met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: OUR picture?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uh, yeah. Our picture.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change
flick?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Because he’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Alright, fine! You can direct it. I want a
script in three days, and we start shooting a week from Monday.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Thank you! Bless you, Mr. Weiss! I promise I
won’t let you down!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know these people. I need all the
transsexuals and transvestites you can get. No, I don’t care if they’re
not actors. I want realism. I want this film to tell the truth! I’ve
waited my whole life for this shot, and I’m not gonna blow it.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, it’s gonna be a great picture! You’ll love
your character! Bunny, Bela’s here. Look, hit the bars, work some
parties, and get me transvestites! I need transvestites!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, what kind of movie is this?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, It’s about how people have two
personalities. The side they show to the world, and then the secret
person they hide inside.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde! Ah, I’ve always
wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde! I’m looking forward to this
production.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ehh, your part’s a little different. You’re like
the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees
everything.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well… you control everyone’s fate. You’re like
the puppetmaster.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Ah, so I pull the strings!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. You pull the strings – “Pull the strings”…
hey, that’s pretty good!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wipe off your hands. I’ve got a little surprise
for you… I finished my script.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, I’m so proud! I’ll read it as soon as I
get home.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, I’d really like to know what you think.
Why don’t you go in the bedroom and take a look at it? I’ll Wait…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So that’s where my sweater’s been.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: How long have you been doing this?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she
used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Jesus Christ! And you never told me?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is my way of telling you –</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: What, by putting it in a fuckin’ script,
for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like
that?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: And what about this so-called “Barbara”
character? It’s obviously ME! I’m so embarrassed! This is our life!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Of course it is. And that’s why you should play
the part.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Oh! You got nerve, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s a damn good role.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: That’s not the issue!! Ugh! How can you act
so casual, when you’re dressed like that?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It takes me comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Oh, just like in the script!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Exactly. So what do ya say? Do you wanna break
up… or do you wanna do the movie with me?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It’s good to have a job. Now I can get my
phone reconnected.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: I thought this was gonna be a sex- change
film!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: There’s still a sex-change –</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Yeah! Five pages right before it ends! The
rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t think he’s a schmuck.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: And what’s with this new title?! My poster
says “I CHANGED MY SEX”!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So change the poster. Trust me, you’ll be better
off. This is a story that’s gonna grab people. It’s about this guy. He’s
crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses. Should he tell her?
Should he not tell her? He’s torn. George, this is DRAMA.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Fine, shoot whatever baloney you want! I
give up. Just make sure it’s seven reels long.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me, could I have everyone’s attention?!
Could you gather around? I’ve got something to say.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Everybody, we’re about to embark on quite a
journey. Four days of hard work… but when it’s over, we’ll have a
picture that’ll entertain, enlighten, and maybe even move millions of
people.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Now the only way we’re gonna achieve all this is
if we stay on schedule. Day one – TODAY – we’ll start easy. We have
eighteen silent scenes that can be shot quickly: Cars parking, Patrick’s
suicide, me strolling as a man, me strolling as a woman, etc. After
lunch, we’ll bring in the Inspector and the Doctor. The Doctor is very
important to the plot, so we might have to spend time on retakes. But
it’s worth it. Scene totals for the first day is thirty-four. Day Two,
we’ll be a little busier –</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: Excuse me Eddie, I don’t mean to
interrupt… but I’m gettin’ a little worried about those clouds.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Good thinkin’. We’ll talk about Days Three and
Four later. Now let’s get that first shot off! It’s Scene 17, Glenda
looking in the window.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, do I need any touch-up?</p>
<p><strong>make-up man harry</strong>: I’m telling ya, eyelashes are the
way to go.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Harry, we’ve discussed this a million times. I
don’t want to look like a girl. I want to look like myself.</p>
<p><strong>make-up man marry</strong>: Fine. Then you look
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: And – ACTION!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And, CUT! PRINT IT! LET’S MOVE ON!</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: Don’t you want a second take, for
protection?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s to protect? It was perfect!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Cops!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We don’t have a permit. RUN!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The set doesn’t look right! It looks too… empty.
Clutter it up. Put a skeleton in the corner. And what’s that thing over
there?</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well it looks good. Let’s use it!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Ed! What’s with these revised pages?! A
scene in a smelting factory? A buffalo stampede?? Three-hundred soldiers
storming Anzio Beach??! What’s going on here? I can’t afford to film
this nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t worry. We’re not gonna film any of it.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Then how’s it gonna get in the
picture?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I know a guy in Universal’s stock house – he’s
giving me the footage for free. This movie’s gonna look like a million
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>o.s. voice</strong>: Mr. Lugosi has arrived!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh my God! Mr. Lugosi is here! Now everyone,
when he walks on the stage Now everyone, when he walks on the stage,
treat him normal. I know Bela Lugosi is a world-famous star, and you’re
all a little excited, but we’re professionals. So if you treat him with
respect, everything will be alright.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela! It’s so great to see you! And eight
o’clock on the dot. Right on time!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I am always on time.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Of course! Well, we got a big day planned for
you… First, we’re gonna start off a little easy, with you in that
armchair over there. Then, once you’re up to speed and cooking, we’ll
reset and bring out the laboratory equipment –</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Mr. Lugosi, I know you’re very busy, but
could I have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You know which movie of yours I love,
Mr. Lugosi? “The Invisible Ray.” You were great as Karloff’s
sidekick.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Sidekick”?? “KARLOFF”?!!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Fuck you!! Karloff doesn’t deserve to smell my
shit! That limey cocksucker can rot in hell, for all I care!!!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you
do?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nothin’! I told him he was great.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: How dare that asshole bring up Karloff?!! You
think it takes talent to play Frankenstein?! NO! It’s just make-up and
grunting! GRRR!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’re right, Bela. Now Dracula, that’s a part
that takes acting.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Of course! Dracula requires presence. It’s all
in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe
wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk… and then we’ll come back
and shoot the scene?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: BULLSHIT! I am ready now! Roll the
camera!!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Um, okay… roll camera</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sound!</p>
<p><strong>soundman</strong>: Speed.</p>
<p><strong>camera assistant</strong>: Mark. Scene Thirty-One.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And… action?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: How can you just walk around like that, in
front of all these people?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hon’, nobody’s bothered but you. Look around –
they couldn’t care less.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, this isn’t the real world! You’ve
surrounded yourself with</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Say it a little louder. I don’t think Bela heard
you in his trailer.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dolores. I need your help…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Music swells… and CUT and PRINT IT!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And we fade out. “The End.” What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: I think it’s fifty-seven minutes long.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to
do? Make it seven reels long. I’ve got contracts with my exhibitors. If
it ain’t over an hour, they won’t play it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Gee, I used every frame of film we shot. Maybe
they won’t notice.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: They’ll notice. Look, why don’t you let me
take over from here? I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock
footage, add establishing shots…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Um, I guess –</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Good. And one more thing. I think your
“Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood” credit is a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Why?! I did all those things! Hell, I even built
the props.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: And you did a bang-up job, too. But you
don’t want other producers to know that’s you in drag. Trust me. It’s a
career killer.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But I’m proud. I wrote, directed, and starred in
it just like Orson Welles in “Citizen Kane”!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Yeah?? Well Orson Welles didn’t wear angora
sweaters, did he??!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Daniel Who?!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, who is Daniel Davis?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: I didn’t shoot that!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Georgie, what’s with the stag footage?? You said
you were cutting in establishing shots!</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: I did. I established some tits and ass.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Wasn’t I something..? Did you see how I
command the screen?!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Ed, it was superb.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: A great show! A little strange… but great –
especially my scenes.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Just like I always promised. Now you’re among
the immortals. You’re movie stars.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Here’s to Ed. For making us into
something.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: From today on, our lives are different! We’ll be
swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I don’t know. It’s so much money…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who cares?! We’re on a ROLL! These are the
moments in life you’re supposed to grab.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: But Ed, we’re not even married. And you
don’t have a job.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But you do! And anyway, I’ve got tons of new
scripts. And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire
me!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look on the bright side. If we miss the rent,
what’s the worst they can do?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Toss us out on our ass.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How ’bout a western? People love westerns.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: But, I don’t like horses. Do I have to get on
one?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Eh, forget it. What else is big? Teenagers!
Jailbait pics! Yeah… You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend
from the wrong side of the tracks –</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Who do I play?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father. He’s angry!
He doesn’t like seeing his son – no – he doesn’t like seeing his
daughter behave this way!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Well… can’t I play the romantic part? I’m
tired of always being the bad guy. You know, back in Hungary, I played
Romeo! I would like to be the lover again – me, in a boat, with the
girl…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sure. Romance, that’s great! To engineer your
comeback, we’re gonna need a whole slate of pictures. Once “Glen Or
Glenda” takes off, we’ll slam you into one, then another, then
another!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: That’s good. I could use the money.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But we need to start off with a bang! Something
we know the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest
hit?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Hmm… my biggest hit? That would probably be
“Dracula.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Of course!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Those bastards at Universal. I made so much
money for them, and now I can’t get the time of day.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So let’s make another “Dracula.” Let’s make “The
Return of Dracula”!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: We can’t. Those sons-a-bitches control the
rights.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: They do? Shoot. There must be a way to get
around that…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ha-ha! Dr. Acula!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Dracula?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! Doctor Acula! You can still wear the cape,
have the fangs… but you’re a doctor! Not a count.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Ah! This is very exciting.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I gotta type this up, while it’s still
fresh!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me, I’m here to see Mr. Feldman.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Edward D. Wood, Junior.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Oh. Eh, he’s in the Executive Building. You
can park in the reserved section.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sir, Mr. Feldman will see you now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Mr. Ward, it’s a delight to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s Wood. Ed Wood.</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Wood? Ward? Wood. Hey, what do you
know. It is Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: So what are you bringing me? Looks like
you got some film cans.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to
show. I’ve got my own movie.</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Really?! Well good for you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I just made this picture, over at Screen
Classics. It opens next week.</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Screen Classics? Hmm, don’t know
them.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Nobody in town has seen it, so I’m givin’ you
first crack at my talents.</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: I can’t wait to take a look. So what’s
up next?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, Mr. Feldman, I don’t believe in thinking
small. So I’ve got a whole slate of pictures for you: “The Vampire’s
Tomb,” “The Ghoul Goes West”… and “Doctor Acula”!</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Doctor Acula? I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dr. Acula!</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Oh, “Dr. Acula.” I get it. I don’t like
it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But Bela Lugosi’s in it!</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Lugosi’s washed-up. What else you
got?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well… I’ve got another project I wasn’t gonna
tell you about. Lugosi’s in it, but he’s got a smaller part. The lead is
an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller. The title is
“Bride Of The Atom.”</p>
<p><strong>mr. feldman</strong>: Ah! Atomic Age stuff, huh? I like it.
I’ll tell you what, Mr. Ward. Why don’t you leave those film cans, and
my associates and I will take a look at your little opus. Maybe we can
do business together.</p>
<p><strong>solemn narrator</strong>: “Give this man satin undies, a
dress, and a sweater… and he’s the happiest man in the world. He can
work better, think better, even play better – and be more of a credit to
his community and his government.”</p>
<p><strong>executive #1</strong>: What the hell is this?!</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: Is this an actual movie?!</p>
<p><strong>executive #1</strong>: It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: It’s fuckin’ ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>feldman</strong>: Wait a minute. That guy in the dress – he’s
the one I met with today! This must be a big PUT-ON! It’s probably
another one of Billy Wellman’s practical jokes!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Georgie, what happened?! I thought “Glen Or
Glenda” was opening next week! Where’s the ads?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: “Where’s the ads”?! The ads are in Alabama,
Indiana, and Missouri! You schmuck, it ain’t gonna play L.A.!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Why not??</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Because I can’t sell it to save my life!
You made a goddamn feathered fish. Is it an art film, a horror show, a
hygiene flick? Nobody knows! I’m beggin’ people to book it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Maybe it needs special handling.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Screw you, Wood! I even sunk more money
into different titles: “Transvestite” “He Or She?” “I Led Two Lives”… It
DOESN’T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You can’t talk that way about my movie.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: “Your movie”?! I wish it was your movie! I
wish I hadn’t blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I
ever see you again, I’ll kill you!!!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: So guess where I’m going next weekend?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t know. Where?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Mexico! And guess what I’m going to do
there?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I dunno. Lie on the beach?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: WRONG! I’m getting my first series of hormone
shots! And once those babies kick in, they’re gonna remove my organs,
and MAKE ME A WOMAN!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Jesus! Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Yes! I’ve dreamed of it for years, but your
movie made me realize I’ve got to take action. GOODBYE, PENIS!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ssh! Will you keep it down?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: My God, look at that guy. He’s a mountain!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like him!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: And once I’m a woman, Jean-Claude and I are
getting married –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ssh! He’s so big! He’s a monster! Can you
imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mr. Johnson, over here!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Glad you could fit me in your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Da pleasure be mine.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Could we moovf to table?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, of course!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So, Mr. Johnson –</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Tor!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an
actor?</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Mm, not good-lookink enough.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I think you’re quite handsome.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: No. With hair, yah. But I must shave head for
wrestlink. It scare da crowds. Dey like that.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, I think you’d be a sensation in
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf
too much accent.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Nah, that doesn’t matter! It’s a visual
medium.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Tor, what can I get ya?</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I’ll haf eight beers.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uhh, I’ll have just one.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: And more nuts!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So anyway, I’ve got this new script, “Bride Of
The Atom,” and there’s a part you’re ideal for: “Lobo.” He’s tough. A
brute. But he has a heart – and at the end he saves the girl.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I like. When do movie shoot?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hopefully, very soon. I’m just awaiting the
final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wood Productions…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela?!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie… my friend.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, what happened?!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I didn’t feel well…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Let me take you to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: No hospital. Just take me to the couch…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Should I call a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Nah. This happens all the time…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Is there anything I can get you? Water? A
blanket?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Goulash.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t know how to make goulash.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s in the needle?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Morphine, with a demerol chaser. Eddie, I’m so
broke. I don’t know what I’m gonna do…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll do something.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m no good.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, it’s just one man’s opinion!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela needs a job… I can’t even get a film going…
But of course I can’t – I made the worst movie of all time.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: All I wanna do is tell stories. The things I
find interesting…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Well maybe you’re not studio kind of
material. Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The movie is called “Bride Of The Atom”…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: …It will star Bela Lugosi. Each of you would put
up $20,000…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes, that’s right. The Bela Lugosi. He’s still
alive. Huh? Is he available Friday night? Gee, I suppose so… Why?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Greetings. I am the Count.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: “Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of
Adventure.” Audience laughs. Applause. “Say, that’s a funny place to
sleep.”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “It is my home.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: “Oh, tract housing, huh?” Laugh. “You need a new
real estate agent.”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Beg to differ. This casket incarpratates, er,
inporporates –”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No Bela, that’s “incorporates.” Look, just say
“This casket has…”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Ach! How do they expect a Hungarian to
pronounce this dialogue? This live television is madness!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Five minutes, Mr. Lugosi.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: And then what’s gonna happen?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: In 1960, the automobile will have
retractable wings, so it can fly.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Sounds like a heck of a way to beat
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: By 1970, Man will have colonized Mars.
Millions of people will live there.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wow! Ain’t that something.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Greetings. I am the Count.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of
Adventure.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Say, that’s a funny place to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: It is my home.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Oh, tract housing, huh? I guess I shouldn’t
complain about my duplex in Burbank. What a dump. Some places have a
Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy shower. I still don’t know where to
hang the towels!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Uh, beg to differ.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: “Beg to differ?!” Hey, I’m talkin’ about my
duplex in Burbank!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Uh, Greetings. I am the Count…</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: I told you we should’ve gotten Karloff.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, don’t worry. You’re better than all this
crap.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I never said I could ad-lib…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Forget about it. We’ll make our new movie, and
you’ll be a star again.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Mr. Lugosi! It is an unparalleled
privilege to meet you. Allow me to introduce myself… I am CRISWELL!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: It’s a pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ah, cheer up! Don’t lose heart over what
happened tonight. I predict that your next project will be an
outstanding success!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: And who may you be?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Edward Wood, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ah. The director of “Glen Or Glenda.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: H-how’d you know?!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I’m Criswell. I know all.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Bring me two more Beefeater martinis.
Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar’s a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and
King are chablis – hey Bela, would you like a wine?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: No. I never drink – wine.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey Cris, how’d you know we’d be living on Mars
by 1970? How’d you know it wouldn’t be 1975, or even 1980?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I guessed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I made it up. It’s horseshit!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: There’s no such thing as a psychic. People
believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s that easy?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Eddie, we’re in show biz! It’s all about
razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will
swallow anything.</p>
<p><strong>conservative man</strong>: Excuse me. We’re here for the Wood
party.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Ah, that would be in the Venetian Room,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We’re gonna have the most terrifying monster
ever seen on film! A ghastly creature created from an atomic
mutation!</p>
<p><strong>backer’s wife</strong>: I don’t like scary movies. I go more
for ones with love stories.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well that’s what this movie is… a heartbreaking
romance! It’s about a young reporter, Janet Lawton, in love with a young
cop, Dick Craig.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you think you’re doin’?!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: These shoes are itchy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You can’t sit! You gotta walk around, with good
posture. You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they’ll
never invest in our movie.</p>
<p><strong>amazed backer</strong>: Bernie, get a load of this guy!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Biceps 22! Chest 62! Stomach 54!</p>
<p><strong>amazed backer</strong>: Whew! You’re quite a specimen. And
you’re gonna be in the picture?</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Yes. I play Lobo!</p>
<p><strong>hick backer</strong>: Mr. Lugosi, I can’t believe I’m meeting
you in person. This is one of the most exciting moments of my life.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Thank you. And you are?</p>
<p><strong>hick backer</strong>: Charlie Johnson! I manufacture
toothpaste tubes.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I predict “Bride Of The Atom” will be the
biggest moneymaker of all time!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And this is lovely starlet Dolores Fuller, who
will play Janet Lawton.</p>
<p><strong>southern backer</strong>: And how much will this picture
cost?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: In a normal studio it would be half-a-million,
with all their wasteful overhead and fancy offices. But because we’re
more efficient, we can bring it in for seventy grand!</p>
<p><strong>southern backer</strong>: Hmm. Well I’ll consider it…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Goodbye! Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: So how’d we do?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We didn’t make a dime.</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: That’s twenty-five cents, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I gave all my money to the babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, the landlord called again. He wants his
money.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tell him “Bride” is in pre- production.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, the landlord doesn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s the problem! Nobody cares about my movie!
I’m tryin’ so hard, I don’t know what else to do!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Don’t get angry at me. Maybe you just need
a day job.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dolores, don’t you understand? I’m a director
now! I made “Glen Or Glenda.” Directing is my day job.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: All I know is, ever since “Glen Or Glenda,”
all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Uh, yoo-hoo. Excuse me! Sorry to
interrupt, but I got some big news.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Well my cousin Fred met this dame from
back East. She’s from “old money,” and he thinks she’s loaded. And
here’s the kicker: She’s very interested in the picture business!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Pleased to meet you. I’m Loretta King.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I understand you just moved here?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Water, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No! No water! NO LIQUIDS! I’m terribly
allergic to them!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be
interested in investing in a motion picture.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Perhaps a small amount of money. How much
do one of your motion pictures cost?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: For this one, we need $60,000.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That’s all?? That seems very reasonable for
an entire picture.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Perhaps you’d like to look at the photoplay.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh my, this is very interesting. Say… do
you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these
parts?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, of course!! There’s a couple characters
you’d be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file
clerk!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hmm. Those sound kind of small. Oh, here’s
one that looks good: Janet Lawton. I’d sure like to play her.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: J-Janet Lawton???</p>
<p><strong>loretia</strong>: Yes, Janet Layton is clearly the part to
play. She’s got some real meaty scenes! Can’t you just see me in that
part??</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uh… yeah… You’d be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It was the only way I could get the movie
made!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Who do you think’s been paying the rent?!
Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m sorry! What did you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I wanted you to say, “No! I wrote the part
for my girlfriend Dolores.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But there’s plenty of other parts.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Like what?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The secretary. Or the file clerk.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is gonna be Bela’s laboratory, so it should
be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies. I want
beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that
buzzes!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: You mean a Tesla coil?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Edvard! I haf question ’bout script. My vife
Greta, she read. And she no like.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Really? Was the third act too intense?</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo
don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But Tor, it’s a starring part! You’re second
billed.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he
no talk.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tor, dialogue is overrated. You look at the
classic film actors, who are they? Fairbanks. Chaplin. They didn’t talk!
They did it all with their face.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: But Greta say –</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Eddie, which dress do you like better?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t know. Hey Bill, which dress is better
for you, the green or the red one?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: Which one is the red one?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: I mean I can’t see the difference.
I’m color-blind. But I like the dark gray one.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, you’re Dr. Eric Vornoff. You’re upset.
You’ve worked so hard on this experisent, and you don’t want to see it
fail. No, you’re not that upset. You want to keep moving. You wanna
cross the room. Okay, CUT! BEAUTIFUL! PRINT IT!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Alright, let’s go immediately to Scene 52. Tor,
are you in place?</p>
<p><strong>tor’s voice</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, CUE RAINSTORM!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And roll camera! ACTION!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, you’re Lobo. You’re upset. You’ve worked
so hard helping Dr. Vornoff on this experiment, and you don’t want to
see it fail. No, you’re not that upset. You want to keep moving. You
wanna cross the room. Okay, CUT! PERFECT! PRINT IT!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: At Universal, they shot two scenes a day.
Eddie can knock off twenty or thirty! He’s incredible.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: Hey Ed, shouldn’t we do another
take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, it’s fine. It’s real! In actuality, Lobo
would struggle with that problem every day.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wow, this lab looks great. Except why is there a
stove and refrigerator?</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: We couldn’t afford any more props. If it
seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Nah, it’ll work. Where’s Bela?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Mmph? Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’re shooting “Bride Of The Atom.” Scene
85.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’ll be sitting on the right.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I’m not getting near that goddamn thing. One
of those burned me on “The Return Of Chandu.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay. Then you’ll be sitting on the left.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Here’s the scene. Loretta, you’re in a trance.
You glide in and get on the operating table. Now Tor, you’re supposed to
tie her down. But you have an angora fetish… and when you rub that
swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Okey-dokey.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Dear, you are a woman of super strength and
beauty. A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty – shit!” Damn! Eddie, I’m
sorry I can’t remember all this. I’m an old man. It’s too long.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s fine, Bela. We’re still rolling. Just say
“Dear, you’re lovely.”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Dear, you’re lovely.” “Strap her to the
table.”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Do as I command you!”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “I’ll teach you to disobey me!”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And, CUT!!! Impeccable!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I love being movie star!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Ow. Not so hard, Tor.</p>
<p><strong>surly stage manager</strong>: Hey, Wood. Your check
bounced.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, I’ll get you the money later.</p>
<p><strong>surly stage manager</strong>: No. I need it NOW.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sorry to bother you while we’re shooting, but
the guy who owns the stage needs his money.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Well then you should pay him, shouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I kinda need it now.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What are you looking at me like that for? I
already gave you my three hundred.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What other sixty-thousand?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The other sixty-thousand you said you’d give
me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You misunderstood. I gave you everything I
have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: So is Dolores coming?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I can’t imagine why. I wouldn’t put up with a
boyfriend who sold me out for three-hundred dollars…!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: …lemme tell you, you can’t lose. It’s scary! And
if you don’t like that, it’s romantic! Bela Lugosi portrays Dr. Vornoff,
and lovely ingenue Loretta King is reporter Janet Lawton.</p>
<p><strong>potential backer</strong>: Hmm. Lugosi looks pretty old.
Which role is Vampira playing?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Vampira…? Why do you ask??</p>
<p><strong>potential backer</strong>: Well I see her standing over
there.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well… she’s playing – Could you excuse me one
moment??</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me, Miss Vampira?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You don’t know me, but my name is Ed Wood. I’m a
film producer. I’m currently in production on a science-fiction piece,
with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson. And I saw you here,
and I thought: Kismet!</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: I don’t understand. Do you want my
autograph?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. I think my film is perfect for you.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: You want me to show it on my TV program?
Well I got nothing to do with that. You should call up the station
manager at Channel Seven –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! I don’t want you to show the movie, I want
you to be in it! See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but
then after three days we got shut down. So we’re having a backers party,
to raise some more money. Perhaps you’d like to come next door and meet
some of the backers…?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Uh, look, I’m with some friends, and we’re
about to eat –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Please! It’ll only take a minute. You can have
some hors d’oeuvres, and meet my backers! There’s a really nice dentist
from Oxnard…</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Look buddy, I’m a big star. I’ve got real
offers from real studios. I don’t need to blow some dentist for a part.
So forget it!</p>
<p><strong>backer</strong>: I’m getting a bad feeling about this. Let’s
get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Where are you guys going?! You can’t leave!</p>
<p><strong>backer</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Wood.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You can’t go! You haven’t seen the
storyboards!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Fine! SCREW YOU! If you don’t have the balls to
roll the dice, then I don’t want your stinking money!!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Please, come back!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Goddamn landlord.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I told you this was gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Maybe if you’d come to the backers party, I
would’ve gotten the money.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: That’s moronic. Why would a bit player
impress a backer?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, how many times can I say I’m sorry? I blew
it! I thought she was rich.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: That’s a good reason to dump your
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I didn’t dump you! Get it through your skull – I
just recast the part!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You’re a fuckin’ mess.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we’re
gonna stay.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I’m going to my mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Does she have room for me?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I think you should stay with one of your
friends.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, I don’t know what I’m doin’ anymore…</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Stop worrying. This is going to raise your
spirits.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Thou eternal sun, who has covered the
consciousness with thy golden disc, do thou remove the veil so that I
may see the truth within?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: This is the Philosophical Research Society. A
refuge for free thinkers. I’ve been coming here for twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: …for the truth which is within thee is
within me. And I am Truth.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Most people in this country, they know
nothing, about Eastern mysticism. They are afraid of it. But I am
open-minded. It gives me hope.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: We have the wisdom to govern and the
divine right to inherit the earth in good condition. We have the power
to build worlds.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Was I wrong to cast Loretta?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.
Just keep looking forward.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But was it a bad decision? At the time, I
thought her money would save the movie.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, you screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: In life, the decisions that haunt you are the
ones where you just don’t know… where right or wrong will never be
answered. Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me. The government wanted
me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices,
a big home… I’d be treated like a king.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So why didn’t you do it?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I didn’t know if it was a trick. They might
arrest me and throw me in a gulag. I am Hungary’s most famous emigrant.
they’d use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Correct. So instead, I stayed here, waiting
for my comeback. Always hoping… the next film, the next film… that would
be the one.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Your next film. That will be the one.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: …and then Dr. Vornoff falls in the pit, and his
own octopus attacks and eats him! The End.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. We shot ten minutes of the movie, and now
we’re looking for completion funds.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Movies are very popular. You could make a lot of
money.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well… you get “Executive Producer” credit.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mr. McCoy, how can I make you happy?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But the story ends with Dr. Vornoff falling in
the pit –</p>
<p><strong>wrestling coach</strong>: Tor, you got a phone call!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Heh? NOW?</p>
<p><strong>wrestling coach</strong>: They said it was an emergency!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Hallo?</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: Tor, this is Ed! Glad I could find you!
I got the money, and we resume shooting tomorrow morning!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: But I’m in Utah.</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: Then you’ll have to drive all night! I’m
counting on you, big guy. Breakfast is at seven.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: This is unbelievable! I woulda bet a
million bucks that Ed wouldn’t finish this picture.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman bill</strong>: It ain’t finished yet. Anything
could happen.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Uh-oh. Stay out of scratching distance.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Honey, you made it! I wasn’t sure you got my
message.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Of course I’m here. Today is the file
clerk’s big scene.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I see the usual gang of misfits and dope
addicts are here. Say, who’s the lug?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: “Now Janet, I want you straying away – oops –
staying away from the old Willows Place.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s Tony McCoy. He’s playing Lieutenant Dick
Craig.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Oh really? How much money did he put
up?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Wood Productions. The mark of quality.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey, the movie’s getting made. That’s the main
thing.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Hey Harry – long time no see.</p>
<p><strong>make-up man harry</strong>: Hi Dolores…</p>
<p><strong>loreta</strong>: Oh, you’re Dolores?! I’ve heard so much
about you! I’m Loretta King. Here, take the chair.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Don’t be silly – let Harry finish. You
still need more work.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No, I’m done. All I needed was a
touch-up.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Mm, that mole still shows.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ladies! You both look fine. Why don’t we talk
about the scene? Okay. Janet Lawton has discovered that Dr. Vornoff
bought the old Willows estate. So now she wants to prove that all the
monster stories are true.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, what’s my motivation?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh. Er… well you’re the file clerk. You’re
hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: But what’s our relationship? Are we good
friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.
Quit kidding around.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Of course it was.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: My pleasure. I’m always happy to assist in
a little larceny.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: My head is cold.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You know how much this car cost me?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: ONE DOLLAR! Miss Mae West herself sold it
to me. She said, Cris, you belong in a pink Cadillac!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Incidentally, you promise you’re not going
to scratch my car…?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I told you, the octopus is made of rubber. This
is a piece o’ cake.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Ed, you said you were getting
permission.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uh, I couldn’t reach the guy… he was in meetings
all day. But this’ll be great, I promise!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I’m no good at climbink.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I’m good at bashink!!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Hey, keep it down. My publicist will
throttle me if we get caught.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh. I thought they kept this open.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Lobo will fix!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: This place gives se the creeps. Let’s
get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Not so fast. First we have to get it down.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: You’re sure this is gonna work?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: You’re sure???</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Oh my God. We killed him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tor! Are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Bedder than wrestlink!</p>
<p><strong>angry voice</strong>: Hey! What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Thank God Tor broke the fence.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: “Now Janet, I want you staying away from the
old Willows Place.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You don’t understand! The octopus is supposed to
live in a lake!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: This is kind of a stream–</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: NO! It has to be UNDERWATER!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, I’m so tired… I don’t know if I can
handle a night shoot…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Nonsense! You look great – Look, uh, why don’t
you lie down and take a little nap? We’ll film around you for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Thanks, buddy…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey. This is looking good! Paul, where’s the
octopus motor?</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: What octopus motor?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know, to make the legs move –</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Hey, don’t blame me! You didn’t say
anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Let’s shoot this fucker! Where do I go?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’ll be fighting with the octopus.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Out there?! What happened to the stream?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This’ll look a lot better. We have to match the
stock footage of the octopus underwater.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Oh, for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Goddamn, it’s cold!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Once you’re in it, it warms up.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Fuck you! You come out here. Hey, toss me that
J.D.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Okay! How do we turn this thing on?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you
wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it’s
killing you.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Do you know I turned down “Frankenstein”?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: After I did “Dracula,” the studio offered me
“Frankenstein”! But I turned it down, the part wasn’t sexy enough. It
was too degrading for a big star like me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, I’ve got twenty-five scenes to shoot
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Don’t let me slow you down.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Alright! Let’s put it on film.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And CUT!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: C’mon! Just one more day! Just have some coffee,
you’ll feel better!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Mr. Wood, I only got one hour of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah? Well I got no sleep, and I feel great!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela. I just wanna thank you again for last
night.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: That’s fine, Eddie. All in the line of
duty.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I
appreciate what you’ve done for me. A great man like you shouldn’t have
to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Well, there aren’t too many other fellas I’d
do it for…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I wrote something special for you. I got to
thinking about all the sacrifices you’ve made… and so I wrote you a new
final speech.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, this is quite a scene.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I know it’s a lot to give you at the last
second.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: These lines – I’ll have no problem
remembering.</p>
<p><strong>strowski</strong>: “Our government wants you to return… to
continue your experiments there. Where you can have everything at your
disposal.”</p>
<p><strong>strowski</strong>: “Yes, the authorities have learned how
correct your findings were. So I am here – sent to bring you home.”</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Home. I have no home. Hunted… despised…
living like an animal – the jungle is my home! But I will show the world
that I can be its master. I shall perfect my own race of people – a race
of atomic supermen that will conquer the world!”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Cut. It’s a wrap.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: So you sleep in coffins?!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Yes. There is nothing more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I can’t believe this! I sleep in
coffins!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: YES! My father ran a mortuary – it’s an
old habit!</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend #1</strong>: “McCoy Meat Packing”? Are you sure
there’s a party here?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Yeah, I got this invitation. It’s a “Bride
Of The Atom” party, whatever that means.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: “Glen Or Glenda,” now that was a hell of
a picture.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, this new one’s gonna be a hundred
times better.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Go, baby, go!</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: I don’t believe it. It’s him!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You people are INSANE! Take a look around –
you’re all FREAKS!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You’re wasting your lives making SHIT!
Nobody cares! These movies are TERRIBLE! I can’t take it any longer!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dolores, wait!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed, it’s over. I need a normal life.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Did you really mean those things you said..?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I’m tired of living on the fringe.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But you used to say –</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Ed… I just stuck it out so you could finish
your movie. Now that it’s done, so am I.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, I was just doin’ a little work…</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Edvard, you come!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I’m so happy you visit. Meet my family! Greta,
Karl, and Connie!</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Pass the meatballs.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: This strudel is delicious, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Hey! You’re not eatink.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uh, I don’t have much of an appetite lately.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me
– I’m da happiest guy I know!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’d be happy too, if I had such a great
family.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Don’t worry. You just haven’t met right woman
yet. Oopsy. That cabbage goes right through me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Greta, your husband is a terrific actor. You
should come down and visit the set.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, it’s really no problem at all!</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: I do not approve of what you do with my
husband Tor. He is not a monster. These horror pictures are
humiliating.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Look, it happened again!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tor, I should be getting home.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Nonsense! You must try our hot glug.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever
see? No! Many duds, before I find her.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But I thought me and Dolores had something.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Forget her! Move on. A good lookink boy like
you as you can have any girl you wish.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: God, we need some better jokes on this
show.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Vampira, you got a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: At this hour? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: Vampira! Hi, this is Ed Wood.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: Ed Wood! You came to my party. I
directed “Bride Of The Atom”!</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Oh. Yeah. You.</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime
you’d like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: You mean like a date? I thought you were a
fag.</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: ME?! No, uh, I’m just a
transvestite.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Isn’t that the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: No, no! I like girls. So how ’bout
Friday?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but
you’re just not my type. But keep in touch. Let me know when your movie
opens.</p>
<p><strong>ed’s voice</strong>: Excuse me. Is that angora?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Why… yes.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t you think angora has a tactile sensuality
lacking in all other clothing?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I suppose. It’s very expensive.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s made from specially-bred rabbits that live
in the Himalayas.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What are you, an angora wholesaler?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, I work in pictures. I’m a
director-actor-writer-producer.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Ah, c’mon! Nobody does all that.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Two people do. Orson Welles and me.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know, you’re a very attractive girl.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: My goodness, you’re embarrassing me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You shouldn’t be embarrassed by the truth. Mind
if I order some hotcakes…?</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: So who’s the surprise for?</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: I dunno. Ed was real mysterious. All
he’d say was it’s a surprise party.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Isn’t that like him! And isn’t that like
us – that we show up anyway.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Excuse me. We’re here for the Wood
party.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: They’ve rented Stage 12. Drive straight
back.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: So what are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Nobody knows. But there’s a lotta booze.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me! Could everyone please quiet down?
First of all, I want to thank you, all my good friends, for being here
tonight. And second, if you’re wondering what the big surprise is… well,
TONIGHT I’M GETTING MARRIED!!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Everybody, this is Norma!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Who the fuck is she??</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I never heard of her.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And Bela, I want you to be the best man!</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: …Norma, do you promise to love, honor, and
cherish…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I didn’t even know he had a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: I hear she’s an actress who gave him
money.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nah, I heard she’s his childhood sweetheart
from Poughkeepsie.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I predict it’s Dolores in a mask.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: …in sickness and in health, till death do
you part?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Then I now pronounce you man and wife.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Norma, this is Bela – Bela, this is Norma.
Norma, this is Tor – Tor, this is Norma. Norma, this is Paul Paul, this
is Norma.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: So how long have you known Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Since Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Edward, are you sure you know what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. It seems a little crazy, but sometimes you
just know. She’s perfect for me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oop, that’s our cue! Honey, we gotta go.
GOODBYE,</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Eddie, I’m just a small-town girl. I’ve never
done this before.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll teach you.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Be understanding. I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What the heck is THIS?!!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Honey, I have a little secret to share with
you.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Stay away from me! You’re perverted!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Please, be compassionate. I’m your husband!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: No you’re not! This marriage was never
consummated. I’m getting an annulment!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, let me in! Bela, it’s Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Why are you here??</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Shit! Bela, what’s with the gun?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Why aren’t you on your honeymoon? Where’s
Myrna?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Norma. She changed her mind. She doesn’t wanna
marry me. Can you put down the gun?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I was thinking about killing myself.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Jesus Christ, what an evening. What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, I received a letter from the
government. They’re cutting off my unemployment. That’s all I’ve got.
Without it, I can’t pay the rent…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t you have any savings?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I’m obsolete. I have nothing to live for.
Tonight, I should die. And you should come with me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Buddy, I don’t know if that’s such a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: It’ll be wonderful. We’ll be at peace. In the
afterlife, you don’t have to worry about finding work.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, I’m on your side. C’mon, give me the gun…
If you give me the gun, I’ll make you a drink. What are you
drinking?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Formaldehyde.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Straight up or on the rocks?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I’m sorry, Eddie. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t worry. Everything’s gonna be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: My goodness, you gave me the willies. You
look like that Dracula guy.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: My name is Bela Lugosi. I wish to commit
myself.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: For what reason?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I have been a drug addict for twenty years. I
need help…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Hello. You’re sleeping in a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I got married last night.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The marriage already ended.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh. My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What are you making?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Booties for my father. He gets cold in this
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How long’s he been here?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: This is my thirteenth pair.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me. Doctor? I’m with Mr. Lugosi. How is
he?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well… there’s a lot of junk in his system
for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to
kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Will he be okay?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We’ll do our best.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi, Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Hi, Ed. Boy, he’s got a lot of visitors
today.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He does?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s going on here?! Excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Everybody out! This is a hospital! Get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Isn’t it wonderful? After all these years, the
press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, they’re parasites! They just want to
exploit you.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Fine. Let them! There is no such thing as bad
press. A man from New York even said he’s putting me on the front page!
First celebrity to ever check into rehab. When I get out of here, I will
be healthy. Strong! I will be primed for my comeback!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh, it’s you again.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You look beat.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I am. How’s your father?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He’s better. Thank you for asking. How’s your
friend?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Not good…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well, I made him some booties to cheer him
up. They’re black – to match his cape.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Would you maybe like to get a coffee..?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the
Screen Actors Guild.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No. They say his eligibility ran out years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, he doesn’t have any money… but I’ll give
you everything I’ve got. I have a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That won’t even begin to cover it. He’s
going to have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela, wake up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’ve got some good news. The doctor says you’re
all better. You can come home.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Really? I don’t feel so great.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, you look good. And the tests came back fine.
C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are
we gonna make another picture?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Soon, Bela… Soon.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Please, I just need it for one afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>old manager</strong>: Ed, if I cut a deal for you, I gotta
cut one for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is different! It’ll mean so much to me. All
I need is a camera and a tripod. No lights, no sound. Nothin’ fancy.</p>
<p><strong>old manager</strong>: And that’s it?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And one roll of film.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: This is so exciting. Another production!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: So Eddie, don’t we need a sound crew?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, this is just the second unit. We’ll do the
main footage later.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Oh. So what is the scene about?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uh… you’re a very important and respected man.
You’re leaving your house… and you’re in a hurry to a big social
event.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Okay. But what if I’m not in too big a hurry?
What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life? To
smell a flower?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s great. Let’s do a take.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, roll camera! Rolling. Scene One, Take One!
And… ACTION!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And, cut…</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, how was I?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Good. Now what about my close up?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh, flowers! I didn’t know you were so
traditional.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I just picked them up on the way over…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: They’re very nice. Let me get my coat.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: So have you always lived in L.A.?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. I’m from back east. You know, All-American
small town… everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked
for the post office…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Did you find it boring?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Nah, ’cause I had my comic books. And I read
pulp magazines. And I listened to the radio dramas…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh. I loved those shows! “Inner Sanctum”…
“The Shadow” –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah! Don’t forget “Mercury Theatre”… And then
every Saturday, I’d go to the little movie theater down the street. I
even started ushering there.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You’re not gonna believe the first picture I
ever saw. Your friend’s.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: “Dracula.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s INCREDIBLE! That’s the first picture I
ever saw!!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That is incredible! You know, I had to sleep
with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.
But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: A few years ago, I actually saw him do
“Dracula” live. I thought he was much scarier in person.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Kathy, I’m about to tell you something I’ve
never told any girl on a first date. But I think it’s important that you
know. I like to wear women’s clothes.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I like to wear women’s clothes: Panties,
brassieres, sweaters, pumps… it’s just something I do. And I can’t
believe I’m telling you, but I really like you, and I don’t want it
getting in the way down the road.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Does this mean you don’t like sex with
girls?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! I love sex with girls.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, don’t worry, I moved on. I was just calling
to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, “Bride
Of The Monster.”</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Didn’t you just make one called “Bride Of
The Atom”?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s the same film. But the distributor wanted a
punchier title. C’mon! It’s gonna be a big event – we’re going all out!
Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming. You’ll have fun!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: My eyes are killink me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t worry. We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, where are we? We passed that carwash
twenty minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I predict we’re lost.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Hey! You wanna watch the hands??</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Has anyone ever been to Downey?</p>
<p><strong>theater manager</strong>: Children, if you don’t calm down,
there won’t be the entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>angry kid</strong>: It was supposed to start an hour ago!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: My eyes are burnink.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Hey look! There’s the theater.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Where? I can’t see nothink!</p>
<p><strong>frantic usher</strong>: Thank God, you’re here! They’re
tearing the place apart!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>frantic usher</strong>: C’mon! This way!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’ve never been to a premiere before.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wow. Go knock ’em dead!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: It’s the blind leading the blind!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Dis is a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: It’s show biz.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: I think they’re getting ready to burn this
place down.</p>
<p><strong>high school punk</strong>: Hey Vampira, how ’bout a little
love?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>theater manager</strong>: Children, please! Be calm!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: C’mon! We’re getting the hell out of here!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We’re escaping!</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: We’re gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Now that was a premiere.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Last night was quite a romp.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Did you see that kid grab Vampira’s tits?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a
girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, she’s really somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: I know none of my wives would’ve.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Eddie, I want to thank you. These last few
days have been a good time.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I just wish you coulda seen the movie.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: No problem. I know it by heart…</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: “Home. I have no home. Hunted… despised…
living like an animal – the jungle is my home! But I will show the world
that I can be its master. I shall perfect my own race of people… a race
of atomic supermen that will conquer the world!”</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Mr. Lugosi, could I have your
autograph?</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Boy, that was incredible. You’re just as
good an actor as you always were.</p>
<p><strong>bela</strong>: Better. I’m seventy-four, but I don’t know it.
If the brain is young, then the spirit is still vigorous… like a young
man.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Thanks. It’s actually the only thing I know how
to make. Hey, can you grab that strainer?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ugh! Always at the wrong time. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bela died.</p>
<p><strong>photographer #1</strong>: Whose crazy idea was it to bury him
in the cape?</p>
<p><strong>photographer #2</strong>: I heard it was in the will. It was
how he wanted to be remembered.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do you want me to run it again?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’d seen him in a coffin so many times, I
expected him to jump out…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Ed, you’ve got to snap out of this. Bela’s
dead – you’re not!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I might as well be. I made shitty movies that
nobody wanted to see. I blew it. All he wanted was a comeback… that last
glory…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well you tried –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I was a fuckin’ HACK! I let people recut the
movies, cast their relatives… I let Bela down…</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Mr. Wood?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hruphh…?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your
landlord. Could you please open up?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and
final rent check.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m real sorry. My stockbroker must have
transferred the wrong account… C’mon in, I’ll write you another one.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Hmm, so you’re in the picture
business?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You could say that –</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: I’m interested in the picture business. My
associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films,
on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don’t have enough money.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Raising money is tough.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Oh! Our church has the money for one film.
We just don’t have it for all twelve…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay – you know what you do? You produce a film
in a commercially proven genre. And after it’s a hit, you take the
profits from that, and make the twelve Apostles’ movies.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Would that work?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Absolutely! You see this script..?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: “Graverobbers From Outer Space”! It’s money in
the bank.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Graverobbers from what??</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: From outer space! It’s science- fiction. Very
big with the kids! If you make this picture, you’ll have enough money to
finance a HUNDRED religious films! And pay my back rent from the
profits.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: I don’t know… this is all a lot to
absorb.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s a guaranteed blockbuster!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Um, I understand that this science
friction is popular – but don’t the big hits always have big stars?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, well we’ve GOT a big star! Bela
Lugosi!!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Lugosi??! Didn’t be pass on?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes, but I’ve got the last footage he ever
shot!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Just, it doesn’t look like very much.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s plenty! It’s the acorn that will grow a
great oak. I’ll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we’ll
release it as “Bela Lugosi’s Final Film”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bunny! We’re making another film! Yeah – I got
the Baptist Church of Beverly Hills to put up the cash!</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes
outside.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Great! Bring ’em in! Bunny, I gotta run.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Too tall… too short… And this guy doesn’t work
at all.</p>
<p><strong>paul marco</strong>: Well I was thinkin’ like, when Bela
played “Fu Manchu.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That was Karloff. Paul, you gotta try harder. I
don’t want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the
quality.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And by the way, keep Sunday free. The producers
want all of us to get baptized.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know, when you rewrite a script, it just
gets better and better!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Do you want your buttons on the left or the
right?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The left. It’s more natural. Hey, I’ve got a
scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb. What would that be made
of?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Uh, atomic energy?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. They’re beyond that! They’re smarter than
the humans. What’s more advanced?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Dynamite –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, BIGGER! What’s the biggest energy??</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: The sun.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes! BINGO! Solar energy! Oh that’s gonna seem
so scientific. This movie’s gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film. No
compromises.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh my God. Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Those assholes.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: The poor girl’s out of a job.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah… I should give her a call.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m really sorry…</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: It’s terrible. People won’t even return my
calls. It’s like I don’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I know what that’s like. Anyway, I brought a
copy of the script. You would play the “Ghoul’s Wife.”</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: The Ghoul’s Wife?! God, I can’t believe I’m
doing this…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You should feel lucky. Ed’s the only guy in
town who doesn’t pass judgment on people.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hell, if I did, I wouldn’t have any friends.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Look… would it be possible to make the
“Ghoul’s Wife” a little less prominent, so people won’t really notice me
in the movie?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You don’t wanna be noticed?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Exactly. Hey, how ’bout this – what if I
don’t have any lines? I’ll do the part mute!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Look, it’s Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who’s Dr. Tom?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: My chiropractor!</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: Kathy, how are you?! You’re looking in
alignment today.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Actually, my neck’s a little funny.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wait a second. Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s uncanny.</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: What’s uncanny?</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: He look nutink like Bela!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: He’s kinds got his ears.</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: You’re stupid!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No, cover up his face.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Ah! Now I see it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: “I want to suck your blood!”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: SHHH! We want these Baptists to like us.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Brothers and Sisters, we’ve reached
a special part of the service. The baptism of our new members! If the
congregation will oblige, we’d like to adjourn and reconvene at Emma
DuBois’s back yard.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: Why couldn’t we do this in the church?</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: Because “Brother Tor� couldn’t fit in the
sacred tub.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: …Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ
as your savior?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: …Do you reject Satan and all his
works?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: …Do you repent for all your
sins?</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Oh my God, I dropped him –</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: I don’t think he’s coming up!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Lord no! The man’s drowning!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What do we do?!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Help! HELP!!!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Dear Jesus, please forgive us!</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: Tor make good joke!</p>
<p><strong>vampira</strong>: This can’t be the right address…</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: I am so happy! Finally I am star wit dialogue!
I memorized every wordt. Eddie will be so proud!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood, we
have a few questions –</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: The script refers on numerous
occasions to graverobbing. Now we find the concept of digging up
consecrated ground highly offensive. It’s blasphemy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What are you talking about?! It’s the premise of
the movie. It’s even the title, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Mr. Wood!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Yes, about that title, it strikes us as
very inflammatory. Why don’t we change it to “Plan Nine From Outer
Space”?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And, ACTION!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “Just left. The morgue wagon oughta be along
most any time.”</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: “You get statement frumk vitnesses?”</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “Yeah, but they’re pretty scared.”</p>
<p><strong>tor</strong>: “Findink mess like dis oughta make anyone
frightened. Have one of da boyz take dem back to town. You take
jarge.”</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What’d you give him all the lines for??
He’s unintelligible!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won’t talk.
Ihad to give somebody the dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: That’s not an answer.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: See, no talking. Isn’t he good?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Isn’t it wonderful? Bela lives!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Doesn’t this strike you as a bit
morbid?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, he would’ve loved it! Bela’s returned from
the grave – like Dracula.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And PERFECT. CUT!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: “Perfect”? Mr. Wood, do you know anything
about the art of film production?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I like to think so.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: That cardboard headstone tipped over. This
graveyard is obviously phony!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: People won’t notice. Filmmaking isn’t about
picky details – it’s about the big picture.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Oh, you wanna talk about the “big
picture”?! How ’bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now
it’s suddenly night???</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: YOU DON’T KNOW ANYTHING! Haven’t you ever heard
of “suspension of disbelief”?!</p>
<p><strong>strapping young man</strong>: Reverend, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: This is our choir director. He’s
gonna play the young hero.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Are you IN5ANE? I’m the director! I make the
casting decisions around here!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: I thought this was a group
effort.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: They’re driving me crazy! These Baptists are
stupid, stupid, STUPID!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mmm. I need to calm… Take deep breaths… Ohh,
it’s so smooth…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, everyone! Let’s set up for Scene 112! Move
the crypt stage left and get ready with Tor’s make-up effect.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Mr. Wood? What do you think you’re
doing?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m directing.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Not like THAT, you’re not!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: Remove that get-up immediately. You
shame our Lord.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s it. I give up!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Take me to the nearest bar.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Imperial whiskey, straight up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh my God. It’s Orson Welles…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me, Sir…?</p>
<p><strong>orson welles</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Uh, uh, I’m a young filmmaker, and a really big
fan… and I just wanted to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>orson welles</strong>: My pleasure. I’m Orson Welles.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh. Um, I’m Ed Wood! So, what are you working on
now?</p>
<p><strong>orson welles</strong>: Eh, the financing just fell through
for the third time on “Don Quixote.” So I’m trying to finish a promo for
something else. But I can’t find the soundtrack – I think I left it in
Malta.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I can’t believe it. These sound like my
problems!</p>
<p><strong>orson welles</strong>: It’s the damn money men. You never
know who’s a windbag, and who’s got the goods. And then they all think
they’re a director…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ain’t that the truth! I’ve even bad producers
recut my movies –</p>
<p><strong>orson welles</strong>: Ugh, I hate when that happens.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And they always want to cast their buddies – it
doesn’t even matter if they’re right for the part!</p>
<p><strong>orson welles</strong>: Tell me about it. I’m supposed to do a
thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a
Mexican!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?</p>
<p><strong>orson welles</strong>: It is when it works. You know the one
film of mine I can stand to watch? “Kane.” The studio hated it… but they
didn’t get to touch a frame. Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why
spend your life making someone else’s dreams?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mr. Reynolds!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We are gonna finish this film just the way I
want it! Because you can’t compromise an artist’s vision!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lemon</strong>: B-but it’s our money –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And you’re gonna make a bundle. This movie’s
gonna be famous! But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, I want that tank! And I want that
bomb!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: NO! The aliens should look like people.</p>
<p><strong>make-up man harry</strong>: I’m tellin’ ya, aliens are always
green.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Not in my movie, they’re not!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: “What plan will we follow?”</p>
<p><strong>hammy alien</strong>: “Plan Nine.”</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: “Plan Nine…” “Ah yes. Plan Nine deals with
the resurrection of the dead.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Maybe you guys were right. “Plan Nine” is a good
title.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Where’s the cockpit set?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’re standing in it. Alright, bring in the
shower curtain!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: “So what if we develop this solarnite bomb?
We’d be even a stronger nation.”</p>
<p><strong>hammy alien</strong>: “Stronger? You see! You see!! Your
stupid minds! Stupid! STUPID!”</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: “That’s all I’m taking from you.”</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: “Perhaps on your way home, someone will
pass you in the dark, and you will never know it. For they will be from
outer space.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: More fog! More fog!! And CUT! PRINT IT! IT’S A
WRAP!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I can’t get it to go up.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Ed, you’re gonna miss your own premiere.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: C’mon! Let’s just go.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: You are about to see en extraordinary
motion picture. But before it begins, I think we ought to give a hand to
the man without whom we wouldn’t be here tonight… Eddie, take a bow!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Thanks a million. I just wanna say… this film is
for Bela.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is the one. I know I’ll be remembered for
this film.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Ed, I’m so happy for you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Let’s get married.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Huh?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Right now. Let’s drive to Vegas!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: But it’s pouring. And the car top is
stuck!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So? It’s only a five-hour drive. And it’ll
probably clear up, once we hit the desert. Heck, it’ll probably clear up
once we drive around the corner. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>criswell</strong>: My friend, you have just seen the story of
Edward D. Wood, Junior. Stranger than fact… and yet every incident based
on sworn testimony. A man. A life. Can you prove it didn’t happen?</p>
