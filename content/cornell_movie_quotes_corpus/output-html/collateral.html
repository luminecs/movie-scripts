<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You okay? Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, mate. Enjoy</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …it’s always you. Why is everything always
directed at you…?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …everything is not “always about me.” He was
being sarcastic and you goddamn well know it…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …I’m sorry, I didn’t hear it that way…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …oh, bullshit! How about the dig about the
makeover…?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …what do you want me to do, punch the guy out?
I work with him. And you’re perfectly capable of taking care of your
own……</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …well, last I checked, you were sleeping with
me, so unless you wanna start fucking him, I suggest…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, leave-up on him, man…</p>
<p><strong>gang member</strong>: Say what? What you lookin’ at,
bitch?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: How’d you get the chop suey all over the
cab?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I didn’t. The cab got in a fight with a gang of
Chinese Cholos.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: There’s been sprouts by the passenger
door.</p>
<p><strong>addendum</strong>: WILD DIAL FOR ANNIE ACTION while Annie’s
on the cell phone to UNHEARD LEGAL ASSISTANT/TRANSCRIBER…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I need it transcribed…</p>
<p><strong>assistant’s voice</strong>: Off of what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Off the line sheets.</p>
<p><strong>assistant’s voice</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: ’Cause I think it’s him on there. In the gold
Lexus on the cell. If it is, he’s enhanceable, ’cause of priors in the
late ’80’s…</p>
<p><strong>assistant’s voice</strong>: What about tomorrow
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: …no, the transcriptions need to be done by
seven a.m.. Period. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How ya’ doin’? Where to?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Downtown. 312 North Spring Street. Take
Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea. La Brea north to 6th into downtown.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: So you’ll be up late. I’m pulling an
all-nighter, too. Save the tears.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll take 105 east and up the 110. It’s
faster.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: 105 to the 110 is faster.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: 110 turns into a parking lot around</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This late, the 110 is moving, but La Brea north
of the Santa Monica is jammed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: 110 north of the 10 you get people going to
Pasadena and they drive slow.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s why I jump off at Grand. But, hey,
surface streets is cool. That’s what you want, that’s what we do…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Are we taking bets? What if you’re wrong?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Your ride is free.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You got yourself a deal.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Go ahead, say it. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …lucky with the lights.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You weren’t “lucky with the lights.” What you
were was right. I was wrong… …Max.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You mind turning this up?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You like Bach?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I used to play this piece in high school.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Let me guess. Woodwinds?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Viola. I never had the lungs for wind
instruments.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Could’a fooled me, the way you were unloading
into that cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Different instrument… You know, if you’d only
listened to me, we’d be all bogged down in traffic right now, and you
would have made an extra five bucks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah? Keep it. Buy yourself something. Go
wild.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: A gentleman. I thought chivalry was a
necessary casualty of gender politics…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not a big thing, you know…?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How many cabbies get you into an argument to
save you money?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There were two of us. I killed the other guy. I
don’t like competition…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You take pride in…being the best at what you
do…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This? This is temporary. You know. Pays the
bills. I fill in with this. I WILL be the best at what I do, but that’s
something else.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m setting up something…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Like tell me…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …limo company I’m putting together. Island
Limousines. An island on wheels. So I’m part-timing until I get
delivery, Benzes off leases, work up my client lists, staff up, all
that…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You like being a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You psychic?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m starting an 800 hotline. Caught your phone
call. And even if I hadn’t, there’s the dark pinstripe. Elegant, not too
hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top drawer briefcase, that you
live out of, purse looks like a Bodega…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Bottega.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …Bottega. Guy gets in my cab with a machete? I
figure he’s a sushi chef. You? Clarence Darrow.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Not quite. He worked defense. I’m a
prosecutor…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Big case?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You got us here fast…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You never answered my question. You like what
you do?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But not right now…?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I do…like I can’t wait. …I love standing
up in that courtroom. At the same time…I always get this clenched-up
thing the night before the first day…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Clenched-up how…?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think I’m gonna lose. I think I suck. I
think my case sucks. I haven’t prepared enough. My exhibits aren’t in
order. People are gonna figure out that I don’t know what I’m doin’. And
I’ve had this charade going for years. I represent the Department of
Justice of the United States government and my opening statement is
gonna fall flat at the really important point and the jury’s gonna laugh
at me. Then I cry… I don’t throw-up. A lot of people throw-up. I have a
strong stomach. Then I get it together. And rewrite my opening
statement. Work the exhibits. For the rest of the night. That’s my
routine. In the morning, it starts. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You need a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I just had…a vacation. On the Harbor
Freeway.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. Not in a cab. You need your head straight,
gotta get your unified self up, get harmonic…you know…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: When was the last time you took a break?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I take little ones all the time.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How often?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dozen times a day.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Maldives Islands. It gets heavy, I take five.
Go there.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I couldn’t take that…I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, you could. You need it more than I do. It
helps. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow. Thanks for everything, Max…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: In case you ever…I don’t know…wanna start an
investigation of a Fortune 500 company or argue cab routes or
something…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s go to… You free? Or…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, yeah, sorry…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: 452 South Union Street.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How long you think this’ll take?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fourteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Fourteen? Not fifteen? Not thirteen?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two minutes to get onto the 101. Transition to
the 110 to the 10 and exit on Normandie is four minutes. North on
Normandie is five minutes. Two minutes to South Union ’cause there’s
roadwork. Thirteen plus one for “shit happens.”</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mind if I time you? What do I get if you’re
wrong? A free ride?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: An apology.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …I already offered up the free ride today.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …some girl.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Did you ask her out?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: First time in LA?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No. To tell the truth, whenever I’m here, I
can’t wait to leave. Too sprawled-out. Disconnected. You know…? But
that’s me. You like it here?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s home.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: 17 million people. This was a country, it
would be the fifth biggest economy in the world. But nobody knows each
other. Too impersonal. But that’s just me…you know… I read about this
guy. Gets on the MTA, here, and dies. Six hours he’s riding the subway
before anybody notices. This corpse doing laps around LA, people on and
off, sitting next to him, nobody notices.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I see your point. Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Cleanest cab I’ve ever been in. Your
regular ride?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Prefer nights?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: People are more relaxed, you know? Less stress,
less traffic, better tips.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You get benefits?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like sick leave?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Retirement? Health and welfare?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s not that kind of job.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Start a union.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Me, specifically?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Last thing I need is a reason to keep driving a
cab. It’s temporary. I’m fillin’ in, you know, while this other thing
I’m putting together is shaping up…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How long you been driving?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Really? What else are you putting
together?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t talk about it. No offense, but…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: None taken. Talkers and doers. Like you, I
like doers.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Fourteen minutes. Man, you’re good…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Lucky with the lights.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, sure. You probably know the light
schedules, too. Listen…I’m in town on a real estate deal. A closing. One
night. I got five stops to make, collect signatures. See some friends.
Then I got a six a.m. out of LAX. Why don’t you hang with me for the
night…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m not a hire car. It’s against regs…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Regulations? These guys don’t pay you sick
leave. How much you pull down a shift?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two-fifty, four hundred.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll make it six hundred. Plus an extra
hundred if you get me to LAX and I don’t have to run for the plane.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …take a chance.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Man, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Cool. We got a deal. Here’s three hundred
down. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Max? I’m Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t double park here…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll meet you in the alley behind the
building.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Definitely not from around here.</p>
<p><strong>the dead face of a fat man stares at him.</strong>: Max
recoils with a yell, scrambles from the cab, heart pounding…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He - He fell on my cab…!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You always stutter?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, yeah. Yeah. Guy fell on my motherfucking
cab from up there…!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …taken two .45s and did a high dive onto
his head. It’s a good guess.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You - you killed him?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No. I - I shot him. The bullets and the
fall killed him.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Red-light-green-light? Light’s red.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You can run, but you’ll die tired.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Put down your hands. Are you cool? Say “I
am cool.”</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You are cool.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No. You say you are cool.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I am…I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Okay. Help me out here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: El Gordo decided to get some air and not
take the stairs. So we go to plan B. Pop the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My trunk?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I can’t leave him here. So unless you want
him riding up front with you…and given the hygiene… …and his sphincters
let go…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift
with your legs…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t think I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He’s only a dead guy. On three. Uno. Dos.
Three.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Got it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s a spasm! Jesus, don’t be such a
girl…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Never heard of a treadmill?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Six liters of blood in the average
Angeleno, he’s gotta dump all his…on your cab. Okay, that’s good
enough.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh, look…why don’t you, like, take the cab…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: “Take the cab…”</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. I - I’ll chill. You know. And…they don’t
check. You know? They don’t. They don’t know who’s driving these things.
You, me…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And you promise you will never tell
anybody? Right? …get in the fucking car.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Can we leave the scene of the crime, now,
please?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m trying…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s not me!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: The engine is already on. Put the little
pointer on the letter “D.” “D” stands for Drive.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re making me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m making you nervous? I’m the one on a
schedule…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Ramone? Estas fiestando con una chica?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Try deep breathing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Adrenaline’s wearing off. You get shaky
after. Some people slip into shock. It’s not uncommon. Deep breathing
helps.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Is that better?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s a mess.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Lady Macbeth. Leave the seats. The light’s
green. We’re sitting here.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You no longer have the cleanest cab in
La-La Land. You gotta live with that. Focus on the job. Drive.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: 7565 Fountain. You know it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: West Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How long, you figure?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Seventeen minutes. Why?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh. Oh, no. You’re kidding. We…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I told you we had other stops to make
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You said you were visiting friends!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: They’re somebody’s friends… You drive a
cab. I make my rounds. We both do our jobs, you might make it through
the night and come out seven hundred bucks ahead.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I…I’m not trying to piss you off, see? Okay?
But I can’t drive you around so you can murder people… Man, that’s not
my job…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tonight it is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You don’t get it. I mean it. Really. I’m not up
for this…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You are stressed. I understand that. Keep
breathing. Stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Are you breathing?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Good. What else calms you down? Candy?
Cigarettes? Breathe.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Music.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Play music.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Chopin prelude. Stodgy. Here’s the
deal.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You were gonna drive me around and never be
the wiser. But because of El Gordo’s high dive, we’re into Plan B. Still
breathing? Now. We have to make the best of it. Improvise. Adapt to the
environment. Darwin. “Shit happens.” The I Ching…whatever. Roll with
it…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I Ching? You threw a man out a window!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I didn’t throw him, he fell.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’d he do to you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Nothing. I only met him one time.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then how can you kill him like that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I should only kill people after I get to
know ’em? Six billion people on the planet and you get bent out of shape
’cause of one fat guy?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who, who was he?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Rwanda. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tens of thousands killed before sundown.
Nobody’s killed people that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Did you
bat an eye, Max? Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam or something?
No.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy
fit…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know Rwandans.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You don’t know the guy in the trunk,
either. If it makes you feel any better, he was a criminal involved in a
Continuing Criminal Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, that makes it okay, then. ’Cause all you’re
doing is taking out the garbage…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Something like that… What you need to
remember is that nobody gets out of this alive. Even if we quit smoking.
Cut out red meat. Everybody dies…</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Please pull the vehicle over to the
curb.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Get rid of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’re a cabby. Talk yourself out of a
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Please. Don’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Then don’t let me get cornered. You don’t
have the trunk space.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t believe this…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Believe it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t. I’ll talk to them, I’ll talk to
them…!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Probably married.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Maybe that one’s got kids. Probably his
wife’s pregnant…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll deal with it!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: License and registration.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Pulled you over ’cause your windshield’s
smashed. All of this current?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, officer.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Wha’d you, have a food fight in here?</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Is that blood?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. See… I hit a deer.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: A deer…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Over by Slauson.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: A “South Central” deer?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Goddamn deer jumped out in front of me. You
believe that?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Why you still carrying a passenger?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I was headed back to my depot, see, you know?
And his drop’s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Yeah, but your cab’s not safe to drive. And
we’re going to impound it. We need to do a vehicle inventory while we
wait for the tow truck. Pop the trunk and step out of the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, you’ll have to phone for
another cab.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Is that necessary, Officer? I’m just a half
mile from here.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: I’m afraid it is. Please exit the vehicle.
You, too.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You open that trunk, they go inside.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, man, it’s been a long day. You know? It’s
so slow, I pay this guy to ride so I don’t get lonely… My first fare.
How about a break? I’m heading to the barn, anyway…</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Get out of the car. And open the trunk…</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: Officer needs help. We got a man with
a gun. Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover…</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Get that cab back to your garage…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Breathe.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I thought Californians exercised…?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What are you lookin’ at?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hands on the wheel. Ten and two. Like they
taught you in driver’s ed.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Because I say so.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Cab’s a disgrace. No wonder the cops pulled
you over.</p>
<p><strong>dispatch radio</strong>: Max? Max? You out there, you son of
a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Who…is that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Lenny, my dispatcher.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I know you’re out there! Answer the goddamn
call!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What happens if you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’ll keep calling.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Max? Answer!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Don’t blow it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh, yeah? Lenny? It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I got off the phone with the cops. A desk
sergeant called to check you brought the cab in…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah? So?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So? So, aside from I hate talking to cops,
they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It got crashed! I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Do I care what, where or why? You’re
payin’!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It was an accident. You’re not liable.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was an accident. I’m not liable.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Bullshit! I’m making you liable! It’s comin’
outta your goddamn pocket…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell him to stick the cab up his fat
ass.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t do that. He’s the Man.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I need the job.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You still there? I’m talking to you! Max?
Max?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He’s not paying you a damn thing!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Richard Riccardo, Assistant U.S. Attorney.
A passenger in this taxicab, and I’m reporting you to the</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Let’s not get excited.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Not excited? How am I supposed to not get
excited, listening to you try to extort a working man? You know goddamn
well your collision policy and general liability umbrella would cover
the damages. What are you trying to pull, you sarcastic prick?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I’m just tryin’ to…to…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell it to him. Tell him he’s an
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell him next time he pulls any shit,
you’re gonna stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Next time you pull any shit, I’m gonna stick
this yellow cab up your fat ass.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Don’t wait up, hon. I gotta work late.</p>
<p><strong>sylvester clarke</strong>: He identify himself? Sure. Let him
up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh. Oh, thank God! Hey, hey, man, help me out
here!</p>
<p><strong>white guy #1</strong>: Yo, whassup?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel,
here, by this guy, who’s taped me in the car, ’cause he’s up in the
building somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>white guy #2</strong>: You all trapped in there and shit?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …yeah, he’s coming back. Hurry. Get me loose so
I can call the cops…</p>
<p><strong>white guy #1</strong>: Fuck that, man, gimme your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>white guy #1</strong>: I will fuck you up! Hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My hands are taped to the damn steering
wheel!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me…</p>
<p><strong>white guy #1</strong>: Then get your ass up, up…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yo’ homie…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That my briefcase…?</p>
<p><strong>white guy #2</strong>: May-be. And what the fuck else you
got?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Where’s the button? Under the dash?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You mind turning it off?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Another collateral.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Collateral damage. People in the wrong
place at the wrong time. And you? You attract attention? You are gonna
get people killed who didn’t need to be. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m low on gas…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Pull in there.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yes, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Am I collateral?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I haven’t decided.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: But, hey! New news. We are ahead of
schedule.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Huh…?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We got time to kill. You like jazz?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m…what? Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not that much.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Guy told me about a place off Crenshaw.
Leimert Park. All the West Coast greats played there. Dexter Gordon,
Thelonious Monk, Chet Baker. Like that… Buy you a drink. Expand your
horizons…</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: …this informant of yours, what’s his name,
Ramone?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Ramone Gallardo. Supposed to take him for a
drink. I come here, find this.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: You been working him?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Four months…a low-level player, he’s been
feeding me stuff on Felix.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Reyes-Torrena? Forget Felix. Feds are all
over that. They don’t want us anywhere near it.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Since when is the LAPD working for the
Feeb? Besides, Ramone flew out a window. My C.I. flew out a window, he’s
got Felix’s handprints on his ass. Yes? That makes it ours.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Where’s the homicide, Ray? Where’s a body?
All we got is glass…</p>
<p><strong>female criminalist</strong>: And blood…</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>female criminalist</strong>: …blood…down here…in the
glass…here’s some more…</p>
<p><strong>female criminalist</strong>: …small splatter patterns
here…all over there…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Ramone flew out the window. Went splat.
Here’s the glass. Then some tires rolled over it.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: How’s that spell homicide? Maybe he
jumped.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Sure. He’s depressed. So he jumps four
stories out a window onto his head.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: “Wow, that feels better!” Picks himself up.
“Now, I think I’ll go on with the rest of my day…”</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes cop</strong>: Ray! Catch!</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: So, who’s got what? Any witnesses? We been
knocking on doors?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Old guy across the street, lives above the
deli? Says he saw a cab parked here earlier tonight. There were two guys
working under the hood.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Description. What did he see?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: “Kinda” saw…guy’s got glasses like coke
bottles.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Did he “see” it or did his seeing eye dog
see it?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Late-model four-door Ford. Yellow or orange.
Maybe it was a taxi cab.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Four thousand taxis in LA County. What
else…?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Remember fall, 2001? That Bay Area deal?
Oakland. Cabbie drove around all night. Killed three people…</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Then he flipped out, put the gun to his
head. So what?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: So the Oakland PD detective, whatshisname,
never bought it.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: The Cabbie had no criminal record. No
history of mental illness. Pops three people, then himself? And the
victims weren’t random. Two were involved in some pharmaceuticals scam…
Anyway, the detective always thought there was somebody else in that
cab.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …a little ’60’s, early Miles thing
happening…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I never learned to listen to jazz.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You don’t learn to listen…anymore than you
learn to breathe. Open your ears.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I get a beat. I don’t really hear a melody…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …he’s off the melody, behind the notes.
Outside what’s expected. Improvising off impulse. Kind of like
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Like tonight?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sure. This is nothing, if not “What’s next?
Right now. In the moment.” There’s people…ten years from now? Same job,
same place, same shit. Everything the same; keepin’ it safe. Over and
over and over and over… “Ten years from now?” Man, you don’t know where
you’ll be…ten minutes from now…tonight. That’s what he’s saying. Open
your ears. You’ll hear it…in his “dialoguing” with the trumpet…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: ’Nother Vodka tonic, hon?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And one for my friend. Who’s on the tenor
sax?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: That’s Daniel, baby, he’s the owner.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He is terrific. Would you be so kind as to
invite him over after his set? I gotta buy him a drink.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sure thing, darlin’…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: …I was a young cat back then, about
nineteen, bussin’ tables. Right here. Didn’t pay but shit, but that
wasn’t the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was.
Take this one night…July 22, 1964…who walks in. Mr. Louis Armstrong.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’re kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Right through those doors. The man
himself.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: He was in town playing two gigs a night at
the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel… After his last set, he
decides to come on down to South Central to hang with his people. That’s
how he was, you see. Never forgot who we was. Money and fame an’ all
that? Meant nothin’, long as he could blow that horn.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: So before you know it, he’s up on that
stage, doin’ his thing.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Was it great? Better than great, it had to
be…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure,
spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You heard Armstrong play live. I’ve never
been this jealous. You get to talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Did better’n that.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Oh, my, yes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Fella owned this place back then, cat named
Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played. So Pops, he just waves me
right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and
we played for nearly twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Unbelievable… …you hearing this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: How do you think? You ain’t shit when you
playing next to Louis Armstrong. But, Dippermouth, he was kind. He could
see me trying. He carried my ass as best he could.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Remember what you played?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Most vividly. “Potato Head Blues,” “Sleepy
Time Down South…” …then Pops laid some “Cornet Chop Suey” on me, and
left me in the dust like a whipped dog.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Whipped dog?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Whipped dog on a wet night.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Crowd dig it?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: The crowd was most kind. I was born in 1945,
but that was the moment of my conception. Right here in the used-to-be
crowded room.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Crowds not here now?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Oh, jazz ain’t the draw it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: But the place looks great.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Only ‘cause I got the wherewithal to finance
keepin’ it up on my own.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What a great story. I’ll tell the folks in
Culiacan and Bogota that story.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You know the people in Culiacan and
Bogota?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: ’Fraid so.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: And here I thought you were such a cool
guy.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I am a cool guy. With a job I was hired to
do. You know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Let him go, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m working here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re the one who keeps talking about going
with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a
little jazz, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Improvisation? That’s funny from you. Okay,
some jazz for the jazz man. How’s this? I’ll ask a question?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What question?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Jazz question. You get it right, we roll.
You disappear. Tonight. You don’t go home, you don’t pack a bag, you
leave town…and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you
again.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: How do I know you’ll keep your word?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. No. He hasn’t lied…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Means you’re a man who lives on reputation.
I will take your word. And I will give you mine. If I walk out of here
tonight, I’d go so far away, it’d be just like I was dead.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: And one more thing. Those guys and their
man, here, what’s his name, Felix?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Tell them, if by some chance I get this
wrong…you tell them I had to. They laid a grant of immunity on me. So it
was flip and play ball or go back inside. I ain’t goin’ back inside.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Lay it on.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s simple. What was Louis’ first musical
instrument?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I know all there is to know about Louis.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Then let’s have it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was a trumpet! Wasn’t it? Wasn’t it a
trumpet?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Coronet. Bought it from a New Orleans
pawnshop when he was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Cost him five dollars. Got a two- dollar
advance on his salary from a fine Jewish family he worked for, saved up
the rest.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tin horn. Cost him a dime. Rode the junk
wagon and played for the neighborhood. People sold them stuff. Rags.
Bottles. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What you mean, no?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m done. Find another cab.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Leave me alone. I’m collateral anyway, so do it
and stop making me a part of this! I don’t wanna know you!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m not playing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You played him, man. He got the answer right,
would you have let him go?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Max? Maaax. Pick up, you dipshit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What is it with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Maaaaaax!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You hassling my man again?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Same fare you talked to last time.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What are you guys, taking an all-night
tour?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We’re gay lovers, what’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Nothing! Aside from every night Max’s mother
driving me crazy, I’m dancin’ on a rainbow! May he come on the line,
please.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hang on. Carefully…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Your mother’s calling every ten minutes. Why
didn’t he show? Are you all right? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Show for what?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell her I can’t make it tonight, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What am I, related to you? You tell her
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Show up for what?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She’s in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You visit every night?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Cause if you don’t show it breaks a
routine.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So people start looking for you, this cab.
That is not good.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. I can’t take you to see my mother…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Since when was any of this negotiable?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Stay three paces in front of me and one to
my left…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Flowers?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Waste of money. Won’t mean a thing to her.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: She carried you in her womb for nine
months.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hold, please…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Five. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Having a good night?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Mezzo-mezzo. You?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hi, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’ve been calling and calling.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I got caught up at work.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Why couldn’t you call me on the telephone? I’m
lying here, wondering if something horrible happened to you…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I brought you flowers.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: What am I gonna do with flowers?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re gonna cheer up.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: How? By worrying… …that you spend money on
things…that all they’re gonna do is wilt and die?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: See? I didn’t buy ’em. He did.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Who? Come in. What I got is not contagious. Why
didn’t you tell me we had company? And what’s your name? Sorry. My son
is rude.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No harm done, madam.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You paid for my flowers? They’re beautiful.
Max, will you introduce us?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mom, Vincent. Vincent, my mother, Ida.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m really happy to meet you,
Mrs. Rilke.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Oh, call me Ida. To what do we owe this
pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well, I was with Max when he got the
call.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: And you came all the way here to see me?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Tell my son. You have to hold a gun to his head
to get him to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You must be an important client of Max’s.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Client? I like to think of myself as his
friend. A mentor.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Max never had many friends. Always talking to
himself in the mirror… It’s unhealthy.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, mom. How many times do I have to ask you
not to do that?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Talk about me like…I’m…not…in the room,
here.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: What’s he sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Ida, he says he’s standing right here. In
the room. Here.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Yesss, you are, honey. He’s sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I know. But I’m sure you’re proud of
him.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Of course I’m proud. You know, he started with
nothing. Look at him today. Here. Vegas. Reno…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mom, Vincent’s not interested. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: What’s your name, again?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Vincent…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I came to see you. I saw you. You look fine.
Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Limousine companies.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: He drives famous people around, you know?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Limousine companies? What an
achievement…</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Visit again?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m only in town tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: When you come back?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sure. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Well, nice to meet you, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Stop or I’ll go back and kill her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’d do her a favor.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll tell her the truth!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Red-light-green-light, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What the fuck was that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You are screwing…with my work! My prep was
in there. I’m coming up on number four. The night is no longer young.
Are we getting adversarial?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Didn’t know you could do that… Let’s see
what else you can do.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: We’ve had three come in tonight. Two John
Does. Maybe one’s your guy.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: No. Not Ramone.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Try that one.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: No. Next…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: That’s what’s funny. These three came in
within half an hour of each other. And the kid and that last guy …they
were done by the same shooter.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Same wound pattern. Two in the sternum.
One in the head. Add this cat’s shooting tight groups. Double taps are a
couple millimeters apart.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: …yeah, I’m still at MLK. The John Doe
doesn’t pan out. Not Ramone. But you’ll never guess who else is in the
meat locker.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Elvis Presley?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Sylvester Clarke. Criminal-lawyer turned
lawyer-criminal?</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: “Sly” to his clients…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: …including my high-diving informant,
Ramone, who he represented, who’s still missing. Both of whom were in
the exotic-substances business…</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Ramone and “Sly” Clarke in one night?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: In one night. Something bad is going down.
And I don’t think the Feeb know about it…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Limos, huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t start.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hey, I’m not the one lying to my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She hears what she wants to hear. I don’t
disillusion her.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, right. Maybe she hears what you tell
her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Whatever I tell her’s never good enough. It’s
always been that way… My three older brothers…their wives made ’em move
outta town.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’re goin’ to a place called El Rodeo.
It’s on Whittier Boulevard in Anaheim.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where on Whittier?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Look it up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s at El Rodeo?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Just drive. They project onto you their
flaws, what they don’t like about themselves, their lives, whatever. And
then they rank on you, instead…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I had a father like that.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mothers are worse.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mine died when I was one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He hated whatever I did. Got drunk. Beat me
up all the time.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I killed him. I was 12.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He was the first. I’m kidding. He died of
liver cancer.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No you’re not. So driving this cab
“temporarily” is all bullshit…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s not bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Twelve years is not temporary.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You gotta get cash together. Insurance, bond,
maintenance, tires. Staff-up. Client lists. It’s not get the car, put
asses on seats.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ’Cause Island Limos will be more than a
ride…like a club experience, a cool groove you don’t want to end. Like
that. So it’s gotta be perfect. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Plus I got bills. She’s been dying of the
disease since I was in high school…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Here’s good.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Gimme your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll hold it for you in case they search
you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: In case who searches?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: The people inside. Go in and ask for Felix.
He’s expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Felix? Okay. What’s he look like?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Dunno. Never met him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He’s from who hired me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You destroyed my work-ups. And number four
is due. Whatta you think, night’s over? Called on account of rain? Go be
me. In there. Score the backups. He’ll have ’em on a flash drive or
CD…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why don’t you go?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: They don’t know what I look like. And I
don’t meet people. Like in risk management. Protect anonymity. And
you’re not going to screw that up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’m I gonna be you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Max, who’s SoCal Cab Company? Ralph
SoCal?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Ever met the owner?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well, I don’t work for them. I work for
their bosses. They don’t get to meet me, either.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If…if I don’t pull it off…?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: They’re gonna kill you. You got ten
minutes. 10:01? I drive the cab to the hospital and execute your mother
on my way out of town…and don’t pretend indifference.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You threw my PC onto the freeway. You’ve
got balls bigger than Toledo.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If I pull it off, it’s gonna get other people
killed…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Out of options, Max. Take comfort in
knowing you never had a choice.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh, how long you been doin’ this?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: In case he asks.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Private sector? Six years.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You get benefits?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No. Nor paid sick leave. Quit stalling. Get
out of the cab.</p>
<p><strong>fed #1</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>fed #2</strong>: Not Julio Iglesias…</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Mark the time.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh, hi…</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Que pasa? Wha’s up, homes?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m here to see Felix. He has something for
me.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Don’t know no Felix.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh. Say…say it’s Vincent. I’m Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Lt. Richard Weidner. LAPD. Major Narcotics
Division.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Detective Ray Fanning. LAPD. Major Nar…</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Yeah, hi, okay. Agent Frank Pedrosa.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Thanks for seeing us…</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Yeah. You’re welcome. How can I help?
What’s up? Why do you wanna know about our case?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Has there been any unusual activity
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: As in…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: As in a murder or maybe a murder spree in
Wilshire Central.</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: All quiet on the western front. Various
people are asleep. Various people are not. They come and go in cars,
pickups and taxis. Other than that, we’re watching air move. …your
interest in our case?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Hood’s all beat to shit.</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: On what?!</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: On that.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: What’s the license number?</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: I thought you’d be taller.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Anyway I look at this, I see only one thing.
I see one thing with you. Here. Tonight. I see trouble.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: So. Vincent. Explain…</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Don’t know no Felix.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m Vincent…</p>
<p><strong>fed #3</strong>: Did he say “Vincent?”</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Vincent don’t meet people. The jefes in
Culiacan, Bogota, maybe. But he won’t talk to you. But, now you are
here. Okay. Why?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I lost my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: “Stuff”? Your “stuff”?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: I want you to listen to me real well. Special
teams put together that list of…“dedos.”</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dedos?</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Fingers. Informants. Signal intercepts,
voice-recognizing software, surveillance…very expensive counterintel
produced that list. An important list, wouldn’t you say? And you “lost”
it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Sorry? Sorry does not put back together again
Humpty Dumpty…</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Do you believe in Santa Claus?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Neither do I. But my children do. They are
still small. But do you know who they like even better than Santa Claus?
His helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter. There’s an old Mexican tale that
tells of how Santa Claus got so very busy looking out for the good
children that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children.
So he hired Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a list with all the names of
all the bad children, and Pedro would come every night to check them
out. And the people, the little kids that were misbehaving, that were
not saying their prayers, Pedro would leave a little wooden donkey on
their windows. And he would come back and if the children were still
misbehaving, he would take them away and nobody would ever see them
again. Now, if I am Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do you think
jolly old Santa Claus would feel if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, ‘I lost the list.’? How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa
Claus would get?!</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: So tell me, Vincent. Tell me what you
think.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think…</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think… …I think you should tell the man
behind me to put that gun away.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I said. Tell him to put the gun away. Before I
take it and beat his bitch ass to death with it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I picked up a tail.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Federal?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You tell me. How do I know? So I tossed the
list and work-ups to protect…in part… …your Hermes, Facconable sorry
ass.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You think I like comin’ here? Like I got stupid
all of an instant? Shit happens. You gotta roll with it. Darwin. I
Ching…</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Has, uh…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The fat man. The penthouse guy. The jazz man.
It leaves two.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Can you finish?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: In six years, have I ever not?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: …are you telling me Ramone Gallardo and
Sylvester Clarke were murdered tonight? Both killed…?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: …Sylvester for sure, Ramone…</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: We got another D.O.A. One “Daniel Baker” in
South Central…</p>
<p><strong>fed #3</strong>: That’s three? He killed three in one
night?</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: Three what?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Three witnesses. For a secret grand jury,
secret my ass…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: So who’s left? Before you lose them,
too…</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: The last two…</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Do not fail.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I never do.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And as a token of appreciation…I want to offer
you a discount. Yeah. All my services, here, tonight… Twenty-five
percent off.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Twenty-five?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hell, make it fifty.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Very generous.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: By the way. Daniel said he was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Go to Fever. He’s met me. If it begins to go
wrong, close his eyes. He cannot fall into their hands…</p>
<p><strong>all the feds</strong>: …his face, make sure you get his
face…Vincent the ghost…too grainy, too much noise…plus twelve dB of
gain, you get noise or you get no image…you getting this? …yeah…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: …yeah, uh-huh…African-American, medium
build, dark hair…are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: LA101 to chase units… I want a three-car
revolving tail on that cab. LA102 is on him, now, at El Rodeo. We will
do a take-down of the cab with Vincent in it before he gets where he’s
going. Locate our witness, Peter Yip…wife, girlfriends, mommy, daddy,
whatever. Get him evacuated. Get him safe. On the cab, the assault team,
when they are in place, will do the take- down. Do NOT spook him before.
I want Air Support up and to maintain at 1,500 feet.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: E-mail me his license. Okay? I’ll wait…
Anybody else in that cab?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Vegas odds would have compelled a “don’t
pass” bet on you walking out of there…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …I’m very impressed.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Washington Boulevard. After-hours dance
club near Crenshaw called “Fever.” Know it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Twelve minutes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’ll be late. Jump on the freeway and get
me to the 105 west.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: …according to the cab company’s dispatcher,
this cabbie’s been driving that cab for twelve years…</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: …so, you’re telling me this cabbie walks
into a phone booth and, shazaam, changes into a meat-eater, super-
assassin? What’s he do, squeeze ’em in between fares?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: No. Cabdriver Max is floating down a storm
drain. He is stuffed in the trunk of a cab. He is being devoured by
flesh-eating stretococcus…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: The guy, who walked out, looks like this
guy…!</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: ’Cause he picked a cabdriver who looks like
him…</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: What’s Vincent look like?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Who knows. He’s a ghost… Vincent’s not even
his name.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>fed #1</strong>: We see private-sector security working for
cartel groups in Colombia, Russia, Mexico…hiring ex-Special Forces
types, ex-KGB all the time…</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Guys with trigger time, skill sets…real
tradecraft… …like, look like a “cabdriver.”</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Take down his ass. Save our witness.</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: What if they’re wrong?</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: The guy identified himself as “Vincent” and
just met with the bad people!</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Bullshit. There is something else going
on.</p>
<p><strong>weidner</strong>: It’s not our game!</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #3</strong>: I follow him up there…we blow the
tail!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #4</strong>: LA103 to LA101. Pedrosa, Pedrosa… Air
support…</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #3</strong>: LA103 to Air 4…you still have him?</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: Air 4 to LA103. I lost him. You’re
in controlled air space. I gotta stay out until I get clearance from LAX
tower…</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #4</strong>: Pedrosa…!</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: …you lost him? He can head anywhere out of
LAX. North or south on the 405, east on the 105, the 110…</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: They locate Peter Yip?</p>
<p><strong>fed #1</strong>: On with the wife. She thinks he’s at Fever.
They called. Can’t get through.</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Washington and Crenshaw. Move! LA101 to
LA103, LA104, LA105. Fever. After-hours club on 2407 Washington, near
Crenshaw. Pico Union. Hit it!</p>
<p><strong>la105</strong>: LA105 to LA101. Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Would you have called her?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Your lady friend. The one who gave you her
business card. Or was she just being polite?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why hold back? Why not act off your
impulse? Pick up the phone?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: All I owe a fare is a ride, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s not what you owe me. Time is fleeting.
Life is short. Time is luck. One day it’s gone… You make it out of this
alive, you should call her. That’s what I think…anyway…</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: There…!</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: We get Yip out. You take Vincent. Clean
shots! Watch your backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Booth towards the back. That’s where he
hangs. Fat Korean guy. Terminal acne as a youth. You go first.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Fifteen feet in front and three to my left.
Wander, and innocent bystanders get the first rounds. Clear?</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: There’s Yip! Get him out of here!</p>
<p><strong>pedrosa</strong>: Middle of the dance floor! There he is!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t shoot! I’m not Vincent!</p>
<p><strong>paco</strong>: You’re…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m Max! I’m a goddamn cab driver!</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: I know. I know!</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: I’m Detective Fanning, LAPD! I’m getting
you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, man, am I happy to see you! I don’t believe
it!</p>
<p><strong>fanning</strong>: Yeah. I know. Relax. Breathe. You’re
okay.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it…!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What a clusterfuck. Only thing didn’t show
up was the Polish cavalry.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You don’t wanna talk, tell me to fuck
off…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …blood, bodily fluid and death get to you?
Try deep breathing. Or remember, we all die anyway…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You had to kill Fanning?!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Who’s Fanning?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That cop! Why’d you have to do that? You
couldn’t wound him? The guy had a family, maybe parents, kids who gotta
grow up without a dad, he was a good guy, and he believed me…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I shoulda saved him ’cause he believed
you…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, not just that.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, that…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, so, what’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s what I do for a living…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Some living.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Head downtown…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s downtown?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How are you at math? I was hired for five
hits. I did four.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: One more.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: There you go…!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Whyn’t you kill me and find another cab.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: ’Cause you’re good. We’re in this together.
You know…fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence. All that crap…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m full of shit? You’re a monument of it.
You even bullshitted yourself, all I am is taking out the garbage. Bad
guys killing bad guys…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ’Cause that’s what you said…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: And you believe me…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’d they do?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How do I know? But, they all got that
“witness for the prosecution” look to me. It’s probably some major
federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get
indicted… I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s the reason?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s the “why.” There is no reason. No
good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then what are you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …indifferent.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Get with it. Get over it. …millions of
galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a
blink…that’s us. Lost in space. The universe don’t care . The cop, you,
me? Who notices?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s with you…?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: As in…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Man, if someone had a gun to your head and
said: “You gotta tell me what’s goin’ on with that person across the
street, there, what they think, who they are, how they feel, or I will
kill you”…they’d have to kill you…wouldn’t they…? ’Cause you don’t have
a clue…about…anyone. …I don’t think you, you have a clue, period. Did
anyone “do” for you in your life…? Ever? When you draw breath in the
morning? Open your eyes in the a.m.? You anticipate…anything? Want
anything? Expect anything? I don’t think so… ’Cause you are low, my
brother, way low… and some standard parts that are supposed to be
there?…with you, aren’t. So what happened to you, man? What happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …all the cabbies in LA, I get Max, Sigmund
Freud meets Dr. Ruth…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Look in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …with your paper towels…a bottle of 409…a
limo company someday. How much you got saved?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Your business “plan?” Someday? “Someday my
dream’ll come…”? And one night you’ll wake up and discover it all
flipped on you. Suddenly you’re old. And it didn’t happen. And it never
will. ‘Cause you were never going to do it, anyway. The dream on the
horizon became yesterday and got lost. Then you’ll bullshit yourself, it
could never have been, anyway. And you’ll recede it into memory…and zone
out in a Barcalounger with daytime TV on for the rest of your life…
Don’t talk to me about killing. You’re do-in’ yourself. In this
yellow-and-orange prison. Bit by bit. Every day.</p>
<p><strong>extremely close</strong>: Max is soaking up every word.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: All it ever took was a down payment on a
Lincoln Town Car. What the hell are you still doing in a cab?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ’Cause I never straightened-up and looked at
it, you know…?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …myself, I should have. My brothers did… Tried
to gamble my way out from under. Another born-to-lose deal! Then, “it’s
gotta be perfect to go!” You know? Risk all torqued-down.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But you know what? It doesn’t matter. What’s it
matter, anyway? ’Cause we are…insignificant out here in this big-ass
nowhere. Twilight Zone shit. Says the badass sociopath in my backseat.
So that’s one thing I got to thank you for, bro… Until now, I never saw
it that way…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That was a red light!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …not until now. So what’s it all matter? It
don’t. Fuck it. Fix it. Nothing to lose. Right?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Slow the hell down!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why? What are you gonna do? Pull the trigger?
Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot…my ass.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Slow down!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well. That was brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: 12A75 requesting an RA unit at Grand and
9th for a TC with injuries…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Are you alright? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You’ve been in an accident. An ambulance
is on the way to help you. Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Sit down on the curb. Okay? Anybody else in there?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Don’t worry about the cab. They’ll get you
a new one. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m…fine. Fine. Just dizzy and shit.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sit there and breathe deep, sir. You’ll be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Put your hands where I can see ’em! Get on
your knees! Slowly!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sure. Arrest me. Take me in. Police station. LA
County’s good.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get your hand off your gun!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, someone’s gonna get killed if I don’t,
it’s…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: NO! I gotta go, see, you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: HEY, HEY! When did this become a
negotiation?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Cuff yourself to the goddamn door.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You’re in a world of shit…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good! Do us a favor. Call the police! I’m going
to 6th and Fig. I got no time to explain…</p>
<p><strong>partier</strong>: Hey, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: C’mon, go through, go through…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Annie Farrell.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Annie…it’s Max.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Max…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Max, the cab driver!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Max? …kind of a strange time to be
calling…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Listen! Listen, okay? There’s a man. His name’s
Vincent. He’s come to kill you!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He’s…what? Where are you…?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Kill you! He is coming to kill you!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Is this a joke? ’Cause it is not funny.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A guy, Felix, hired him! Or people Felix works
for. He’s already killed witnesses, now he’s coming after you! He was
scoping out your building when I dropped you off. I don’t know what
happened, but he got into my cab.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Did you say Felix? As in Reyes- Torrena? How
do you know about my case? I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It doesn’t matter! Get out of the goddamn
building…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: …okay, okay, Max, I believe you…I’ll get out
of the building…</p>
