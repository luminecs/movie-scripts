<p><strong>porno-channel chick</strong>: Oooh, yeah. Oh, baby, you’re so
good.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, I’m the best, baby.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …oh – that was a tit, tits…</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel chick</strong>: Give it to me! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh yeah, baby, I’ll give it to you.</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel chick</strong>: Don’t you love my sexy
body?!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I do, baby, I do.</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel chick</strong>: You’re so big!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel stud</strong>: Ohhh, tell me you’re a nasty
girl!</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel stud</strong>: Yeahhh, you been bad, real
bad!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Man, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s mom</strong>: Hey, Jimmy. I just wanted to say sweet
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yep, okay Mom, ’night.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s mom</strong>: Kiss goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s mom</strong>: Is something wrong with the
reception?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah. Damn cable. There’s this nature show that
I’m trying to watch.</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel chick</strong>: Fuck me! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Must…be…broken…</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: What the heck is this?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s mom</strong>: I think he’s trying to watch one of the
illegal channels.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesus, Mom! They’re not illegal! They’re pay
channels. How could a television channel be illegal?! God, get a
clue!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: James, don’t speak that way to your
mother!</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel stud</strong>: Play with my hairy balls!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Turn that garbage off! Give me that!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s mom</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Honey, why don’t you let me handle this
one.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Jesus Christ. The dictionary? Hell, son,
I’ll buy you some dirty magazines.</p>
<p><strong>porno-channel chick</strong>: Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank
me!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got
in.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: “Dear Ms. Hughes. We’re sorry, but after
keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we’ve decided
you are now rejected. Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how
rejected you are.”</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Kevin, this is serious!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You got in.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I love you!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Illegal channels? Shit, if there’s any channel
that should be illegal, it’s whatever that women’s channel is. Lifetime
Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah – hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on
TV the other night? That Ariel, whew.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: She’s a mermaid, dude.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, Oz, but not when she’s on land.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: She’s a cartoon, dude.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A hot cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Is there anything you don’t jerk off to?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: C-Span?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Then she said – she loves me.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Oh shit dude, the L-word!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And you said…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Nothing, I just hugged her back.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You think she was serious?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I couldn’t tell – She could’ve meant like, “I
love you grandma” or “I love you Vanderbilt.”</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Just don’t bring it up, hang low, maybe she
won’t mention it again.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: And what we should do today, in band?
Instead of playing our instruments regularly? We should play them
backwards! That’ll be so funny!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You guys got the Latin homework?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No – Kevin, you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Please. We’re all golden, we’re college
bound. I figured it out – I can get a c- minus in every class, and it’s
not gonna make a difference. U of M, here I come.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Vanderbilt’s not that far from U of M.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yeah right.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: What? We both have cars.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yeah but, no offense, you’re talking about
a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin
haven’t even done it yet.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: That’s not why we’re going out.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What the hell are you expecting him to
drive to Vanderbilt for? Milk and cookies?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Jessica! He’ll drive there for me, and I’ll
drive to Ann Arbor for him. We’re going to have sex when he’s ready and
I’m ready. It’s got to be completely perfect. I want the right place,
the right time, the right moment.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Vicky, it’s not a space shuttle launch,
it’s sex. So did you do the physics write-up?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There’s our man.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Finch, you got the Latin homework?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Non habeo. Canis meus id comedit.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Stifler!!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya
fuckface?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Depends if my date wants to stop by.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: That junior chick?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Nah, gave her the Heisman. I’m working on
something new.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Yeah right. I got an idea for something
new. How ‘bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink
wrap, and fuckin’ use ’em.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dude, it’s gotta happen – she’s a college
chick!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Bullshit. From where?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: She works part-time at my dad’s store.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it’s more like your
dad works at her store.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dude, he does not.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Really, Stifler. He’s the manager.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Hey, man, I’m not making fun. I’m fuckin’
impressed. I mean, “Footlong or six-inch, white or wheat,” that’s some
serious shit to master.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Stifler, you’re such an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Meyers, what’s the deal with you and Vicky,
anyway? You’ve been going out since Homecoming and all she’ll do is blow
you? Shit, I’d drop her like a steaming turd.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of
stool?</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: I do when I’m throwing them at your mom,
you damn freak. Alright then, see you guys tonight. I’ll look for you in
the No Fucking section.</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: You called me to ask me how to get
laid?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What was I gonna do, call dad? I don’t even
know his number.</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Just dial 976-Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah, well anyway…I thought you might have
some advice, brother to brother. I mean, I think tonight she might, we
might really, there’s a chance that – you know.</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Have you ever heard of the
bible?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What? Not the Bible?</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Well, that’s not really the name,
but we always called it that.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Does it tell me how to get laid?</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: You know what, nevermind. You’re
not ready.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Ready for what?</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Whoop, you’re fading out. Good luck
at that party.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You ever hear of something called The
Bible?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Once, in church, dude.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ooh, here’s an easy one: “Attractive SWF, fun
loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion.”
Okay…“Attractive”…ugly.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: “Fun loving” – insane.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Unlisted age, plus “youthful mind,” equals
old.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, “Charming” is old. “Older” is really old.
“Youthful mind” is dead.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Perhaps you should consider actually
answering an ad.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead
insane chick. Eat your damn imitation hot dog.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: This is no imitation. Removing the hot dog
from the Ultradog yields a better dog. Behold – Ultradog, no dog.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Alright…I’m shooting for a nine o’clock ETA.
Beer in hand by five after.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You can crash at Stifler’s?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s all good. Breath check.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dude, I wish you wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You got something up your sleeve for tonight,
Finch?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: A foolproof plan, my friend. You shall
see.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: And little hurly-burly came by in her
curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: How the hell do you know all these random
songs?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: It’s early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.
This was before the cheesy remake.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This was remade? Into what?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Bli-hinded by the light – cut loose like a
deuce, another runner in the night, blinded…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: At least now I know what the hell they’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So, does my hair look better – like this, or…
like this?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she
might be there tonight. Now, do you think she’d prefer – Cool Hip Jim…
or Laid Back Jim?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The difference is so phenomenal, I can’t
decide.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What about you? You’re the one with the
girlfriend and you’re still stranded on third base.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You know, I’ve never got that shit. What
exactly constitutes third base?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Contact, dude.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Then where does a blowjob figure in?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Shortstop. ’Course, you don’t make it to third,
and you’re out.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So let’s say you get there…what’s uh, third
base feel like?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh, man, that’s kind of sad.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Feels like warm apple pie, dude.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Apple pie… McDonald’s or homemade?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What’s up, fellas?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey Sherman. Scopin’ the babes.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Indeed. Some fine ladies here, boys.
Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to
DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’ve got something going?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Did you see that Central chick?
Brunette?</p>
<p><strong>kevin/jim</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: She’s around. Seems that she’s taken a
liking to me. Fellas, it’s time that she experienced – The
Sherminator.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m a sophisticated sex robot, sent back
through time…to change the future for one lucky lady.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah man, right on!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, shit! There she is. Nadia.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: You like her? Her sponsor family lives on my
block. Why don’t you talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What would I say?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Just tell her what’s on your mind. And smile,
you’ve got a good smile. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You are in my English class, no?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No…you…go…ahead.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, shit. No! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: We’re here for the party?</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: What party? There’s no party.</p>
<p><strong>party guy</strong>: Stiff-lerrr! Par-tyyy!!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Try the house down the street.</p>
<p><strong>band dork</strong>: Ring the bell again.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Ringing the bell is dorky – let’s just go
in.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Oh, Kev.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Vicky – do you think, maybe…it’s time for us
to take the next step in our relationship?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah, it’s such a perfect evening. Isn’t this
how you’ve always pictured it?</p>
<p><strong>party guy</strong>: Dude, my farts fuckin’ stink!</p>
<p><strong>party guy #2</strong>: You reek like a fuckin’ Yeti, dude! Go
take a shit or something!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Or not.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Just relax.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Great evening, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: There’s something about the spring that’s just
cool. Like the smell of fresh rain or something.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Suck me, beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Suck me…beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Uh…you know, my friends call me Nova – as in
Casanova.</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: You need some work, buddy!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Well…jeez, don’t laugh at me.</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: Look, Chris. There are just some
things you need to learn, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: Alright, well…you’ve got to tone it
down. You don’t need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines
to be romantic.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: …okay…</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: You have to pay attention to a girl.
Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I’m not good in math.</p>
<p><strong>college chick</strong>: Come on, I’ll drop you off at your
friends’.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: You actually said that?! Haaaah!!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Oh that’s really reassuring. And don’t call me
Nova anymore. I’m a fraud.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: This is pathetic. I’m gonna find me a
little hottie.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Let me know.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay, don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: There we go.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: God dammit, Stifler!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Check-out time! Please vacate the room.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Stifler, you’re such a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Vicky, wait!</p>
<p><strong>sophomore chick</strong>: God, I can’t believe there are so
many cool people at this party.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>sophomore</strong>: And you got a keg, too, wow. Oh, wait, I
left my beer downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Here, babe.</p>
<p><strong>sophomore chick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: You’re really beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>sophomore chick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>sophomore chick</strong>: I don’t know if I want to be doing
this.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>sophomore chick</strong>: You know. If we hook up, tomorrow
I’ll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>sophomore chick</strong>: Steve! You could at least look at
me when you say that.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Look… …Sarah. I wouldn’t go telling stories
or whatever about you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What the hell? I should be able to talk to
chicks. I’m articulate. I got a 720 on my SAT verbal. Copious.
Verisimilitude.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Intransigence.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Regurgitation.</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: Oh, gross.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesus, what did you eat?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Stifler, how’s the man chowder?!</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: He likes it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Of course he does. What about you? Have you
just never had one with Kevin – or have you never had one, period?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I think I’ve had one.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well that’s a no. No wonder you’re not
psyched about sex. You’ve never even had one manually?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: …I’ve never tried it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Are you kidding? You’ve never double-
clicked your mouse?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Hell, just a pair of tight pants will set
me off. Am I right or what, Nadia?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You are right. The hands are not always
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: In fact – I should teach you my own special
method. I developed it myself at the ballet institute in Prague. You use
nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No wonder she never pays attention in
class.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Shit, I can’t believe a fine woman like this
produced a guy like Stifler.</p>
<p><strong>freshman guy</strong>: Dude! That chick – is a MILF!</p>
<p><strong>freshman guy #2</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>freshman guy</strong>: M-I-L-F! Mom I’d Like to Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Don’t you think you fellas could try a
little tact? I’ve got company. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Dammit! If Sherman has sex before I do, I’m
gonna be really fucking pissed.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Man, I just gotta get laid already! This
blowjob thing is bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Jessica, can you drive me home?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Vicky, wait.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Not for you.</p>
<p><strong>party guy</strong>: Yeti! I am the Yeti!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Ow, what the hell?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sorry, I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Good morning gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Finch! Where were you last night? What happened
to the foolproof plan?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I thought a fashionably late entrance would
enhance my appearance. When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the
nymphs had left.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Feeling better, Oz?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I’m such a loser.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: …I’ll never forget…thank you.</p>
<p><strong>central girl</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You did it.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the
boy. I am now a man.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I highly recommend you join the club.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I – I don’t get it, how the hell did you do
that?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It was just my time, fellas, it was just my
time. Best of luck to you, boys.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I put in months of quality time with Vicky.
Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores? This is just wrong.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: No shit, I’m never gonna get laid. How the hell
am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesus, we’re all gonna go to college as
virgins. They’ve probably got special dorms for people like us.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Alright, I got an idea. But it stays between
us. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Like a bet?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No, a pact. No money involved. This is more
important than any bet. Now here’s the deal: We all get laid before we
graduate.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dude, it’s not like I haven’t been trying to get
laid.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This is different. This is better. Think of
when you’re working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.
Someone to keep you motivated.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s what we are, we keep each other on
track. Prior to this day, we’ve postured. We’ve procrastinated. We’ve
pretended. We’ve – well I can’t think of other p-words, but we’ve
probably done them too.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Pontificated.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. But
together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our
dragon style will defeat it!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: The Sha-lin masters from east and west must
unite!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Guys, guys – you’re ruining my fucking moment
here. Now think about it –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No longer will our penises remain flaccid and
unused! From now on, we fight for every man out there who isn’t getting
laid when he should be! This is our day! This is our time! And, by God,
we’re not gonna let history condemn us to celibacy! We will make a
stand! We will succeed! We will get laid!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: What the hell are you losers doing?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: If I might ask, when you brush your teeth, do
you spit or swallow?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Now, the sex – it’s got to be valid,
consensual sex. No funny stuff. And no prostitutes, if you were thinking
about that, Finch.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So, I’m thinking prom is basically our last
big chance.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dude, prom sucks.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I know, but think about it – At the parties
that night. Chicks are gonna want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, it’s like tradition or something.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Right. That gives us…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Exactly three weeks to the day.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Alright then. It’s official. Any
questions?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: To the next step.</p>
<p><strong>date</strong>: We Make Love Happen.” As Jim fiddles with the
camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image. He clicks an
onscreen-button labeled “FREEZE IMAGE” – the image freezes, showing Jim
with an awkward grimace. The screen reads, “IMAGE SENT.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: You’re not…busy?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad, come in.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Sit down, Jim. Let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: These are for you. From father to
son.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh…dad…</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Go ahead son, there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Oh, okay. Here’s let me show you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad! I know!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Do you know about the clitoris?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes dad.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Sometimes it can be pretty hard to
locate.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Thank you, dad, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Okay, well that about covers it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: I’ll have to save this speech for another
day. I’m too worn out.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Did you get the flowers? What about the
poem?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Ah, you’ll get her back soon enough. That’s
easy, she likes you. What you need to do is learn to press a girl’s
buttons. You gotta give her what she’s never had.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’ll give you a hint. “Ohhh, yeah, yeah!”
Comprende?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You mean…and orgasm?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You got it, stud.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Well…I’m pretty sure I’ve –</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No you haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: But that one time –</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Well of course I’d want to give her that. I
mean, what do you think, I don’t care about her?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Do you love her?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I – I don’t know, you can’t ask me that.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well, if you want to get her in the sack,
tell her you love her. That’s how I was duped.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say
it, I have to be sure I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well it’s up to you. The Big L, or the Big
O.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Dickhead! You gotta see this.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This is unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: What did you cocks do to him? Shit, if
Coach Marshall sees this, he’ll kick Oz off the team on principle
alone.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: I think you need your balls reattached.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Keep it down, dude.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: This place is an untapped resource. Check it
out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot.</p>
<p><strong>vocal jazz girl #1</strong>: Hey, we’ve got Conan the
Barbarian singing with us.</p>
<p><strong>vocal jazz girl #2</strong>: Maybe he’ll crush some beer cans
on his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I think he’s got a nice voice.</p>
<p><strong>vocal jazz girl #1</strong>: Go talk to him, maybe you can
teach him how to read.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: You dipshit, you’re expecting to score with
some goody-goody choir-girl priss?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs
like me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This is your plan, Finch?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re just gonna sit there and drink your
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Mochaccino. Actually, in the spirit of the
pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Of course, Finch. What?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Whatever you hear about me, you agree.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What are we gonna hear?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: You’ll see. Gotta go. Sixteen minute round
trip.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Finch, don’t you think it’s about time you
learned to take a dump at school?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: When was the last time you looked at the
facilities here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Fifteen minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>enthralled girl</strong>: Uh, guys? Was that Paul Finch?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>enthralled girl</strong>: You guys have like, seen him in the
locker room, right?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>enthralled girl</strong>: Is it true that he’s
really…huge?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I have no idea. Finch showers in a bathing
suit.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No – it’s true. He is…really… big.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, enormous.</p>
<p><strong>enthralled girl</strong>: Woah. Does he have a date for prom
yet.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>enthralled girl</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Finch hasn’t done a damn thing, and he’s got
girls lining up already.</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Say that again, Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Uh…I thought you might know a trick or
something. To make her, you know…</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Orgasm?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sushi customer</strong>: What’s good here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Try the spicy tuna hand roll.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What?! How do I do that?</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: Uh – forget that. Look, is that all
you’re interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Well, no. I think…I guess it would be good to
be able to return the favor. I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: That’s good, that’s what I needed
to hear. Now you qualify.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Qualify for what?</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: You’ve just inherited The
Bible.</p>
<p><strong>kevin’s brother</strong>: It originally started as a sex
manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam in the
early eighties. What to do with your tongue, things like that. And each
year, it got passed on to one East student who was worthy of it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mom?! I’m home!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s not what it looks like!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: I guess…we’ll just tell your mother…that
we ate it all.</p>
<p><strong>choir teacher</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>choir teacher</strong>: No, it was good.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Oh, well… It came from the heart.</p>
<p><strong>choir teacher</strong>: Well then keep it coming. Alright,
people, good work! Keep it up and we’ll do great at the state
competition.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Not bad, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Really? Hey, thanks – Heather, right?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah…so…you’ve got this sort of… Bobby
McFerrin thing going there.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Yeah. Right, uh-huh. I feel like I’ve discovered
this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Okay. I mean, I agree, but…aren’t you
supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your
lacrosse stick or something?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Oh sure. I know what people think. It’s like,
Oz, he’s just this kickass lacrosse player – I also play football, by
the way – But that’s like…not all that I am.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Of course, I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I mean it really bothers me when people try to
pigeonhole me like that.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You? You think I don’t get that? God, it’s
like just because I don’t get drunk and barf every weekend, people say
“Oh, here’s this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss.”</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Yeah…so like, what else do you do?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well the same things you do. Hang out with
friends and stuff, you know, whatever. What do you think I do?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I just – realized that I didn’t know anything
about you. I was interested.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh…well that’s okay. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive.
And I’m a total idiot.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I think “shithead” really says it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yes! I’m a shithead! I’m a complete and total
shithead!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: And I want to try to make it up to you.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Oh…ungghhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Shhhh. Your parents are downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Oh Kevin – don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Just a second!</p>
<p><strong>vicky’s mom</strong>: Hon? Can you tell Vick to come on down
for supper?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Vicky, shhh, you know there’s no lock on your
door.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, dad. Did you knock?</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Oh, Jim! I’m looking at the ol’ family
portrait, here. Yep. It’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Son, I wanted to talk to you about what I
think you were trying to do the other day.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Now, you may have tried it in the shower,
or maybe in bed at night, and not even known what you were doing. Or
perhaps you’ve heard your friends talking about it in the locker
room.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad, please stop. Please. I’m sure I know what
you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Sure you know, son, but I think you’ve
been having a little problem with it. It’s okay, though. What you’re
doing is perfectly normal. It’s like practice. Like when you play tennis
against a wall. Some day, there’ll be a partner returning the ball. You
do want a partner, don’t you son?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: That’s great. Now remember, it’s okay to
play with yourself. Or, as I always called it – “Stroke the salami!”
Ho-ho, Jim. There’s nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I’m fifty-two, and I
still enjoy masturbating. Uncle Mort masturbates. We all masturbate.</p>
<p><strong>coach marshall</strong>: Good work, Ostreicher.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Thanks coach.</p>
<p><strong>coach marshall</strong>: You’re a killer, Ozzy!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: – Thanks, coach –</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Hey, what’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Just enjoying my exhilarating first
lacrosse experience. You like, “kicked butt.”</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Whoops, excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Um…Chris –</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You can call me Oz.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You can call me Ostreicher.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s your middle name?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Come on! I won’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Neither will I.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Okay. So I had this…thought, and…this may
seem like it’s out of left field, and I don’t know if you can, but since
I’m not going with anyone –</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Hah! Central sucks! Choir Chick? What the
hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well, I uh, I was – I was asking Chris to
prom. So do you wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Well, just don’t expect Oz to pay for the
limo.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Stifler, fuck – …man, you don’t have to be so
insensitive.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: What?? Whatever – look uh, don’t forget –
my cottage after prom. On Lake Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Alright, cool. I gotta hit the showers, but…I
think this’ll be really good.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah, me too, okay, cool.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: My man Oz, working it with the choir
babes?</p>
<p><strong>lacrosse buddies</strong>: Yeah, go Oz! etc.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute
little sweaters she wears.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: I’ll bet you do, you little horndog, she’s
givin’ you fuckin’ stiffies, right?</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Yeah! Sing for me! yes!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: So once Hal becomes king, he has to take on
the responsibilities of leadership, and turn his back on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff. You see, Hal was going through a rite of
passage, much like you all are. Make the most of the time you’ve got
left together. You’ll miss it later.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: So does your tongue cramp up?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wow, that’s amazing, she’s probably gonna want
to do it soon.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Still questing after the holy grail, eh
guys?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, where’s Finch?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Went home to shit.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t get it. How does a guy like that get
this sudden reputation?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: What reputation?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Observe.</p>
<p><strong>random cute girl</strong>: Of course! Have you guys seen his
tattoo?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: …Yes?</p>
<p><strong>random cute girl</strong>: Is it cool? I heard it was like an
eagle, blazing in fire and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Actually, it’s an eagle and this big
python.</p>
<p><strong>random cute girl</strong>: Really?!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, see it’s on his stomach, here, and the
eagle – the eagle is actually grasping the python in its talons, so the
snake is like his –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s good, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>random cute girl</strong>: Woah, no way! That guy is so
cool!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Okay, explain.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I can’t, I have no idea how he’s doing it.
And that leaves you trailing, Jim. You gotta get your act together.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, I know. I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You are very good in the world history class,
yes?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes. No. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Perhaps you can help me with my studies?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay…that would be cool sometime. How ’bout
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I
can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your
place?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I suppose that would be okay.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Nice car.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m glad you think so.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You don’t like it?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, I like the car. By the way, though,
about prom? That was like a bad idea. Sorry I invited you.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, please. I asked you because I thought
you might actually be worth going with. But you are just a jock. No
wait. You’re a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: What? No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I saw you making fun of me with your
lacrosse buddies.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I wasn’t making fun of you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Give me a break, you’re so full of it.</p>
<p><strong>choir teacher</strong>: Okay, Heather, that was good, but I
want to thicken up that solo. Michigan State is this Saturday, and I
want that part to smoke.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I know, my timing’s off.</p>
<p><strong>choir teacher</strong>: A little, but I think it’ll work
better as a duet. With a tenor part.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>choir teacher</strong>: Okay then. The rest of you okay with
that?</p>
<p><strong>choir teacher</strong>: Great. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Because I want to.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah? Well you can’t fake your way through
this. You better practice.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Fuck me! You’re gonna have a naked
Eastern-European chick in your house, and you’re telling me you’re not
gonna take advantage of that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What am I gonna do, broadcast her over the
internet?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You can do that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh – no way. I can’t do that to her.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Dammit, Jim, get some fucking balls. If you
don’t have the guts to photograph a naked chick in your room, how are
you ever gonna sleep with one? Now all you gotta do is set up some sort
of private link or whatever on the net, and tell me the address.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You can send me the address too.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well…dammit, if I’m doing this, how the hell am
I gonna watch?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll save you a seat.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: “You have established an internet
connection.”</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: There we go.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Son. This lady’s here for you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know. Hey Nadia.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Hello James. Ready to study.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Oh, you bet he is. Jim’s quite the
bookworm.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He’s
a good little kid. Er, guy. Man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad!!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s dad</strong>: Okay, okay. I’ll let you hit those
books.</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s brother</strong>: Steve! Steve! It’s my computer
and I wanna use it!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Shut up and watch this, you might learn
something.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So you need to change, right?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Do you mind? This fabric is so
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, go right ahead and get dressed. I’ll just
be downstairs, studying up. Get me when you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Be back in a sec!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s mom</strong>: Jim? Honey, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Want a beer?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did I miss anything?!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Just in time.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Woah!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh, man! This is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I can’t believe Oz had to work.</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s brother</strong>: This is like the coolest thing
I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, thank you Lord, for this wonderful day.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Nice collection there, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dear God – she’s – she’s – she’s –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You know, Jim…you could go back
there…and…</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Seduce her.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But, but – what would I do?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Anything! Just tell her it looks like she
needs an extra hand or something.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No, you’re stupid. Get going! Right now!
She’s primed!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh…oh…oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey mom hey dad!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Come on, Jim. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Jim must’ve addressed that E-mail wrong. It
went out to every mailbox in the East High directory. God, how
juvenile.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #1</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: Kind.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Please, God. Let this be it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He’s going in!</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: There’s somebody going in there!</p>
<p><strong>stoner #1</strong>: Hey, that guy’s in my trig class.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Looks like you could use an extra hand.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: James! You have come in here on purpose?!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well…uh…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Shame on you!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh…yeah…sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Well. You have seen me. Now it is my turn to
see you. Strip.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Strip?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes, slowly.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You mean like, strip strip?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: What do you suppose they’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Move with the music.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Um…okay…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No, no, you must put your whole body into
it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nadia, I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Can’t what? Do you not want to be with me? I
wish to be entertained, James.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: The horror, the horror.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: God, what a buzzkill.</p>
<p><strong>girl in bedroom</strong>: Work it, baby!</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: More sexy, Jim, more sexy.</p>
<p><strong>disinterested girl</strong>: He’s no Paul Finch.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: This is truly revolting.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: More, more, you bad boy!</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: Ugh…God…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Now! Hames, come to me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh yeah!</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Be gentle.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Ho-lee shit.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: This just got a hell of a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Jim…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #1</strong>: Bummer.</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s brother</strong>: What happened?! What
happened?!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: He blew it. Literally.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You are done, James. Perhaps I should be
going now.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, no, I’m not done! I’ve got reserves! Nadia,
please please please. I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I do like your dirty magazines.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did you see this? This is your more exotic
dirty magazine.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes…James, it is knowing that these beautiful
women arouse you that arouses me…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh yes. Very arousing women. They arouse me
very much. But not as arousing as you.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Oh Jim…</p>
<p><strong>kevin/finch</strong>: Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>stoner #1</strong>: Alright, dude!</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: He’s re-engaging!</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: So, “shaved” is the expression?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Touch me Jim…here.</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Not again.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, not again.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I am sorry, Jim. I suppose we will not be
doing any studying now.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No! I’ve got…reserve reserves!</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It is too bad. I was at first hoping you
would ask me to the prom. But…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …okay.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: “You have lost your internet
connection. Click ‘okay’ to reconnect.”</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hey, minuteman.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Shut up. You’re supposed to be supportive.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You’ve still got a chance with Nadia, right?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.
I don’t think they liked it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: She’s already on a plane back home.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah? Well come prom night, those excuses
aren’t going to do you much good.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: And so, one time? I was at band camp? And
we weren’t supposed to have pillow fights? But we had a pillow fight!
And it was so much fun!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hold on. You have no idea why I’m angry?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, that’s pretty much it.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I thought so. Because, one time? I was at
this –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What was your name again?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for
the prom?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Really? You seriously want to go with
me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Are we going to Steve Stifler’s party
afterwards? That would be so cool.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Cool! We’re gonna have so much fun! It’s
like this one time, at band camp…</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re not doing the extra credit
problems.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: No, I’m not. I’m writing a sequence of random
numbers that look like I’m doing the extra credit problems. Mr. Bender
doesn’t bother to check homework past April.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s my trick!</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: It’s everyone’s trick, Kevin. But I did pick
it up from you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We’ve come a long way since Homecoming.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Yeah, we have. You corrupted my four- point
into a three-nine-five.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It’s
progressed a lot. It’s time for us to…express ourselves in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Like how?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Well, I feel that…things are getting to that
point in a relationship. When two people share…a special moment between
them.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I think you’re so right, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You want to do it?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Kevin? Do you not love me?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No, I don’t not love you. I like, I know that
we’ve definitely got something between us. Something good. Something
special.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: But you don’t love me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I didn’t say that. I mean, love, it’s like a
term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have
kids, and then what? It’s like they call it off, going “I was
wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Kevin…you’re not your dad. The two of us,
we’re not your parents.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I know, Vick. I’m just not ready yet,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: How did you know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Stifler told me.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You talked to Stifler?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well…I needed to find you. We are gonna
have to practice that song.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: …okay. Cool then. I’m um, I’m glad you came by.
I mean, really.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: So you like, work nights?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Uh…my dad’s the manager.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Really? Cool. Tell him his subs are
great.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Ah, he’s always too heavy on the vinegar. If you
really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: My dad’s always here running the store, busy and
stuff…and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: So you’re going to Michigan?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to
Northwestern. I didn’t want to write all those extra essays they make
you do – I mean, how am I supposed to know what my “most emotionally
significant moment” was? So when my U of M acceptance came in December,
I said the hell with it.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Onions?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You want onions?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, yeah. So what’re you gonna major
in?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Well, State’s got a good business school. And I
can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah. So wow, you’ve got it figured
out.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is
awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player? I really have no
idea.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh thank God, I thought I was the only
one.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Well, you’re not. Oil and vinegar?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah. You know, people are always like,
“What’re you gonna major in?” And I don’t know. And they’re like,
“You’ll figure it out.” Yeah? When?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I know. Salt and pepper?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: So we’re gonna be close next year?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You – oh, you mean – yeah, East Lansing and Ann
Arbor.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: …yeah.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Wanna swap your chips for cookies?</p>
<p><strong>girl holding out for finch</strong>: I’m sorry, I really
can’t go with you…I’m holding out for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: You gotta be fucking kidding.</p>
<p><strong>girl holding out for finch</strong>: I know it’s a long shot,
but I figure Paul Finch might ask me.</p>
<p><strong>girl holding out for finch</strong>: Oh gosh, I forgot – you
uh, you look okay…I mean you can’t even tell…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hey…what was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>girl holding out for finch</strong>: He’s still embarrassed
because Finch kicked his ass. Knocked out a tooth, but you can’t see
it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Right, and who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No comment.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I’ve never
seen someone’s image change so…so drastically!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Thanks. It was my idea.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Did you guys hook up or something?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Are you kidding? No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Then what the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well…I guess it’s okay for me to tell you
now. That reputation of his isn’t going anywhere. Finch comes to me and
says, “Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera.” So I told
him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I’ll tell a couple girls that you’re
dynamite in bed. So he did, and I did.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t get it, that really works?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a
little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older
woman?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No? Damn, that one was my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: …I needed the shelter of someone’s arms…there
you were – woo-hoo- hoo…</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: …I needed someone to understand my ups and my
downs, oh baby there you were…</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Oh my fucking God. You’re gay.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Come on, you know the words, sing along.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: No thanks, you’ve been singing that shit
all week. If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I’m pretending I don’t
know you.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Our last game is this Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: …I’ve got this lacrosse game. It’s really
important, it’s our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last
time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it’s like cool because
we’re gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I
might be able to stop by…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You can’t sing at the competition.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I’m sorry, I totally spaced. I just…I didn’t
realize it…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: …it’s okay, you should do whatever makes
you happy.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Alright…yeah…thanks for understanding. So I
guess…I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Kevin! You seen Shitbreak lately?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: Me? Nothing. I’m the one whose ass he
kicked. I’ll tell you one thing, though. I don’t think he’s gonna have a
problem shitting in school anymore.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Easy, tiger. What’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Just go!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Why is this?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re gonna shit your pants!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Finch, listen – Stifler slipped some sort of
laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It’s fast acting. I mean
really fast.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: First of all, it’s Mochaccino, and
secondly…Oohhhh!</p>
<p><strong>stifler</strong>: This way, sit.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Come on come on come on…</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Okay. You can do this.</p>
<p><strong>girl holding out for finch</strong>: You know it’s just gonna
be some crappy band and stupid decorations.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: You’re just saying that cause prom’s a week
away and you don’t have a date.</p>
<p><strong>girl holding out for finch</strong>: No, I don’t want a date…
Finch is going stag…and so am I…the guy is like so…debonair.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Do you think that “older woman” thing is
true?</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: Of course, it was Stifler’s mom.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Joanie, was that you?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh!</p>
<p><strong>vocal jazz teacher</strong>: Okay. Albert, you ready?</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: No problemo.</p>
<p><strong>coach marshall</strong>: Alright! Good hustle, guys, but we
can still lose. You all saw what happened to Oz out there. I don’t ever
want to see you guys thinking you’re gonna score. You don’t score until
you score, period.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Focus on the music. Think melody. Let the
music be my guide.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That would be a start.</p>
<p><strong>coach marshall</strong>: It all boils down to today. For you
seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years. Think of
what that means to you. Are you guys gonna look back on your days at
East and know that you made the most of the time you had?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Good luck, guys.</p>
<p><strong>coach marshall</strong>: Christ! I didn’t say you were out of
the game!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Sorry, coach.</p>
<p><strong>coach marshall</strong>: What the fuck is this? You got
someplace more important to be?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vocal jazz guys</strong>: Oz – You’re back – Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: – Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What about the game?!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I’m not playing.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’re missing the game for us?!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: No. I’m missing the game for you.</p>
<p><strong>vocal jazz teacher</strong>: Okay, okay. You guys got about a
minute to go. Spend it warming up, not making out. This ain’t the prom
yet.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You fuckin’ rule!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Did you know that it’s…450 miles from Ann
Arbor to Nashville?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s like a six or seven hour drive. That’s
easy, I don’t mind driving.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: About the other day…I’ve been thinking.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: So have I. And I know you want to make things
perfect for me. And I understand that you really wouldn’t tell me that
until you were 100% comfortable with it.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: And I want to make things perfect for you.
You’re right, Kev, we do have something good…and special.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah, we have something great, Vick.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Kevin… I want to have sex with you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Now?!</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: No…I know the perfect time…</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You know, at band camp? We have dances
like this. Only they’re way funner. Don’t you think prom is just highly
overrated?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Highly, highly overrated.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Okay. I’m here for your dumb…dumb
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m on the offensive, boys. The Sherman
Tank is going back in.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Locked on target, flying in stealth mode
under enemy sex radar. Ready to drop the payload…again.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Alright, how do you guys stand? Well, Finch,
I know where you are, but you can’t use that as an excuse. Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: My date’s a flute-toting band dork. That answer
your question?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oz, how about you and Heather? Now you guys
are a couple or something?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dammit, Kevin, what’s with the attitude?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Attitude? Me? I think that you guys should be
more enthusiastic. Shit, we’ve been trying to get laid forever, and
tonight’s the night we’ve been waiting for. We’re in this together.
Don’t back out on me now!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Back out? You don’t need us to get laid. You
afraid or something?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No, but come on guys, we made a pact!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Kevin, it was just a –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It was a pact. You break it and there are no
excuses. You guys have to –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t have to do shit! Forget it already!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: At least I learned how to shit in school.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Hey, Finch. Wanna dance?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: How come you have no date?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I like to keep my options open. And let me
just clarify that you have no chance of scoring with me, Finch.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: No, of course not, don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: So, I guess you and Sherman are pretty close.
You met at that party a while back?</p>
<p><strong>central girl</strong>: Yeah, we were up the whole night
together. We had one of those amazingly deep conversations, where you
really feel like you get to know someone.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: “Deep conversation,” huh? Is that what you
guys call it?</p>
<p><strong>central girl</strong>: What else would I call it?</p>
<p><strong>central girl</strong>: Excuse me, everyone, sorry to
interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: …Guess what?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler’s is gonna
be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This isn’t how I wanted things to turn out.
Making the pact wasn’t just about getting laid. It was about doing one
last thing with you guys before we graduated. But now I’ve just wasted
my last few weeks here trying to do what? I don’t even know. All I
managed to do was fuck up our friendship.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I still think you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So do I, Kev.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Me too. For the most part.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Nah. Fuck, you guys are right, I don’t know
what I’m doing. I mean I’m acting like I’ve got it all together tonight.
But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her. And I don’t know what
I’m gonna say. So now it’s like, maybe I’ll just wimp out on the whole
thing.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on man. Tonight is the night. We’re
finally going to a post-prom party on the lake. We’ve been waiting to do
this for the last four years. Why else are we still friends with
Stifler? You gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: And by the way, Sherman didn’t even get
laid.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Nope. He pissed himself.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There it is. I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my
date.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Come on, Kevin. Vicky’s looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Stifler’s mom got it in the divorce.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It reminds me of this one time – Hey, can
I ask you a question? How come you don’t have any stories? I’ve got lots
of stories, and you don’t have any.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, I’ve got stories, believe me. They’re a
little more risque than tales of Band Camp.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Are they gross or something, like guy
stuff? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay. You want a story? Here’s a story. Stifler
finds this beer, right? And…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: See – this is the nicest room.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Wow, Kev…it’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s brother</strong>: You guys are gonna fuck, aren’t
you!?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s brother</strong>: Fuckers fuckers fuckers
fuckers!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you,
Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: It’s gonna sound really bad, but I want you to
know.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: This isn’t the best way to proposition
me.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: No, that’s not what I mean. I mean – look. You
know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about
not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: This isn’t any better, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: No, see Heather, what I realized is that…with
you, it’s not like I’m running towards the goal, trying to figure out
the best way to score. And this may sound corny, but –</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oz, it’s okay, I know.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: You called me Oz.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well, that’s what your friends call you. I
mean…I feel like I’m one of your friends now…and also…your
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: Dieter. My middle name is Dieter.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hmm. You know that’s really a shitty middle
name!</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I know, it sucks!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Ah, Stifler’s mom! Thank you for letting us
have a great party.</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s mom</strong>: As if there were any alternative in
the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I’m three sheets to the wind, ma’am!</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s mom</strong>: I’m so happy for you. Takes the edge
off, doesn’t it? And where might your date be?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Oh no, no date. Bathroom incident.</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s mom</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: …Nevermind. You have anything to drink?</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s mom</strong>: I believe the kegs are upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: No, no, that’s what the cretins drink. I mean
alcohol, liquor – good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s mom</strong>: All right, I got some scotch.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Single malt?</p>
<p><strong>stifler’s mom</strong>: Aged eighteen years. Why don’t you
get the glasses. Behind the bar.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: That is a nasty story!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It’s
kind of sexual.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, bring it on!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Well, this one time? At band camp? We were
playing this game, I don’t know if you know it? But it’s called spin the
bottle? And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?
And…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Yeah, are you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: You sure you’re comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Okay. Did you bring a condom?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah, right here.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So, do you want to be – I mean, how do you
want to do it?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I don’t know. How do you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Like, normal style. The…missionary
position.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah Vick?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I want to hear you say it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Victoria…I love you.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>oz</strong>: I can’t think of anything to say that’s not
cheesy.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Then don’t.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So, the end of the story is…you had to kiss the
guy for twenty seconds?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Yes! And he was such a dork! And everyone
laughed at me, but I didn’t care? Because it was so funny!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay, I get it.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Oh! And then this one time? At band camp?
I stuck a flute in my pussy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …excuse me?!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What, you think I don’t know how to get
myself off? Hell, that’s what half of band camp is! Sex ed!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both,

<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Kevin, next year…with you in Ann Arbor, and
me in Nashville…it’s not gonna work, is it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Don’t say that, we can do it somehow. It
might not be perfect, but –</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: No, Kevin – That’s the whole thing, that’s
what I’ve been realizing. That nothing’s perfect, that you can’t plan
everything.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It is far away…and we’ll be on our
own…meeting new people…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Vicky…last night…I wasn’t lying.</p>

<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I’ll tell you, I’ve learned one thing: women,
like wine, get better with age. Of course, I have no frame of reference
for this comparison.</p>
