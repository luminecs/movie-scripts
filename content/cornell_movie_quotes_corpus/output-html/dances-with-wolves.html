<p><strong>may 23, 1989</strong>: Final Draft</p>
<p><strong>surgeon 1</strong>: Is this the last one?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon 2</strong>: God, what a mess… at least there’s no
gangrene.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon 1</strong>: There will be if it doesn’t come off.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon 2</strong>: Well I can’t saw if I can’t keep my eyes
open. Let’s coffee up… he can wait a few more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Lieutenant… izat you?</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: What’re you doing here lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: This is where I belong… this is my
outfit.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: You went to hospital?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It was no good… what’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Better come to cover lieutenant… those boys
are shooters.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: What’s goin’ on here… seems to be the
question alright… you could ask the major but he don’t know. He’s busy
tryin’ to figger out how come the officer’s mess run outta peach ice
cream…</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: General’s come up to see the show but all he
knows is there ain’t no show…</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: We started a balloon up but they shot her
down fore she was ten feet off the ground… so nobody’s made a run either
way. It’s been a stand- off all damn day… and now… the major, he’s
lookin’ at the general and he’s thinkin’ I better do somethin’, and you
know what that means…</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: They’re ’sposed to be beat up just like us
but everybody knows that Tucker’s men are tough as cobs. I sure don’t
wanna die out there with them cows.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Some of the boys are sayin’ that if we ain’t
gonna fight we could just settle the whole business with a little high
stakes poker. Wouldn’t that be a sight… a bunch of fellas sittin’ in the
middle of this field drawin’ cards…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Tucker!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: What is it sir?</p>
<p><strong>tide</strong>: Looks like a suicide.</p>
<p><strong>confederate</strong>: Come on you son of a bitch – you won’t
make it a second time…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Alright by me.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Forgive me Father.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Don’t take off my foot.</p>
<p><strong>general tide</strong>: You rest easy son… you’ll keep you’re
foot. As God is my judge, you’ll keep it.</p>
<p><strong>general tide</strong>: Bring up my ambulance…</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>general tide</strong>: Bring up my ambulance. And bring my
surgeon with it. We’ve got an officer who’s worth something lying
here.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: The strangeness of this life cannot be
measured. In trying to produce my own death, I was elevated to the
status of a living hero.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Where can I find Major… Fambrough?</p>
<p><strong>elgin</strong>: Turn right… all the way to the end of the
hall.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Lt. John J. Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Lt. John J. Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes sir?</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Indian fighter, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Your orders say you are to be posted on
the frontier. The frontier is Indian country. I quickly deduced that you
are an Indian fighter.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: I did not ascend to this position by
being stupid.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: It says here you’ve been decorated.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: And they sent you out here to be
posted?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Actually sir, I’m here at my own request… I
want to see the frontier.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: You want to see the frontier?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes sir… before it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Such a smart lad coming straight to
me.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Sir Knight, I am sending you on a
knight’s errand. You will report to Captain Cargill at the furthermost
outpost of the realm… Fort Sedgewick.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: My personal seal will assure you safe
passage through many miles of wild hostile country.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’m wondering sir, how will I be getting
there?</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: You think I don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: No sir, it’s just that I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Hold your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: I’m in a generous mood and will grant
your boon. You see that peasant… he calls himself Timmons… he leaves
this very afternoon for your Fort Sedgewick. Ride with him if you like…
he knows the way. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Sir Knight…</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: I just pissed in my pants… and nobody can
do anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Noooo, noooo…</p>
<p><strong>elgin</strong>: It’s alright Major.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Leave him alone lieutenant… he’s
cracked.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Nooo, nooo…</p>
<p><strong>elgin</strong>: Don’t sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: Are you deaf fool. I said I’ll have my
crown this instant… this instant!</p>
<p><strong>elgin</strong>: Let’s have the pistol.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>fambrough</strong>: The king is dead… long live the king.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Were it not for my companion I believe I
would be having the time of my life. He is quite possibly the foulest
person I have ever met.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: We have been gone four days now and still we
have seen no signs of life. Only earth and sky.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: How far do you make the fort?</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Far.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Forty or fifty miles, maybe… what’s the big
hurry on Sedgewick?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It’s going to be my post… my home.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: You ain’t hard to please, I’ll say
that.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Look yonder.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Somebody back east is sayin’… “why don’t he
write?” Stupid bastard.</p>
<p><strong>cargill</strong>: Corporal Guest… Corporal Guest… Corporal
Guest. Corporal Guest, you don’t have to talk to me… just please come
out.</p>
<p><strong>cargill</strong>: It’s the end… assemble the men in front of
my quarters.</p>
<p><strong>cargill</strong>: You hate me… but I feel none of the same
for you… you men stayed. You stayed after they took all our horses. You
stayed after all the others deserted. You stayed on the promise that the
army would resupply us. I’ve looked for that wagon from Fort Hays just
as you have… day after miserable day. All I can say is that I’m proud of
you. Get your things men, we’re leaving this place. The army… can go to
hell.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Timmons… Timmons.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Timmons.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Something’s out there…</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Somethin’ dead.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Might have a look.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Might stay clear of whatever did the
killin’.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: How come we haven’t seen any buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Can’t figger the stinkin’ buffalo.
Sometimes you don’t see ’em for days, sometimes they’re thick as curls
on a whore.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: What about Indians?</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Goddamn Indians you’d jus’ as soon not see,
lessen the bastards’re dead. Nothing but thieves and beggars.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Not what you’d call a going concern.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Ain’t nothin’ here lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Everybody’s run off… or got kilt.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Alright…lets unload the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: What, and leave it all here?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’m staying too… we don’t know what’s
happened.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: There ain’t nothin’ here lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Not at the moment, no.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: So things bein’ the way they are we might
as well turn around and get started back.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: This is my post…</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: This is my… are you crazy boy?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: This is my post! And these are the post’s
provisions. Now get your ass off that wagon and help me unload.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Well… I’ll let ’em know where you are.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: Good luck lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick
deserted. Am now waiting for the garrison’s return or word from
headquarters. Post is in exceedingly poor condition. Have decided to
assign myself clean-up duty beginning tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The
country is everything I dreamed it would be. There can be no place like
this on earth.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Damn… damn.</p>
<p><strong>the toughest</strong>: Only a white man would make a fire for
everyone to see.</p>
<p><strong>1st pawnee</strong>: Maybe there’s more than one.</p>
<p><strong>2nd pawnee</strong>: We have no rifles. White men are sure to
have rifles.</p>
<p><strong>3rd pawnee</strong>: We should forget this and go home.</p>
<p><strong>toughest</strong>: Then go. I for one, will not debate the
merit of a single line of smoke in my own country.</p>
<p><strong>1st pawnee</strong>: He will not quit until we are all
dead.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: No sign of Captain Cargill’s command. I
don’t know what to do. Communication can only take place if I leave and
I don’t want to abandon my post.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Made a short patrol yesterday p.m…
discovered nothing. Will go further tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: There is a wolf who seems intent on the
goings on here. He does not seem inclined to be a nuisance however and
aside from Cisco has been my only company. He has appeared each
afternoon for the past two days. He has milky white socks on both feet.
If he comes calling tomorrow I will name him Two Socks.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Almost a month and no one has come. The
longer this condition persists, the less inclined I am to believe that
anyone will. Rain has forced me indoors for most of two days. I have
begun an awning. The work has ruined my hands, but I am excited about
the improvement it will bring to this place.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It is the loneliest of times… but I cannot
say that I am unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You there!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Have made first contact with a wild Indian.
One came to the fort and tried to steal my horse. Do not know how many
more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation.
Am burying excess ordnance, lest it fall into enemy hands.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Have made all the preparations I can think
of. I cannot mount an adequate defense but will try to make a big
impression when they come. Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: The man I encountered was a magnificent
looking fellow.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days. I do not like to see our medicine man walking so
alone.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: What does his wife say?</p>
<p><strong>pretty shield</strong>: He is keeping to himself.</p>
<p><strong>pretty shield</strong>: That’s what she says.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Make sure that meat is soft… my teeth
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: No, no let him sit with me.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Our country seems good this summer, but I
have not been out to see it.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Yes… it is good. The grass is rich.
The game is plenty and not running away.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo are
late. I always worry about the bellies of our children.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I was thinking of a dance.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Yes, a dance is always a good idea. It
would be good to have a strong sign.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: There’s a funny thing about signs. They
are always flying in our faces. We know when they are bad or good but
sometimes they are strange and there is no way to understand them.
Sometimes they make people crazy but a smart man will take such a sign
into himself and let it run around for two or three days. If he is still
confused he will tell somebody. He might come to you or to me and tell
it. A smart man always does that.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I have seen such a sign.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I saw a man, a white man.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Just one?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Just one. He was naked.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Are you sure it was a man?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I saw his sex.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Did you speak to him?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: We will council on this.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: He might be a god or he might be a
special chief – that’s why we are thinking of having a talk with
him.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: I do not care for this talk about
a white man. Whatever kind of white man he is, he is not Sioux and that
makes him less. We’ve camped here for ten days now and each day our
scouts find nothing. One old bull with wolves tearing him apart, nothing
more. We need meat – not talk.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: You are right, we need meat today and
tomorrow. But we must also have meat in ten years.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: But the whites are coming. Our friends
the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our enemies, agree on this – the whites
are coming. More than can be counted.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Kicking Bird is always looking
ahead and that is good. But when I hear that more whites are coming –
more than can be counted I want to laugh. We took a hundred horses from
these people, there was no honor in it. They don’t ride well, they don’t
shoot well, they’re dirty. They have no women, no children. They could
not even make it through one winter in our country. And these people are
said to flourish? I think they will all be dead in ten years.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: I think this white man is probably
lost.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Wind In His Hair has spoken straight,
his words are strong and I have heard them. It’s true the whites are a
poor race and it’s hard to understand them. But when I see one white man
alone, without fear in our country, I do not think he is lost. I think
he may have medicine. I see someone who might speak for all the white
people who are coming. I think this is a person with which treaties
might be struck.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: This white man cannot cover our
lodges, or string our bows, or feed our children. I will take some good
men… there are many here tonight. We will ride to the soldier fort, we
will shoot some arrows into this white man. If he truly has medicine he
will not be hurt. If he has no medicine he will be dead.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: It is easy to become confused by these
questions. It is hard to know what to do. No man can tell another how he
will be. But I know this… killing a white man is a delicate matter. If
you kill one, more are sure to come. We should talk about this some
more.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: What’s the matter now?</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Otter doesn’t want to go.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: If we take the horse of a white god
they will make up songs about us.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: They will ask us to go on raids.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: Who gets the white god horse?</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: I do… but we share… you and Worm can
ride him too. Who can say this is not a great plan?</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: Let me take him Otter.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: I have him.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: I don’t know. My arm doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: You shouldn’t have fallen down… now
we’ll get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: It was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: My idea was only to take the
horse.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: Otter hurt himself.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: You’re not hurt… I’m hurt.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: I will be when my father finds out, his bow
will be across my back.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: I am Wind In His Hair. Do you not
see that I am not afraid of you?… Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>courier</strong>: The party that went against the Pawnee is
coming in…</p>
<p><strong>courier</strong>: There are many hearts on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I realize now that I have been wrong. All
this time I have been waiting. Waiting for what? For someone to find me?
For Indians to take my horse? To see a buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Since I arrived at this post I have been
walking on eggs. It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it. Tomorrow
morning I will ride out to the Indians. I do not know the outcome or the
wisdom of this thinking. But I have become a target and a target makes a
poor impression. I am through waiting.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Wait… you’re hurt.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You’re hurt… you need help.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Don’t…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: She’s hurt.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: You are not welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Go away from us…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Go away from us… go now.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: The soldier did not come to fight – he
is going away and we will let him.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: I am in agreement with Kicking Bird. We
will go down and talk to the white man and find out what kind of white
man he is.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: If this council decides to talk
with the man at the soldier fort then it will be so. But in my mind it
is not right that a Sioux chief, a chief as great as Ten Bears, goes to
ask the business of a puny, trespassing white man… a white soldier who
has only a smart horse and a few white man clothes.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: I will not go… you will go… you and
Kicking Bird. That is all I have to say.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Welcome… Come… please… sit down.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Would you like some coffee? Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’ll get some cups.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Is the coffee not good? Too strong maybe?
Here…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Do you want some?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: So what are you guys doing? Looking for
buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He’s a good one… good horse. My horse.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Good horse.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: My horse. You see any buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Wait just a bit.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: His mind is gone.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: The sugar didn’t figure to last at that rate
any way. I don’t believe I’d go too far in saying that a foundation for
good relations is being laid.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: They have come again, as always the same two
with an escort of six.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Have you seen any buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I believe I am dealing with Kiowa Indians as
I have heard that word on several occasions.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I am learning the Kiowa words for head,
hand, horse, fire, coffee, buffalo, hello and goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: No, I haven’t seen any buffalo. Are you
hungry? I have food… are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>escort 1</strong>: He waved.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Nothing I have been told about these people
is correct. They are not beggars and thieves. They are not the bogeymen
they have been made out to be.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Stands With A Fist.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: We will talk awhile.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Your wounds are healing well?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: You are happy here, with my
family?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I am glad to be here. I am
missing my husband.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Perhaps you will marry again when the
time is right.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: We have word from many places that the
whites are…</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: They are coming into everyone’s
country. They will soon be in ours I think. This white man who lives at
the old soldier fort, the one who calls himself loo ten tant… I have
visited him and I believe his heart is a good one. He knows things about
the whites which we do not.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I am afraid of the man at the
fort.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: He is only one man.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I am afraid that he will tell
some whites that I am here. I am afraid that they will try to take me
away.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Every warrior in camp would fight them
if they tried.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I cannot make the white man talk. Loo
ten tant does not know Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: You have a certain medicine which no
other Sioux – man or woman – has.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: It has been a long time since I
made the talk.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I do not ask this for myself… I ask
this for all our people.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: It’s dead in me.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I want you to try and remember the the
word.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: Will she make the white words?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Perhaps I am asking too much.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Christine…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Christine… where are you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m right here mother…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Get inside both of you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Just do what I… oh God! Stay where you are.
Keep down do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Who is it Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They look like Pawnee… my father and your
father are talking to them.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Run Christine…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Just run!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the
lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to
take.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Buffalo…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Buffalo… Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes. Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: The buffalo have come.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: Loo ten tant…</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Loo ten tant…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Help…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Help me… Please… I need to get out.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I wish I knew what to say.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Say… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: His speed… his power… you
have.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Look I’m full… I can’t tell the story
again.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You want to try… put it on.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: This is too much… I can’t take this…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I can’t… No more…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: One more… eat…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I can’t, I’m full… very full…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: That’s my hat.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: My hat.</p>
<p><strong>big warrior</strong>: I found it on the prairie. It’s
mine.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: That hat belongs to my friend
here.</p>
<p><strong>big warrior</strong>: He left it on the prairie. He didn’t
want it.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: You can see that he wants it
now.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: We all know that is a soldier hat.
We all know who wears it. If you want to keep it that’s alright. But
give something for it.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Good trade.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes, it’s good. But, I have to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Where is loo ten tant?</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: I ate him.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: I traded for it.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Does it scratch the skin?</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: A little. But do you see how good
it looks. Everyone says it looks good. Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: They asked me to dance…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I was just dancing…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: To stay any longer would’ve been useless. We
had all the meat we could possibly carry. We had hunted for three days,
losing half a dozen ponies and only three men injured. Many times I have
felt alone but until this afternoon, I have never felt completely
lonely.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Made a long patrol today. There is nothing
to report. The truth is I am bored.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Though only two days it seems like a week. I
am missing the company of my new friends. I can see all of their faces,
but somehow it is not enough. Tomorrow, I will make an unannounced
visit. After all, they are my neighbors, what can it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Damn him.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: C’mon Two Socks… you can’t go… so go
home.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Alright then, don’t go home. But stay… stay
right here.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You go home.</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: You were right about loo ten tant – he
is a special white man.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Yes, he is special… he should have a
real name.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Not everyone thinks it is a good
idea that he is here.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Kicking Bird has business with the
white man. Let him do it.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: We were waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Welcome. It is good that you are
here.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Hullo. You here… good.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Thank you… I feel good.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He thanks you. It is good.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Ask him why he is at the soldier
fort.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Uhh… you… come…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Wait… what is your name?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Our… names?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: What does he say?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He wants to know how we are
called.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Ahhh… He’s right. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He… he… Kick…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Kick?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Kicking?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Kicking… yes… Kicking… Bird.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Kicking Bird… What does he… is he a
chief?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Hul… hal… ho-lee… holy… holy
man.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Your name… you.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Up? Get up?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Stand.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Yes… Stands.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: More… Wiff… With.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Stands With A…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Fist?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Stands With A Fist. I’m John… John
Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: John Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I try to answer all of Kicking Bird’s
questions but I know he is frustrated with me. He always wants to know
how many more white people are coming. I tell him that it is impossible
for me to say. When he persists I tell him that the white people will
most likely pass through this country and nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: But I am speaking to him in half- truths.
One day there will be too many, but I cannot bring myself to tell him
that. I am sure that Stands With A Fist knows.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: A war party is going against the Pawnee soon
and I have asked to go. I sensed that I have made a mistake in doing so
but I could not bring myself to take it back. They are my friends and
from what little I gather the Pawnee have been very hard on these
people. I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’m glad to see you… please sit.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Kicking Bird wants to know why
you want to make war on the Pawnee. They have done nothing to you.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: They are Sioux enemies.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Only Sioux warriors will go.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I asked that he would think about my
going.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He has.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Then tell him this. I have been a warrior
for longer than many of the young men that will go on this war party.
Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He says that the Sioux way of
being a warrior is not the white way. You are not ready.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I know, I understand. But I cannot learn
these ways in camp.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He asks that you watch over his
family while he is gone.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: This thing he asks you… it is a
great honor for you.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I will be happy to watch over your
family.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He thanks Dances With Wolves for
coming.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Who is Dances With Wolves?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: It is the name which everyone is
calling you now.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Dances With Wolves… that’s right. How do you
say it?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Dances With Wolves.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Dances With Wolves.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Keep on with the white man talk if it
pleases you.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I like to make the white man
talk.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Dances With Wolves?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Grass grows on the prairie.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Fire lives on the prairie.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: That man is a fighter.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: That man is a fighter.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Alright… I have it… That
man…</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Is…</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: A… bone!</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: A bone… right?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: What is the word for
beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: It is hot. We are sitting in the
shade.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: …a bone.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: How is Dances With Wolves?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: How is he learning?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: He learns well… he is fast.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: You go for water?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Let us take you.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: How did you get your name?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I was not very old when I came
to be with the people… I was made to work.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I worked every day… very hard…
there was a woman who didn’t like me. She called me bad names… sometimes
she beat me. One day she was calling me these bad names, her face in my
face, and I hit her. I was not very big, but she fell down. She fell
hard and didn’t move. I stood over her with my fist and asked if any
other woman wanted to call me bad names… No one bothered me after that
day.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I would not think so.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Show me where you hit her.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Why are you not married?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I must go.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I’m sorry. Let me help…</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: You are not talking today?</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: Some of your words are wrong… but you
are learning fast. That is good. What can I tell you today?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I want to know about Stands With
A Fist.</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: What is your question?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: There is no man with her.</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: She is in mourning.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I do not understand
“mourning”.</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: She is crying for someone.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Crying for who?</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: It is not polite to speak of the dead…
But I will tell you… you are new. She cries for her husband. He was
killed not long ago.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: How long will she cry?</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: It is Kicking Bird’s place to say when
she is finished.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: People are talking about you…</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: They are proud of the medicine you are
making with Dances With Wolves.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I have hurt him and I must go
talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: You can’t, he is gone.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I am in mourning.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I know… Stone Calf told me.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: No one can know… we must be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: We must be careful.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: We got a snake.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: We’re gonna see if it can swim the river. You
wanna come?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Trouble…</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Pawnee… a big party… thirty or
forty men. The Kiowa hunters found them not far to the north. The Pawnee
are coming his way. Soon they will find our camp.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Stone Calf… I follow you.</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: The Pawnee do not come for horses, they
come for blood… and with many men gone, we are few.</p>
<p><strong>stone calf</strong>: Get your weapons and come to my
lodge.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: I will go.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Stone Calf… wait…</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I have guns… many far-shooting
guns.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: No, the ride is long… the weather is bad.
We can spare no men.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Guns would make one warrior like
two.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Take one man and go quickly.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I will take Smiles A Lot.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: Dances With Wolves… Dances With
Wolves.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Hear us now. A white soldier with many
far-shooting guns… how would he fight the Pawnee?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I would hide in the village.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Dances With Wolves has not finished.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I would let the enemy think we
are asleep… let him come close. Then we would shoot together and run to
fight them, drive them into the river and kill so many that they would
never trouble us again.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: I am of the same mind as Dances With
Wolves… we should kill so many that they never trouble us again.</p>
<p><strong>sioux 1</strong>: I killed this one.</p>
<p><strong>sioux 2</strong>: This one still breathes.</p>
<p><strong>sioux 3</strong>: Dances With Wolves…</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: It was hard to know how to feel.
I had never been in a battle like this one. This had not been a fight
for territory or riches or to make men free. This battle had no ego. It
had been fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through
winter, to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a
few feet away. I felt a pride I had never felt before.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I shot this one.</p>
<p><strong>1st warrior</strong>: Yes, I saw you shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>2nd warrior</strong>: You killed that one too.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I had never really known who
John Dunbar was. Perhaps because the name itself had no meaning. But as
I heard my Sioux name being called over and over, I knew for the first
time who I really was.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: There is gambling tonight… at
Horse Back’s lodge. Horse Back’s games are always good.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I am tired… and Horse Back
already has a good rifle of mine. thank you… goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: How long will Stands With A Fist
mourn?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: I hope it will not be too long.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Something has happened? Well what?</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: She has found love again.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: Dances With Wolves.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Are you certain of this?</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: When you see them together you will
know.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: What are people saying? They’re not
angry?</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: No. They like the match. It makes
sense. They are both white.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I suppose I will be the one to say
something.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: She’s your daughter now.</p>
<p><strong>black shawl</strong>: You can’t see everything coming.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Stands With A Fist.</p>
<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: You are no longer a widow.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: There’s talk that you want to get
married.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: To Stands With A Fist.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: That’s the one isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: She’s in mourning.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: She has been released. Kicking
Bird did it.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Kicking Bird told me to
wait.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: You might be waiting a long time.
Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking Bird riding on the prairie…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: He says he was talking to himself.
When a medicine man is the last to know he can take it pretty hard.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: You are pretty poor my friend and
a Sioux girl is not for free. I don’t know if you can get married.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I have the buckskin…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: That’s too much medicine.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Do you think the buckskin is too
much medicine?</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: For a girl.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Maybe we can help you… wait here
for us.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I thought we had been discreet
but apparently we fooled no one.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Wind In His Hair said if the
match was acccepted the ponies would be gone in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Turn around…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Pretty good…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: You know, the man she mourned for
was my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: He was a good man. It’s been hard
for me. I am not the thinker Kicking Bird is. But I think he went away
from her because you were coming. That is how I see it now.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: This is a good day for me.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: And for me.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Stands With A Fist… if you want this
man, take his hand in yours.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I had never been married before.
I don’t know if all grooms have the same experience. But as Kicking Bird
began to speak about what was expected of a Sioux husband, my mind began
to swim in a way that shut out everything but her. The tiny details of
her costume. The contours of her shape. The light in her eyes. The
smallness of her feet. I knew that the love between us would be
served.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Have you heard all that I have
said?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Good, then take her inside… she is
your wife.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Oh… good… thank you…
goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Dances With Wolves’ door is closed alot these
days.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: They’re trying to make a baby.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: You would think they could have made a
baby by now.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Maybe they’re having a hard time. Some people
have a hard time.</p>
<p><strong>smiles a lot</strong>: I don’t think they’re having a hard
time.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>otter</strong>: Maybe we should pull the smoke flap closed.
Then they would come out.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Dances With Wolves, are you in
there?</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I am riding today to a far away place.
It is a place I haven’t seen for a long time. A sacred place. I would
like you to come with me.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: It’s good to be out.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Yes it must be.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: We are trying for a baby.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: No waiting?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: No waiting.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: I was just thinking that of all the
trails in this life, there is one that matters more than all the others.
It is the trail of a true human being. I think you are on this trail and
it is good to see.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: It is said that all the animals were
born here… that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the
people. Even our enemies say this is a sacred place.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: It’s quiet.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: We must wait for these
people…</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: No, they’ve been gone a week maybe
more… we will water the horses and go home.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: You have asked me many times
about the white people… you always ask how many more are coming.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: There will be a lot my friend…
more than can be counted.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: Help me to know how many.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Like the stars.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: It makes me afraid for all the
Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: It’s hard to know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: The men who wore this came in the time of
my grandfather’s grandfather. Eventually, we drove them out. Then the
Mexicans came. In my own time the whites came… the Texans. They have
been like all the others who find something they want in our country.
They take it without asking. I have always been a peaceful man, happy to
be in my own country and wanting nothing from the white people. Nothing
at all. But I think you are right. I think they will keep coming. When I
think of that, I look at this bundle. Our country is all that we want.
We will fight to keep it.</p>

you guide us to these camps and serve as an interpreter, your conduct
will be reevaluated.</p>

<p><strong>stands with a fist</strong>: We have decided. You are my
husband. I am your wife. That is all I know.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Dances With Wolves is quiet these
days.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Is his heart bad?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Killing the soldiers at the
river was a good thing. It made me free and my heart was big to see my
friends coming to help me. I did not mind killing those men. I was glad
to do it.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: But the soldiers hate me now
like they hate no other. I am more than an enemy to them, I am a
traitor. They will hunt for me. They will not give up. And when they
find me they find you and that cannot happen.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Quiet!… sit down Wind In His Hair. You
are hurting an old man’s ears with your loud talk.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Dances With Wolves?</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Ahh… this is a nice fire… at my age a
good fire is better than anything.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: I wondered how your bad heart was doing
and though I would come by and see for myself. This place doesn’t look
so bad-hearted.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: No, we are happy.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: But you are leaving anyway?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I have talked with Stands With a
Fist and we will go together.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Have you told this to Kicking Bird or to
Wind In His Hair.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: You are the only white man I have ever
known. I have thought about you alot. More than you know.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: That does not surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: You have always spoken with your heart.
And like all of us, you are a free man and can do anything you like.
When I look across this fire, I do not see a white soldier. I see only a
Sioux named Dances With Wolves. And there is nothing they hate so much
as a Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: You are making a pipe?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: This might be a pretty good pipe… how
does it smoke?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I don’t know, I haven’t tried it
yet.</p>
<p><strong>ten bears</strong>: Let’s smoke it awhile… it is good to pass
the time this way.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: You’ve finished your pipe? How does it
smoke?</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: I’m told it smokes well.</p>
<p><strong>kicking bird</strong>: It doesn’t seem possible that we could
come this far.</p>
<p><strong>dances with wolves</strong>: You were the first man I ever
wanted to be like. I will not forget you.</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Dances With Wolves…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: I am Wind In His Hair…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Can you not see that I am your
friend?</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Can you not see that you will
always be my friend?</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Dances With Wolves…</p>
<p><strong>wind in his hair</strong>: Dances With Wolves…</p>
