<h1 id="grand-hotel">grand-hotel</h1>
<p><strong>dissolve into</strong>: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one –
and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business
jumble.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya will not want her
car.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Cancel Madam Grusinskaya’s car.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’hotel</strong>: Where is that gentleman’s soup?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Where’s that soup?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Quick – come on – come on…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Cold.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Preysing…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Telephone – from Fredersdorf –</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf – his
call.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes, Mr. Preysing –</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They’ve gone – Just a moment, sir…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You told me it was on – you said the call
was through.</p>
<p><strong>second girl</strong>: Who’s in number three?</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Senf – the hall porter.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Yes, it’s Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel…
Are you at the Clinic?,… How’s my wife?,… Is she in pain?,… Isn’t the
child coming soon?,… Patience! It’s easy for you to talk… Get away?,…
No, I can’t – I’d lose my job. It’s like being in jail. Oh, I hope the
child comes along all right.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Hello! Long Distance?,… Get off the wire…
No… I was talking to Fredersdorf… What?,… Oh… Hello!… Is that you dear?…
How is everything at home?… What do you hear from the factory?… No… How
are the children?… I left my shaving set at home… Yes, is your father
there?… Hello, father?… Our stock has gone down twenty-three points. If
our merger with the Saxonia doesn’t go through – I don’t know what we
can do… Hello, hello… yes, papa. Rely on me – everything depends on
Manchester… If they refuse to come in – well, we will be in bad shape…
no… Rely on me, I’ll make it go through – I’ll make it go through…
Waiting?… Yes, I’m still speaking…</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Hello, Mr. Meierheim?… Is that,
Mr. Meierheim?… This is Suzette… Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya’s maid… No…
Madam Grusinskaya will not go to the rehearsal… No… Madam is in a
terrible state, she didn’t sleep all night – She’s very tired… No, I’m
speaking from a booth – I didn’t want to speak in front of her… I gave
her a tablet of veronal… She’s sleeping now… You had better come to the
hotel, I’m afraid…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Baron Gaigern speaking. Yes, Baron Gaigern
himself. Where are you?,… Good… No – first, I need money. I need it
right now. I have to make a showing… That’s my business. I hope to do it
tonight… at the theatre or after the show… But money – for the hotel
bill, for tips… I don’t need advice, I need money!… Now, listen…</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Who is that, This is… Hello, hello!… Who
is that… Heinrich? This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich. This is Otto
Kringelein. Hello! Can you hear me?… I’ve got to speak very quickly.
Every minute costs two marks ninety… What?… Otto Kringelein! Yes, I’m in
Berlin, staying at the best hotel, the Grand Hotel… No, don’t you
understand? I want to explain, but I must do so quickly, it costs so
much. Please don’t interrupt me – hello? Hello! Listen! You know that
will I made before my operation? I gave it to you. I want you to tear it
up. Destroy it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin to see a great
specialist about that old trouble of mine… It’s pretty bad, Heinrich.
The specialist says I can’t live much longer. I haven’t long to live!
That’s what’s the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on the line? No, it
isn’t nice to be told a thing like that. All sorts of things run through
your head. I am going to stay here in Berlin. I am never coming back to
Fredersdorf. Never! I want to get something out of life, too. You
plague, and bother, and save – and all of a sudden you are dead.
Heinrich… You don’t say anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, do you
understand, the most expensive hotel in Berlin? I’m going to get a room
here. The very best people stay here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I saw
him – not five minutes after I was here. Sometime, I’d like to tell him
exactly what I think of him. Listen, Heinrich – I have taken all my
savings; my life insurance, too; I cashed in all my policies, the sick
benefit fund, the old age pension, the unemployment insurance, the
burial fund and everything… What’s that, miss?… Hello, Heinrich. I have
to hang up now. I have to pay three times overcharge. Just think,
Heinrich! There’s music here all day long. And in the evening, they go
around in full dress… Yes, sometimes I have pain, but I can stand it.
Everything is frightfully expensive here. You can imagine, the Grand
Hotel… What? Time’s up…</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I’m a sick man – Heinrich – Hello -
hello – Operator – every minute two marks ninety.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Dangerous?… That’s my business… I’ll do it
tonight – …I’ll do it alone.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam is afraid – she will never dance
again – there was no applause last night –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes – the merger – Manchester – it is my
business as much as yours – we’ve already lost eighty-five thousand
–</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: I’m on duty – I can’t leave the Grand Hotel –
it’s like being in prison – the baby –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Any calls?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Grand Hotel – people – coming – going… Who
cares… nothing ever happens.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Good little girl – nice ones?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Is that for me?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No – Madam Grusinskaya’s car is to be
brought.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car is to be brought.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy’s voice</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car… to be
brought.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Good evening, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Good evening. Will you send these up to Madam
Grusinskaya?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Yes, Baron. Madam Grusinskaya.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Room one-seventy – Madam Grusinskaya.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Have you my tickets for the theatre?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Oh yes, Baron – Baron von Gaigern’s seats for
Madam Grusinskaya.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No – Madam Grusinskaya’s car is not to be
brought.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car is not to be
brought.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Charge them…</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Good evening – my key – one sixty-
eight.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Oh – good evening, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: How’s the beautiful lady?</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Grusinskaya – well, to tell the truth,
Baron – tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre
last night?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Certainly – always when Grusinskaya
dances.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Well – last night was not so good.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I thought she was splendid!</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Yes – but the audience.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The parquot loges are behind the parquet
chairs.</p>
<p><strong>japanese</strong>: Then they’ve put me back and I want to be
up in front. How is that, chairs in front of loges?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: The train leaves at seven-thirty, Madam. That
is the only through train – the dining car goes along.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: It’s always so quiet here.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: If you occupied the room next to Madam
Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with
you.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know,
I’m quite indispensable to her. I’m her ballet master and her nurse. I
hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it’s Grusinskaya –
you can’t help adoring her.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Pardon me. Is Mr. Preysing in – I am
Doctor Zinnowitz.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Mr. Preysing – from Fredersdorf –</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Mr. Preysing –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Have I kept you waiting?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Waiting – I’m waiting for news from
Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: No news yet?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: No. No word.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Everything depends on the Manchester
merger.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I know – I know.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch – and as your
lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter —</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: I’m expecting a young woman – a
stenographer – she will ask for Mr. Preysing. Ask her to wait.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No – letters to two-eighty.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: If a young woman, a stenographer, – etc.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Any letters?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: No, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Telegrams?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: No, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Anyone asked for me?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Nobody, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: The war.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: letter – glances</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes – He always seems to be waiting for
something – and nothing ever comes.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: The war dropped him here and forgot
him.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes, I was in the war.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein’s voice</strong>: Please – please pay some
attention to me – I have no time.</p>
<p><strong>rohna</strong>: and gentleman, who</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I won’t wait – I can’t wait – I waited
three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.</p>
<p><strong>rohna</strong>: It’s a very nice room and inexpensive,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live
in – when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?</p>
<p><strong>rohna</strong>: Just one moment, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: No, I won’t wait – I can’t – Every day
is precious – every hour – Every minute.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I came here because I wanted to live
here, two weeks, maybe three – God only knows – I’ve told you I’ll pay –
I’ll pay anything you ask. I’m tired – I’m ill – I can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: Has the gentleman a
complaint?</p>
<p><strong>rohna</strong>: The gentleman is dissatisfied with room
number five fifty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I certainly have a complaint – and a
fair one.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I came here from a long distance to stay
at the Grand Hotel. I want a room – a big room – like you would give
General Director Preysing – I’m as good as Mr. Preysing – I can pay like
Mr. Preysing – would you give him a little room, way up in the corner
with the hot water pipes going – bang – bang – bang…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: This gentleman can have my room.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Send his bags up to my room.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – but – I –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’re tired. I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes – yes – I am tired. I have been
ill…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You are ill.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Mr. Kringelein will take room number
one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the
front with bath.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Does that mean that the bath is my own?
— Private?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Certainly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Well, now, that’s very kind – thanks.
That’s what I want – a large room on the front with a private bath –
Yes, that’s what I want. I can pay now if you like.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That will not be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Not at all, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Permit me – my name is Kringelein – from
Fredersdorf.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m Baron von Gaigern.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, a Baron!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: And this is Doctor Otternschlag.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – Doctor – you are a Doctor – I am
–</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I know – I know – when a man’s collar is an
inch too big for him – I know he is ill.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes – Oh – oh – yes, –</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Well, Baron – I must go and dress.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Is this gentleman a Baron, too?</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Unfortunately no.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Have you a minute now?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No – I told you not to come in this
lobby.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Time’s getting short.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’ve told you a hundred times not to speak to
me with a cigarette in your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: I want to speak –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Mr. Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Will you wait please.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The stenographer is to go up – Mr. Preysing
telephoned.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Mr. Preysing – one sixty-four.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Thanks – Heigh! – Wait!</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Poor Grusinskaya – how can she receive
anyone. She can’t – theatre, trains, hotels – hotels, trains
theatre.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: I must go and dress – she’ll be waking up
and calling for me.</p>
<p><strong>preysing’s voice</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What…! –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I’m the stenographer.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Then you will please wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Don’t hurry – take your time.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Like dancing?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Not with strangers.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Never?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You’re a fool!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes, I am rather.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: He must be very nice.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Whoever is keeping you waiting.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Have you seen it?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh, my large and noisy neighbor – really?
That?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: That.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh – work!!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Dictation. You know…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh… poor child. If you were free, I’d ask you
to come and have some tea – but –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Tea would spoil my dinner. One meal a
day, I’d hate to spoil it.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Reducing?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: No – why? – should I?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Lord no – charming – but why one meal a
day?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Money – Ever heard of it?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes – yes indeed – but you are a… …a
stenographer. Don’t little stenographers earn little pennies?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Very little.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Did you ever see a stenographer with a
decent frock on? – One that she’d bought herself?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Poor child – I wish I were free tonight – we
could –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Free –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Unfortunately no – to bad – tomorrow
though.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Shall we say five o’clock – downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Where downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yellow Room where they dance –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You’re very funny –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes? – Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: We’ll dance.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: All right. We’ll dance.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein’s voice</strong>: Baron – Oh, Baron!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: If I could trouble the Baron to come and
see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness
could join us.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! We are
having caviar – it’s expensive but that makes no difference – I see the
Baroness is laughing.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Have caviar if you like, but it tastes
like herring to me.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Asleep? – Ssshhh – sorry!</p>
<p><strong>suzette’s voice</strong>: Madam has slept well.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: No, I have been awake – thinking –
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>suzette’s voice</strong>: It is time for the performance.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The performance?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: It is time.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Always the performance – every day the
performance – time for the performance. I think, Suzette, I have never
been so tired in my life. Veronal didn’t even help me to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car is to be
brought.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I can’t dance tonight –</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: It will pass – it will pass – come.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Let us cancel the engagement.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: But, Madam. cannot do that.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Now is the time to cancel to stop
entirely. I feel it – everything tells me – enough – enough.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The peals are cold – everything is cold
– finished – it seems so far away – so threadbare – the Russians –
St. Petersburg – the Imperial Court – the Grand Duke Sergei – – Sergei –
dead – Grusinskaya – it’s all gone.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Mon Dieu – the pearls – if they were to
break –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The pearls won’t break – they hold
together and bring me bad luck —- I hate them!</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Orchids come again, Madam – no card – I
think perhaps they are from the same young man – he is at the end of the
corridor – tall – he walks like a soldier – Madam must have noticed how
often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Oh, Suzette – Suzette – Sshh –
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Ah, oui – the car is here for Madam.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Send it away – I shan’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya will not require her
car – no – she will not be going to the theatre.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: It is time for the performance.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The performance – the performance – the
performance.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: touches her shoulder</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: It is not stage fright – it’s something
more –</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: What – what is it? Last night…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Last night?… There was no applause.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: There was – there was.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: That theatre – half empty – dancing for
those few – I was frantic – I finished – the last beat and… …I waited –
I listened – but the applause didn’t come – nothing. A man in the box –
and just the claques behind – it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead – it’s
finished.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Meierheim –</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: What is this that you have cancelled your
car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a
whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do
you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?… Have we a
contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind? …Or is that the time?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I’m cancelling the engagement.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement.
Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha – hurry,
come on. Tonight – there’s a line in front of the theatre since six
o’clock. The house is jammed to the roof.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The house is not full – Is it really
full?</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Packed to the ceiling. Hurry – get
dressed. And what an audience – the French Ambassador – American
Millionaires – Princess Ratzville – er – er –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Oh – but it can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Oh, come, Madam – please come.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: All right, Suzette – quickly –
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: We will wait.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: You are late. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Tell Madam Grusinskaya’s chauffeur to
bring the car.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: How is the house?</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Terrible. After this, no more ballets for
me. Jazz – Just jazz.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: If the house is empty again, I don’t know
–</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: When she gets her paint on and hears the
music – she’ll be all right. I know these people.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may
mean nothing to you, but to me – they mean a great deal. You see, I’m
ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don’t want to
miss life – do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You are funny. You speak of life as if
it were a train you wanted to catch.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes – and for me, it’s going to leave at
any minute. Let’s drink.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I’m sure this beautiful room must appeal
to your taste – distinctive, don’t you think? Velvet upholstery –
‘A-number one’. I’m in the textile trade and I know. And these are real
silk drapes.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Silk – think of that – silk – they are,
too.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Have you seen the bathroom? – Hot and
cold running water – You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: The stenographer!</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Her master’s voice! I must go now –
goodbye – thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I’m engaged for the evening.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, can anyone engage you for the
evening?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: To take dictation – a Mr. Preysing –
Goodbye, you – tomorrow at five o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What’s the matter, Mr. Kringelein?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: General Director Preysing! Baron, when I
was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man’s factory
–</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Then you know him?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Do I know him – I know him through and
through.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I must – I hope to see you again,
Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: You will stay, Doctor – if you have
nothing better to do?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I have nothing better to do,
Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>no scenes</strong>: 24 and 25 Sequence omitted from original
script.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Perhaps you could present me now,
Mr. Pimenov.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Please, Baron – forgive me – not now – here
she is.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: My coat.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Suzette – I told you not to bring the
pearls. I will not wear them tonight.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Take them back, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: You haven’t time.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Hurry, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Such nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: The car for Madam Grusinskaya.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: No news from Manchester yet – Do you think
we ought to postpone the conference?</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Good heavens no. That’d create the very
worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You
know as well as I do that the merger must go through.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes – the merger must go through – But I
am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an
honest business man – a good husband and father – I have a sense of
honor – I have nothing to conceal. I couldn’t live happily
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Well, don’t get excited about it. We
agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I want to dictate my statement for
tomorrow. I can’t speak without notes. I like to have things down before
me in black and white.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: I’ll see you in the morning then, at the
conference. Everything’ll be all right, Preysing… Don’t worry.
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>preysing’s voice</strong>: Both parties have fully agreed
that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Moreover –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Moreover –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Moreover – Is there a telegram for me
yet?… Oh – when it does, send it up.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Now, where was I? Oh – sorry. Where was
I?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Moreover…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Moreover…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz’
office?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: No – only occasional jobs.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Tired?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You pay me.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You’re a very unusual stenographer –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Moreover…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Moreover…</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I don’t see why it’s unusual for a
stenographer to be pretty – if she does her work well, – seems so silly.
I don’t know why they don’t like girls like me in offices. Personally, I
hate offices – I’d much rather be in the movies.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Movies?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Yes, I photograph very well. Look –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I got ten marks for that.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Moreover…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Only in mutual advantages –
moreover.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What brown hands you have.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: That’s from skiing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Skiing?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Yes… A man I know took me to Switzerland
last month…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: A man? – To Switzerland? – That must have
been nice – for him.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Only in mutual advantages –
moreover…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Moreover… He was a lucky man – that
man.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Don’t misunderstand me. I’m a married man
– with grownup daughters. Uh –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Moreover – Do you mind if I smoke? I
went to Florence once, too.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: With the same friend?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Moreover, the possibility of the
successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester
Cotton Company…</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Not too quickly.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You’re a little too fast.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Can’t you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I understand you perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Have you got it now?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Cotton Company –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Should throw a great weight into the
balance…</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: looks at him</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Telegram for Mr. Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Oh – oh.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Deal with Manchester Cotton Company
definitely off.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: How nice – your daughters?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: My daughters – yes, my daughters.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Is that Mrs. Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Definitely off.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh – too bad. Did you quarrel?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: That’ll be all – be here tomorrow at nine
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>baron’s voice</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: You are late – the dancer’s gone to the
theatre.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: She’s gone to the theatre – don’t you
know?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: And what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: The pearls are in her room.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Now listen to me. The others are getting
suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think
you’re scared.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’ve been careful, I’ve been waiting my
chance.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: You’ve been waiting your chance. You’re
too much of a gentleman – that’s the trouble with you.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I told you I’ll get the pearls tonight.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Need any help?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Have you got that skeleton key?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: The floor clerk is out there in the corridor
– she sees everything —</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: I could take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind
– while you…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No – no – no – no…</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Poor girl – chloroform would give her a
rotten headache… I know – I had it in the war. Besides, she’s very
pretty – not young but –</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: You’re no good for this business. It’s
just a joke to you…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I don’t like your tone.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Get out and leave it to me… be ready to leave
on the night train for Amsterdam…</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: With the pearls?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: With the pearls –</p>
<p><strong>loud speaker</strong>: ‘You are listening to the music of the
Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.’</p>
<p><strong>chambermaid</strong>: No – no – there is no one here.</p>
<p><strong>inspectress</strong>: You’re late… What have you been
doing?</p>
<p><strong>chambermaid</strong>: Everyone – all the time says, ‘Come
back - come back.’ They won’t get out of their rooms.</p>
<p><strong>inspectress</strong>: No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here… The
Western Theater?… No…</p>
<p><strong>suzette’s voice</strong>: Have you seen Madame?</p>
<p><strong>clerk’s voice</strong>: Isn’t she at the theatre?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes…
Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?… No, she is not here… Yes, I’m at the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Pimenov?… What’s happening?… No, I
haven’t found her. Is Desprez dancing?… How is it?… Oh, all right. Keep
the show going. Wait till I see her, she’ll pay for this – this little
trick is going to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach of contract.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madame is ill – her nerves…</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Her nerves… What about my nerves?… Who is
she anyway? Where does she think she is – Russia? Those days have
passed.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madame –</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Should I – Does madame wish…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Suzette, please go, I want to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: I suppose I can cancel the Vienna
engagement.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I wish to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: You’ll be very much alone, my dear
madame. This is the end.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The end – over – finished –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The Western Theatre –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Western Theatre?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The stage – Mr. Pimonov – the ballet
master… Grusinskaya – hurry – hurry.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes – yes, I’m waiting.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Hello, Pimenov? – I’m at the hotel. I
couldn’t go on – I couldn’t… No, no don’t – …Just alone… Good night,
good night, my dear – goodbye… Pimenov, how is it going, badly?… Uh?…
Who’s dancing?… Desprez?… Oh – and how is it?… Oh, – oh, I see – they
didn’t miss me?… They didn’t miss me. They didn’t miss me – good night,
Pimenov…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Oh – I’m sorry, yes… I have
finished.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Careful – there’s broken glass on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Please do not be frightened, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: What do you want here?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Nothing – only to be here.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Why do you hide in my room?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: But surely you must know – because I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Because you love me – you love me?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good
to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I was so alone – always alone – and
suddenly you were there and said that. No. I am not afraid. It is
strange.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Don’t cry – it tears my heart to see you sob
like that.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Nerves – just nerves. You must forgive
me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to
be tired – tired of a routine existence?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m afraid not – I usually do just what I
feel like doing at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: So you feel like coming into a lady’s
room – and you come… What now?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’d like to smoke a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Why do you look at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I did not know you were so beautiful… and
–</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: And then –?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No irony. You’re so appealing – so soft – so
tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more
happen to you – ever.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: And – and –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: How tired you are!</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes – tired…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: So alone.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange –
strange creature.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You mustn’t talk Russian to me.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Strange man…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Am I quite strange to you?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Not quite strange now. It is as if I
had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I
found a man hiding in my room – a young officer –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: He disappeared. Later he was found
dead.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a
woman’s room when she’s alone.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Go away. Who are you –?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: A man who could love – that is all, who has
forgotten everything else for you.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: You could love me. It is so long since
I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so
icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you – Let
me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I saw you just now – then I saw you cry – and
now I see you in the mirror – Grusinskaya…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Grusinskaya… Oh – oh if you knew how I
slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya – for the success of Grusinskaya – for
the triumph of Grusinskaya… and what is she now? Just someone who has
found that on the day success ceases life ceases – Are you listening to
me – Do you understand? – I want you to understand.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes – I do understand.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I think you must go now – the key is on
the floor.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m not going – You know I’m not going – Let
me stay here?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: That is not so – you don’t want to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I want to be alone –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No – You don’t want to be alone at all – You
were in despair before – If I left you, you’d feel worse than you did
before, You must not be alone – You mustn’t cry – you must forget… Tell
me that I can stay with you – tell me.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Just for a minute then.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What? Say it again – I didn’t hear.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: You – man…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Thank you – you are gallant. What a
sentimental scene. Grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. It is
many years since she did such a thing… You frightened me – badly. You’re
responsible for this – painful scene.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: The stage frays one’s nerves… the
discipline – it’s so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don’t
want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have
you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I? – Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure
in doing.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I see – you do only what you take
pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman’s bedroom
and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so
you do it… And what is your pleasure now?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I should like to smoke.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Why do you smile?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Because I can see something in the mirror
that you cannot. My dear –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: What can you see?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You are beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was
so dangerous to look into a woman’s bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I think you had better go now. The key
is on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m not going… You know that I’m not going…
Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that –?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: The veronal – you. I’m going to stay here
with you.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: That is not the truth. You do not want to be
alone – you’re afraid of being alone – I know you’re afraid. I know you.
You were desperate, just now, if I go away you’ll be more desperate than
ever. Say I am to stay with you… say it.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: For just a minute then. No – oh,
no!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Just for a minute, Grusinskaya –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, but Doctor. Isn’t this wonderful. To
live – to live – in the Grand Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The Grand Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, but Doctor. The music – the
champagne – girls when they dance – all the shining ice in those big
silver things – That’s life –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Life! – Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk – good
night.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: But Doctor –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Mr. Kringelein – you are drunk – good
night.</p>
<p><strong>baron’s voice</strong>: I’ve never been as happy.</p>
<p><strong>gru’s voice</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>baron’s voice</strong>: I’ve never been as happy!</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya’s voice</strong>: Say it again – say it!</p>
<p><strong>baron’s voice</strong>: I have never been so happy!</p>
<p><strong>girl one</strong>: Grand Hotel – good morning – no, Baron von
Gaigern’s room does not answer… Yes,… all right… Baron von Gaigern’s
chauffeur calling.</p>
<p><strong>girl three</strong>: Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor
Otternschlag… No, Doctor, no messages… No, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>girl five</strong>: Grand Hotel – good morning… who is
calling Madam Grusinskaya?… Oh, Mr. Pimenov. Madam Grusinskaya is not to
be disturbed, sir… no, sir… yes, sir –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Preysing’s calls to one sixty two for
today.</p>
<p><strong>girl eight</strong>: – good morning… Mr. Preysing –</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>schweimann</strong>: He likes to play the great man.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: The Preysing stock is holding its own today
on the market.</p>
<p><strong>schweimann</strong>: Ask Preysing what it’s costing him to
keep it up.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: And ask me what it’s costing us to
hammer it down.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: If the Preysing people get the
Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company
– but if they haven’t they’re ruined – Preysing will have to declare
himself.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: Shhh – here he is now.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen – Mr. Preysing
will be here in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Sorry I’m late, I’ve been waiting for
Justice Zinnowitz, my legal advisor.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: Oh – ho – you want legal aid against us? –
The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Very simple – I’ve always liked the way
you dressed, Preysing – English, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: They turn out marvelous material in
Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Manchester – yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes –
Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? – Have we cigars – water
and everything?</p>
<p><strong>schweimann</strong>: Manchester is a very interesting city,
don’t you think so, Preysing?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Manchester – yes – yes. A man in the
textile industry naturally has to know Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: There’s a lot of business to be done
with the Manchester Cotton Company. They’ve the whole English market
right in their hands. Have you any connections with – Manchester?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: We have a good many connections in
England, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: I mean with the Manchester people?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: We are here to discuss our merger.
Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Since, on the eleventh of June, this year
– when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms
was entered into – both parties have fully agreed that this merger can
result only in mutual advantages.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Oh – yes – I beg your pardon!</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I’m laying before you the last general
statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw
material and finished product – for instance – mop rags –</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Mop rags –!</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: What we want to know about is
Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: Yes, Mr. Preysing – that’s what we want to
know.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I’d like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz,
before I commit myself.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Oh – Preysing, Preysing –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: No water – What a place!</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: All you have to do is phone for it.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Water – seltzer, three or four bottles
and cigars – good ones.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: I can see this session is going to be
exhaustive.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Now to proceed with the projected merger,
the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious…</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Oh – now let’s talk like adults. You
want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know
all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn’t sound
so good. When you first approached us…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: We did not approach you.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: Letter on file September fourteenth would
show that you approached…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: from his hand –</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Tentative my foot – a month before this
your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Scratched – We did not take the
initiative.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Of course you took the initiative.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen – I see the
conference is already underway.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz – I’m
at cross-purposes with these gentlemen – will you clear up the
situation?</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: But the situation is perfectly clear, If
you will allow me –</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: How clear is Manchester?</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Foggy – frightfully foggy, always, I’m
told. Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I can make no statement about Manchester
at this time.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Well – gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Since, on the eleventh of June of this
year – when the first negotiations for a merger…</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: voice – with a sigh –</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: takes glasses from his nose – he is</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: We did not approach you.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I know you did – I said you did –</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: And I said we didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: And I know we didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Oh – I was ambitious then – ambition
was in my blood – no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little
soldiers – We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in
St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond – a duty
machine – No rest, no stopping. And then – I became famous and whoever
is famous is alone… But why should I be telling you this? Last night I
did not know you at all – who are you, really? – I do not even know your
name.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother
called me Flix.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Flix. – And how do you live? What kind
of a person are you?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m a prodigal son, the black sheep of a
white flock – I shall die on the gallows.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Really, I haven’t a bit of character. None at
all.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: When I was a little boy I was taught to ride
and be a gentleman – at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray
and lie – and —</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: And then, in the war, to kill and hide.
That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: And what do you do – now?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m a gambler – I’m running at large like a
happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong
in jail</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Oh! What a picture – and what else?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m also a criminal and a hotel thief.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: That’s a silly joke.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Please look at me. You must believe me – you
must believe that I love you – that I have never known what love is –
until last night.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: What is the matter?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Flix!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Did you come here just – just for that?
Oh – it’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: You may keep the pearls – I don’t want
them any more – I’ll make you a present of them.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I don’t want them now.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I’ll not denounce you.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: So –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yesterday I was a thief – but now, –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: But now, you must go… I give you the
pearls. But now you must go —</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I wanted money desperately – Can you
understand? – That’s why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened – I was
desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I’ve been following
you – I’ve admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you
– Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and – and
now.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: And now?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I couldn’t go through with it.
Remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes – yes – yes.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Quickly – here.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Good morning, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Good morning, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam has slept well?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Oh, yes, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam will dress now, it is late.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Five minutes, Suzette, come back in
five minutes. I’ll ring.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam is beautiful this morning.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: You must go now.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: There – it begins.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Hello – hello – Meierheim? Yes…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: What?… Cancel Vienna?… Are you mad? We
always have great success in Vienna… Certainly not. Come here and see
me… yes… good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: There – the day begins… I must go to
rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Grusinskaya –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You do believe that I really love you?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes – If I didn’t believe that, I’d die
after last night.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I want to be good to you – madly good.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Suzette will be back here in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’ll go – good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Shall I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Suzette will be back here any
minute.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: When are you leaving Berlin?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Very early in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: For Vienna?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Can’t – can’t you – Couldn’t you come
too – I think it would be better – for us – for us both.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh – yes but – later.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Why later?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I have no money now – I must get some first –
I must get some.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I’ll give you what you need – I have
money.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh no – that would spoil everything. I’ll – I
will manage somehow – I’ll manage myself. I will go with you. When does
the train leave?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Six twenty-seven in the morning… But
the money?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Never mind – I’ll get it. I have a whole day.
I’ll be on that train.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I shall dance and you’ll be with me and
then – listen – After that you will come with me to Lake Como, I have a
villa there. The sun will be shining. I will take a vacation – six weeks
– eight weeks. We’ll be happy and lazy. And then you will go with me to
South America – oh!</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: You must go now. Be careful on your way
to your room.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’ll go. – I love you. I’ll be on that train.
I’ll get the money.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Don’t do anything foolish – I’m alarmed
about you.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll be on the train. He
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes, Pimenov… Yes… where are you, in
your room? Come, I will see you now… hurry.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Not that dark dress – something light –
bright – it’s a sunny morning, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Good morning, Pimenov.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Good morning, Gru – your –</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Pimenov, I have an idea – a new ballet
– it must have mad music – I’ll explain it to you later. But now, hurry
to the theatre – I want full rehearsal – properties – full ballet and
some musicians. Hurry – Quickly. I will be there –</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Gru – you are positively radiant.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Yes, Pimenov. One minute, Suzette, I
will call you.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: her voice is like</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Will you get me Baron von Gaigern,
please… Cherie… yes… it is you… nothing… good morning, good morning,
cherie… nothing… no… just to tell you I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Step back please.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: I’ve told you three times – Baron von Gaigern
is out.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Did he leave any message for me?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: No, he did not – there is no message.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Any letters?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: No, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, Doctor, such a day – such a day!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: and handing them to</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya – at once –</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Your chauffeur’s been waiting, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles
an hour, at least…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes, quite.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: We’ve been together all day… and in an
aeroplane.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best
shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk – feels so nice on the skin… a
London hat, see – made in England, that’s silk, too – fifty marks… Look,
the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very
fine gentleman – no one in my life has been so nice to me as the
Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m going to change and we’ll meet for a
drink in the Yellow Room.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: In the Yellow Room, where the music’s
playing and the ladies are?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Where the music’s playing and the ladies
are…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No pain, Mr. Kringelein?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had
pain I’d be too happy to notice it…</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Find cut here.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: …and let me say again for the tenth time…
…you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves…
fully agreed on all the terms – Why should the signing of these articles
be suddenly held up?</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: I’ve admitted that at one time we had
reason for desiring ther merger – What reason have we now? The Preysing
Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Evil days – I’ve shown you here – – my
company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of
mop rags a year.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Mop rags – mop rags – we’re interested
in something quite different!</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>schweimann</strong>: Shall I tell them again?</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Why waste time – it’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>schweimann</strong>: You see – what we are interested in
–</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Ah, come on – we’re going home.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard
for certainties…</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: You’ve talked enough today, you’re
hoarse now.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Sorry, Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You’ve decided against the merger?</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Then, it’s all over?</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: Well – well – You could call my office.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull
through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We’ve…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Why talk – it’s over – it’s over – it’s
finished. You’ve broken off negotiations. You did it. You’re calling
them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, –
Manchester – Manchester. You don’t suppose for one moment that I’m such
a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about
Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Oh no – no – the session is over. Let’s
go, it’s off. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: If you actually have news from
Manchester then…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Gentlemen, I am now free to announce…
…that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has
been successfully negotiated.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Preysing, you’re joking with us.</p>
<p><strong>schweimann</strong>: You’re a deep one.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: In that case give us the articles.
We’ll sign at once. We know all the details…</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: up the telegram and puts it back in
his</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Under these circumstances it’s quite a
different matter.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Under these circumstances we might refuse
to sign.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Come on – business is business – Come
on –</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: Here’s my signature – here Preysing,
sign here.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: What a session this has been.</p>
<p><strong>schweimann</strong>: It’s twenty-five to six.</p>
<p><strong>waitz</strong>: We should celebrate this with a bottle of
wine.</p>
<p><strong>gerstenkorn</strong>: See you soon, Preysing. Next week we’ll
meet and discuss further details.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Next week.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Next week.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: You let me talk till I’m hoarse and you
had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Well – the deal has been put through.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes, it has been put through – it has been
put through.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Bluff – Bluff – all bluff.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: What’s bluff?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: That.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: ’Deal with Manchester definitely off!
“Preysing, oh – I’d never have thought it of you.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: No one would have thought it of me. I’ve
been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world
wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on…</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: You must go to Manchester at once
yourself and really see it through.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes – I must go to England – I was
desperate – Now I don’t care – This sort of thing goes to a man’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: What you need is some relaxation.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes – that’s what I want – I’d like to
tear loose – I’d like a drink. I’d like to go down to that dancing
place. I’d like to start something.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: I can understand that – after your – uh
–</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Say it – say it – my lie – it’s the first
time in thirty years that I’ve ever… Where’s that stenographer? Miss
Flaemm…</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: What do you want with her?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I want to see her, I want to do some
dictating – report of the conference for my father-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: She had an engagement in the Yellow Room
at five o’clock – she was in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Zinnowitz, would you say she was
pretty?</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Pretty as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Let’s go down and find her – I need a
drink – Come along Zinnowitz. I don’t know anything about women – been
married for twenty-six years.</p>
<p><strong>zinnowitz</strong>: Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it.
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Aeh!</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Hello… Father-in-law?… Is that you?… The
agreement is signed – I did it… yes, father-in-law… but now I must go to
Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Barman – whiskey – For you,
Mr. Kringelein?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: For me? – Oh, please, something sweet
and cold.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: A Louisiana flip, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: A Louisiana flip, that sounds very nice
– sweet, eh? –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What do you do in the Grand Hotel? Eat –
sleep – loaf around – do business – flirt a little – dance a little. A
hundred doors to one hall and nobody knows anything about the person
next to him. When you leave another takes your room and lies in your bed
– the end.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Kringelein – Where’s
the Baron?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I’m waiting for him here. The Baron and
I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour – in a motor car –
and in an aeroplane – It was marvelous –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Mr. Kringelein – How you have changed,
you look so nice.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please,
Miss Flaemm – Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won’t you have something sweet – a
Louisiana flip. A Louisiana flip.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: No - absinthe.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes – that –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You like music?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes – it’s stimulating – a man might
–</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: A man might what?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I don’t know – I’d like to do anything
–</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh – you would!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Hello – sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – here you are, Baron. A drink – A
Louisiana flip?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel
now?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: A little strange, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I’d given you up.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: A drink, Baron – A Louisiana flip?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No thanks – keeping my head clear.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Dance then?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: She’s beautiful – isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Oh – there are plenty of women.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: What have you been doing all day?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Chasing around.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Chasing what?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You were very different yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yesterday – yes – that was yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what
you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: What, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: A masculine paradise – drink, the ladies,
dancing…</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I had a very good opportunity, a young
lady asked me to dance – I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be
very important.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You must learn as quickly as your time
allows – Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn’t with a woman is a
dead man.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Haven’t you anyone – Haven’t you anybody
– you – I mean – Are you all alone in the world.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m always alone – I have been
everything.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Everything?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I was sent as a military surgeon to South
Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I
was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face.
Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.
I’ve been everything.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: That was lovely.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Will you do me a big favor?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I’ll do anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Would you like to make a man happy?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Yes – I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Then dance the next number with
Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I feel sorry for him.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You’re not a bit like you were
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I fell in love last night – the real
thing.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh – there’s no real thing – it doesn’t
exist.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I thought that, too – but I found that it
does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Miss Flaemm.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Presently, Mr. Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: It’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here
with me.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Insolent – Berlin manners.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I wish you a very good evening,
Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – you must know me – Kringelein at
the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three – third
floor.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Come and dance with me,
Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm –
business.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: No – now.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Do you gentlemen know each other,
Mr. Kringelein – Mr. Preysing – Baron von Gaigern.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and
not accept your invitation to dance.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I could not think of not accepting.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You say that you are employed by us in
Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which
ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means –
Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your
books.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Now, children, no fighting – save that
for the office. Let’s have our dance.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I’ll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh, let the poor devil alone.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I did not ask your advice.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I think it would be much better if you went
away.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: We shall see who remains here the
longer.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: As you will.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You must look at my face and not at the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You’re trembling.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I never danced before – in public.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You dance splendidly.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I’m happy, Miss Flaemm.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: For the first time in my life, I’m
happy.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Let’s stop – I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Thank you, Miss Flaemm.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You may go, Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Does the world belong to you,
Mr. Preysing?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What is this insolence?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Do you think you have free license to be
insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you’re superior, but
you’re quite an ordinary man.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Go away – go away.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Please – please!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: You don’t like to see me enjoying
myself.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Who are you? – An embezzler most
likely.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: An embezzler – you’re going to take that
back, right here in the presence of this young lady – who do you think
you’re talking to? You think I’m dirt, if I’m dirt, you’re a lot
dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You’re discharged.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes you – shut your mouth – get out –
you’re discharged.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: You can’t discharge me – I’m my own
master now – at last. I’m ill, I’m going to die – do you understand? I’m
going to die very soon. Nothing can happen to me now. Nobody can do
anything any more to me. By the time you can have discharged me I shall
have been dead already.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Come, Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: The man’s insane – he acts as if he is
glad he is going to die… I shall see you in the lobby in half an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>house detective</strong>: Better let him stay – I’ve sent for
the Baron… How’s your wife coming along?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: I was at the hospital all night walking up and
down the corridor. They wouldn’t let me in to see her. She has the
pains, but the child doesn’t come and I have to stay here chained to
this desk.</p>
<p><strong>house detective</strong>: It will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Did you send that page?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: The young lady’s there, sir.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Sit here. Cognac – for you?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I’m going to keep an eye on that
Kringelein fellow. I’ll find out where he gets the money to hang around
the Grand Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Well – you want me?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I must go to England – at once.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You see, I’d like to take a secretary with
me for my correspondence and – humm – humm – for company on the trip –
I’m nervous – I need somebody – I don’t know if you quite understand me.
You said you have travelled with gentlemen – and I mean –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I understand perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: What do you think your salary would be –
for such a trip?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Wait – I must figure it up. First, I’ll
need – clothes – shoes – it’s cold in England in March, I’ll need a
suit… You’d want me to look nice?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Of course – of course.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: A thousand marks –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: It’s agreed – I will get a room here for
you.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I can get a room here in the Grand Hotel
for you.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Can you pay some attention to me?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Insolent young cub!</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You mean Baron von Gaigern?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Baron!</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Well, he’s a gentleman!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: The Baron is tired?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No, Kringelein, not tired, – just – Well –
well –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go
to the Casino – the place we passed with the marvelous bright
lights?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’d like to Kringelein, but I can’t – I am
broke!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Broke – A Baron? But, Baron –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’ve quit.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m not going to get those pearls and neither
are you.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: What about the money?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’ll pay you back.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I have an idea working in my head…</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: You might find a bullet through that
head…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: If you did that, you’d get nothing except the
police after you. If you wait – I’ll give you your six thousand back
–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car – Madam Grusinskaya’s
car.</p>
<p><strong>inside porter</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car –</p>
<p><strong>megaphone</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Go on please – go on, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Bless you…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Are you coming to the theatre? Oh – I
shall dance tonight – How I shall dance – I want to feel that you are in
the theatre.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No! I can’t explain now. Oh, look – the
pearls. You wear them now…</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Why do you think –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: They’ve brought me such good luck – you
–</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I’m worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: On the train?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Yes – I will be on the train.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Till then.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Bless you –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Was the Baron joking, or is it really
true that the Baron is – in financial straits.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to
raise some money immediately.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: If the Baron – if you would permit me
–</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I would be awfully glad to oblige,
you’ve been so decent to me. Three hundred?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: If I could get into a game I might win
some.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Gambling! I’d like that. I have over six
thousand eight hundred marks with me.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: If we could scare up some men to play.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: We could come to my room.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Going?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Ready, Kringelein?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Ready, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron’s voice</strong>: All right, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: I play – I play – Here – Up – Playing –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein’s voice</strong>: Yes – me.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Is that too much, Baron?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: No – not at all.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Don’t show them.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: What do I do now?</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Turn ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh yes – that’s right – look! I win,
don’t I –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: There you are gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Will you take the bank, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes – I’ll take everything gentlemen –
please, let us drink – champagne — champagne is expensive and good. I’m
winning more than I used to earn in a year – double what I used to
earn.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Where is the Baron – where are you,
Baron?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’ll take the bank – All right,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: That was my last.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: You’ve lost everything?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’ve no luck.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Drink to me, Kringelein – it’s my last
chance.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I do drink, Baron – I drink to you,
Baron and to win. It’s good, – come along, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I take five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: All of that at once, Baron?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Eight.</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s voice</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: That’s it. The luck’s with you.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Come along, Mr. Kringelein. Sit here.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I’m having luck for the first time in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Out, Baron?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: For a while – I’ll recover – in ten or twenty
years. Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein’s voice</strong>: I’ve won again, Baron – I’ve won
again.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Baron, I drink and win – I drink and win
– I win and drink!</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: There are complaints in the hotel about the
noise.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: What time is it? Getting late? Let’s break
it up! You’ve been very lucky… Where’s my coat? Let’s go. He’s drunk
anyway!… Goodnight, Baron. Let’s wind up the game, I’m broke and tired;
you can’t play against him. I put my hat down here, somewhere. I think
I’ll have a drink before I go. By the way, I’ve got to see you tomorrow
morning. How’ve you been, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, don’t go, gentlemen! – Stay a while.
Be my guests!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I oughtn’t to presume, but I – I’m so
grateful to you – it’s been so marvelous. The first time in my life I
have gambled – I’ve danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it’s the
first time in my life I’ve ever tasted life!</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Splendid!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very
dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it’s wonderful. You
gentlemen don’t know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I –
believe me – a man must know death and not until then does a man know
anything about life.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp
burns.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: It’s a short life and a gay one…</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Every glass high to life – the splendid,
dangerous, mighty, brief – brief life – and the courage to live it.
Baron, you know – I’ve only lived since last night – but that little
while seems longer than all the time before – all the –</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Drunk.</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: Poor fellow.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Drunk? No, he’s ill. Looks ill. He’s a
doctor – The doctor’s here – He’s just drunk!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Gentlemen, this man is ill – very ill – if
you will leave.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight! Goodnight,
Baron! Bad luck!</p>
<p><strong>drunken man</strong>: He’s not used to champagne – why does
he drink it?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can I help, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No, the Baron will stay.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It will be over in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Over – over so soon – it has just begun.
Oh, the pain.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Try and sleep, Kringelein, don’t be
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I’d like to live a little longer but –
I’m not afraid to die – I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You’ll be all right, Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein’s voice</strong>: My pocketbook… my money in
it…</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s voice</strong>: What do you say – what?</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s voice</strong>: You what – Oh, isn’t it there?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein’s voice</strong>: No – But no I – Baron, I’ve lost
my pocketbook.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: There is no pocketbook here… On the floor
probably.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: More than fourteen thousand marks… were
in that pocketbook.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Fourteen thousand marks… One can travel –
one’s happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks – don’t you
think so, Baron?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Quite possibly.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, I’ve got to find it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: No – I must find it – Fourteen thousand
two hundred marks.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: I’m all right, Doctor. There’s no pain
now – only you don’t know what that money means to a man like me.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: as he crawls looking floor on his hands
and knees talking to the carpet as he like an animal along the wall –
looking</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He must find his money, Baron.
Mr. Kringelein should find his pocketbook, Baron, shouldn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Here – here it is. Here’s your pocketbook,
Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – yes – that’s it – you found it –
you found it for me, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Goodnight, Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: No – no please – oh, don’t go – don’t go
– don’t leave me alone, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’ve nothing to fear, Kringelein</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Come, get up – come let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein
up – If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You’re all right now – it’s very late –
goodnight, Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, no, stay here, Baron – stay.</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s voice</strong>: Goodnight, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the
middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Looking for my room – one sixty-
six.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You live here?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: For tonight.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Yes – oh!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Well – such is life, Flaemmchen.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: And Baron, thanks so much for
everything.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Flaemmchen!</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You are late. I’ve been waiting for you –
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I had to arrange about the trip.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You’re sweet.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Here, hold up!</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh – careful, Mr. Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Call me – do you know – would you – would
you like to call me by my first name?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: of an excuse for</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I couldn’t do that, you’re a stranger to
me.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: You’re a funny little creature,
Flaemmchen. I can’t make you out.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: It’s not funny at all. One can’t get
intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything
like that – supposing I met you next year and I said: ‘How do you do,
Mr. Preysing! And you said: ’That was the young lady who was my
secretary in Manchester’.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: That’s all quite proper. But supposing I
met you when you were with your wife and I called out: “Hello you big
baby – remember Manchester?’ And you with your wife, how would you like
that?</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Please, Flaemmchen – we’ll leave my wife
out of this.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: All right. I’ll get undressed – get
out.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Aha! – The Baron. What do you want
here?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I must have made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Made a mistake – remarkable. We shall soon
see if you made a mistake. Stay here… Give me that money.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: So that’s how we stand, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Look here, sir – I’m completely at your mercy
– I’m desperate – it’s a matter of life or death – I had to get some
money – tonight.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Indeed you must, Baron – you must. Humm –
humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you’re a thief.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I’m going to call the police. I’m going to
watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat!
Aristocrat!</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: The door is locked, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Hello! Hello! –</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Strike me, would you? Attack me would you?
Attack me –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I’ll strike you – I’ll strike you – I’ll
strike you – Strike me!</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I strike you –</p>
<p><strong>night girl</strong>: Yes – yes – Operator – Operator – They
are having a nice little game up there with the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Mr. Kringelein – Mr. Kringelein – where
are you?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Quick – Mr. Kringelein.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – what – what –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It’s you –</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Quick – something awful – awful has
happened. Go – go at once, – Mr. Preysing –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Preysing?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh, don’t wait – go – it’s awful – it’s
awful.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Don’t wait now – go – Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Mr. Preysing – Oh, Mr. Preysing –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh – the Baron – the Baron.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: He tried to rob me – he is dead –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: My best friend – poor, Baron – dead –
just like that.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: – We must do something…</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes, the police must be called.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: No – no – wait – the man was a burglar –
he was going to steal my money.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Oh, no – no – not the Baron.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: Where is that girl – she was working with
him – she enticed me into her room.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Her room – oh – I see, Mr. Preysing – I
understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: I can answer for this, it was self-
defense – I can answer for this – but that girl – the scandal – my wife
– my daughters, you know them?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes, I know them –</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: The scandal – we are men – you – you could
take that affair of the young lady upon yourself – take her and hold
your tongue. Then you can travel – I’ll give you anything – anything –
she was with you.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: We must call the police, your
excellency.</p>
<p><strong>preysing</strong>: How much – how much do you want – you need
money – you have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Don’t worry about me, Mr. General
Director Pryesing – worry about yourself. There has been a murder – this
is room one sixty-four.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hello – hurry up… hurry up… someone in one
sixty-four says there has been a murder.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Here - quick - here – go to one sixty-four
immediately. Give me Mr. Rohna – Rohna the manager.</p>
<p><strong>rohna</strong>: Where?… murder?… who?… all right, I’m coming.
Wait a minute. Instruct everyone to use the utmost tact – we must have
no scandal in the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions, I’m coming now –
inform the police.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam should sleep.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I’ve done my hair differently – do you
like that?</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: When a lady falls in love she does her hair
differently.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: In the middle of the night – those
flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. Oh, think,
Suzette – the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo – quiet – simple – happy –
we’ll have a guest, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is
not long ’till the train.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Goodnight, Suzette.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Hello – can you tell me if Baron von
Gaigern is in his room – ring him. Cherie, I must wake you or you’ll
miss the train. …yes… are you ringing, he may be asleep. Cherie, you
must get up and fetch me from my room – I’m longing for you, Cherie – I
have not been to sleep – I kept thinking you would come to me. …Oh, but
he must answer. Ring – ring – ring.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Cherie, hurry – hurry – hurry. Answer
the phone – what is the matter. Ring him – ring him. Where are you –
where are you, Cherie? Why don’t you answer? Well, ring him – please –
please.</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: Forty-two – forty-four – forty-six –
forty-eight – fifty – fifty-two –</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: One hundred and eight – one hundred and ten –
one hundred and twelve…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The night clerk has already gone – you are
late.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Man – I was at the clinic the whole night –
there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: And the child isn’t coming?</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: No – no – not yet. Well, I mustn’t let it
interfere with my duty. Any news here?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: News? Yes – killing in number one-
sixty-four.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: What? – Who? – Whom?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The big manufacturer killed Baron von
Gaigern.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Good heavens. What for?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Man – that’s terrible. He was a nice fellow –
I am sorry about him.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: It seems that he was a thief and an
imposter.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: I don’t believe it – he was a real gentleman.
I know people… I’m so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep
for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel –
that means a lot of work. But it’s too bad about the Baron, you always
felt better when he came along – always friendly – such an agreeable
fellow.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Most imposters are –</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: Show your hands.</p>
<p><strong>senf</strong>: You have dirty nails – you little pig – you’re
no good… Caps off! – Let’s see your hair. Good – caps on! Where is
number seven?… Not here? Take his name – if he comes late again today,
he’s fired. Dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Please, officer.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: That will be sufficient for the present,
sir, you may travel in peace.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: And they’ve taken him away.</p>
<p><strong>floor clerk</strong>: Yes – it’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Madam must not know – you understand –
Madam must not know.</p>
<p><strong>floor clerk</strong>: I will tell the maids. I cannot answer
for downstairs –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh – I was thinking – Poor Baron – Lying
there, his eyes so open.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: You loved the Baron, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: So did I. He was friendly to me as no
man ever was.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Perhaps he really was a burglar – But
they don’t kill a man for that.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: He was in desperate straits. He’d been
trying to raise money all day. He laughed – Poor devil! And then a man
like Preysing kills him.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: I didn’t like Preysing right off.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Then why did you have anything to do
with him?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Money!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Yes, of course, – money!</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You don’t understand that do you?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Of course I do – I never knew what money
really meant till I started spending it. Do you know – I can hardly
believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing –
I’ll take care of you. Will – will you let me?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: You’ll have a good time with me. Want
to? I’ve got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook.
Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can
win more – we’ll travel.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Yes – to Paris? I wanted to go there
always.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Wherever you like. Here I’ll give you
the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have
more.</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Later?</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: When I – I’m ill, Flaemmchen – It will
not be long – I’ll not last long. Will you stay with me until…</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Nonsense! We’ll find a great doctor,
he’ll cure you. They can cure anything these days.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Do you believe that you will have a
better time with me than you would with Preysing?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Oh yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: Do you like me better?</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: You’re a good man, Mr. Kringelein – a
very good man.</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: When is the next train leaving for
Paris? – Yes… Get two tickets for me… and my bill please… and the lady’s
– Miss Flaemm’s. We have to hurry let’s pack – we’ll have breakfast on
the train.</p>

<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Baron von Gaigern has left?</p>

<p><strong>voice of floor clerk</strong>: The Baron left about half an
hour ago, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: Oh – Gru – come, come – we’ll lose the
train.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car…</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The
train will be going.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ve got to ask
myself.</p>
<p><strong>pimenov</strong>: What’s the use of asking, Gru – he is at
the train – He will be there.</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: The troupe, the scenery, everything – all
on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning.
Come, Madam, are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: Have you seen Baron von Gaigern?</p>

be there.</p>

Tremezzo –</p>
<p><strong>meierheim</strong>: Every seat for the opening has been sold
at Vienna. Sold out for three days.</p>
<p><strong>grusinskaya</strong>: I know – I know – but it will be sunny

<p><strong>suzette</strong>: Yes, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Madam Grusinskaya’s car.</p>

a child born? A boy! Yes! My child born! It is healthy… and my wife?
Doing well – all well! The child has come. They are both alive. My
child…</p>
<p><strong>flaemmchen</strong>: Let him take it.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Your bag, your Excellency –</p>

<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Cab, for his Excellency,
Mr. Kringelein!</p>
<p><strong>kringelein</strong>: And now we travel, Flaemmchen… Glad?</p>
