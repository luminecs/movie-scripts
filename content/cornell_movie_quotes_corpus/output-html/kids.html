<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please
Telly, Telly.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You know what I want to do?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: What do I want to do?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You want to fuck me. But you can’t fuck
me.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Because, you know why. You know.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Because your a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Because I’m a virgin and I don’t want no
baby.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You think I want a baby? When you’re with me,
you don’t have to worry about that kinda stuff.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Because I like you. I think you’re beautiful.
I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn’t even believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I wouldn’t believe it?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t know. I just think that you would
love it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But, I don’t know. I’m just scared that things
would change. Between us.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: What things? I’m telling you, nothing’s going
to change. I want to make you happy. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You know it won’t hurt. I’ll be gentle. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you care about me?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Virgins. I love ’em. No diseases, no loose as
a goose pussy, no skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Was up bitch?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Oh shit what happened?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You fucked it?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like
two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin’ virgin
surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Well, how was it?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: She can fuck?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I
first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the
pillow.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Oh shit. How long did it take?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Did what take?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: How long did you fuck her?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Well it took me longer than I thought it
would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was
on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and
putting it back in. It hurts the first time.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: But then when she got into it. She really got
into it. It was good.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: How did she smell? Did her puss stink?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Take a whiff.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Hell’s yeah. She was so clean.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Oh man, that’s the best.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You could tell she took care of herself. She
had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Let me smell it again.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: That’s why virgins are the best. I love that
smell.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You know what else?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I can tell that she had just entered
puberty.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Well, I was flipping through a picture book
of her and her family, right.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: And there was this picture of her painting
Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were
little.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: And she goes, yeah that picture was taken
less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh
my god, this girl is a baby.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: And for a second I felt a little bit guilty.
You know, because she’s young and all. And then I was like, oh shit,
that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Fuckin perverted bastard.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I’m telling you Casper. I think I’m getting
addicted to that shit.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: To what? Virgins?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah. It’s like all I think about now. Not
just that, it’s like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these
complex fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I mean I’m dreaming about going all out,
crazy shit.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You mean like fucking two virgins at
once.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: That would be good. But I mean more like. I
don’t know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how
much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would
happen.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: She’s probably smash you in the fucking
face.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t know about that. She was pretty into
it. But I wasn’t gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it
slow. Show ’em some respect.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Did you tell her that you loved her?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level
virgin seduction guys.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Hell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a
sec.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You wanna go to Paul’s house?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: What for? That guys a dick.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I’m sue he’s got food. He’s always got those
microwave burrito things in his freezer.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You think he’s got any herb?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t know, he quit dealin but I’ll bet
he’ll smoke us out.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: He lives on 76th?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: 78th.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Den less go Joe.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Telly.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Did she suck your dick?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: A little bit. But I didn’t really want her
to.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t know. That’s too easy. I mean getting
a virgin to suck your dick. That’s so easy.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: It is right.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I want to knock her guard down. I mean
there’s a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick,
that’s basic because there’s nothing lost.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: It’s no big deal, right?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Right. But when you deflower a girl, that’s
it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the
this situation is. It’s like getting fame, you know what I’m saying.
It’s like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the
virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their
first.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: They’re gonna tell their grand kids. That
Telly. He sure was good in the sack!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah, I feel dehydrated.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You got any money?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Three pennies and a ball of lint.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You down with the boost?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Unzip my pack, yo.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Uh, let’s see here, would you happen to have
diss digg?</p>
<p><strong>korean store owner</strong>: Whah?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Diss digg. I’m curious if you have it?</p>
<p><strong>korean store owner</strong>: Whah is dissdee?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.</p>
<p><strong>korean store owner</strong>: I no understand you. Maybe
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I’ll ask you one last time. Do you have diss
digg?</p>
<p><strong>korean store owner</strong>: Whah you say? Dissdee?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: He said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can’t you
understand English?</p>
<p><strong>korean man</strong>: Stupy fucky boys! Fucky!</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You know like in “The Wonder Twins” they
share everything.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: The cartoon?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah. “The Wonder Twins”. You know. Activate
in the form of, a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Well, those guys share everything,
right?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: And once I saw this episode where they
pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other’s life for a
day. You know those guys share everything, right?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: And it got me thinkin. How fun it would be
to share each other’s girl.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah, that would be fun but I don’t like any
of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a
clit ring.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: No, I’m serious man. I’m dead ass. Do you
wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated “Wonder Twins”!</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Can you do it man?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Can I do it? I just brooke her cherry. I
imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring
of fire.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Oh man. I fucking love this guy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: It’s me. Telly.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Paul it’s Telly. Open up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are you guys doing?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see
what you were up to.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You want a wip-it?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I love these shits.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re good for you. Vitamin C for the new
generation.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: That’s why I like ’em. They wake my brain
up.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So, how many people live here now?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know, eight or nine.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Where does everyone sleep?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Everywhere. Fuckin flophouse. We’re still
short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can
share the bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yo Telly. Jennie says what’s up.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Jennie who?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Jennie. You know.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: That girl you boned last year. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Man I haven’t seen her in forever. What the
fuck’s she up to?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Telly says was up.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I knew he wouldn’t want to speak to me. That
dick.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You still mad at him?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after
what he did?!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He stole her virginity. He took it away and
now it’s gone forever.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah. But it’s not even the fact that he
devirginized me. It’s the fact that after it was done he never spoke to
me again. He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s the kinda shit he’s into. Telly is
known for that stuff. He fucked Amber the same way.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: And Susan too.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: But he was all like, Oh Jennie I like you so
much. Trust me you’ll love it, I’m not gonna use you. I promise. He was
poppin mad jazz.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: First times are always wacked. Just be glad
you didn’t lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That shit is nothin. I remember, I had just
turned 14. With this fuckin asshole who was like 18. I don’t even
remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember
he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him
Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and
shit.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And we did it in the bush. Like outside around
midnight. I got fucking mosquito bits all over my ass. And we thought
everyone was sleeping, but they obviously weren’t because everybody
knew. And it was out on the grass somewhere. And it hurt like a motha,
oh my god the pain!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s the shit! That’s the shit!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: The pain. The fucking pain!</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: And you feel like you’re being ripped open
inside.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You are being ripped open.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Did you bleed?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I didn’t bleed.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No, I didn’t bleed.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I bled. I fucking bled all over the
sheets.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I bled. I bled like on the condom, there was
blood everywhere. And you know what he started singing? He started
singing “Sunday Bloody Sunday.” That stupid fucking song.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I was like… I was like… No. They sang that the
whole sleep away. My reputation!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: It doesn’t even matter though. It’s such
bullshit. The reputation is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I don’t give a fuck. I have sex and I like
fucking.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Foreplay. Foreplay.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yep. That’s the best way. It’s that boom boom
boom.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Right. You know it’s not like… You know
there’s a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Making love is like.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Slow.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s grandmother style.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s like…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You know what it’s like. It’s like when you
really love someone, it’s like awww.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Its like. But it gets boring. It’s
boring.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s really slow. It’s slow boring.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s very monotonous.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let’s have
sex,</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s like yeah whatever. But when you fuck.
You wanna fuck that person. You’re like ripping each other’s hair out.
Ooooh.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Right. You’re like it’s just this instinct.
It’s like this animal instinct is taking over you. It’s like…</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Passion…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Boom!!! Boom!!!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s the one thing. They expect you to be so
gentle, so kind…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: When most of time you just wanna be all.
Pounding on that shit.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That would be the best if you could just
be. Excuse me can I borrow your hole Miss? It’ll only take a little
while. I’ll give it right back.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: But that’s the thing. Girl’s like it slow.
They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I mean I’ve been with a lot of girls I
know.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah me too nigga.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You know… You know a lot of times sex gets in
the way. Has that ever happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is
just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It’s like
the worst letdown.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yep, yep. But he has to know what he’s doing
and where he’s going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they
won’t ever know.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Hell yeah, they don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Like where are your erogenous zones?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Mine?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Mine are like my neck and my chest.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone
sucks my toes I’ll come in like ten seconds!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time
with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper
was there…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And we were blasted, and he must have been
dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the
room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And we were like underneath the sheets. We
were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was
like hard…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking
fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I was like ripping his hair out. And we kissed
like so hard that our lips were busted. And that shit was so good. It
was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He was like ripping my hair. I was like oh
yeah. Work it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You know why I decided to go out with
Alex.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He has the best fucking fingers I’ve ever
had.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I was like yes! I’m going out with him!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s right. That’s why foreplay is better
than sex.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Because he can like climax you up to
that…</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: … Point.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yep. Where just one more move and you would
be like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But then the sex gets into the way and you’re
like: What happened! What the hell happened?!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah it’s the biggest disappointment!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah. And it takes them either too long or
too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: To come?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him
like an hour and a half.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard
and deep.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes.
Cause I get bored.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah I get bored.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I start thinking about what I’m gonna eat
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah, eat. I got real thirsty too.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You know what I notice?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I notice that girls love to give head. It’s
like a secret pastime hobby for them. Or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Some girls.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: All girls. They love it. I know.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I hate this game.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: No. Casper’s right. Girls love it. They just
act like they don’t in front of their friends.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. But when it’s just you and them. That’s
like the first thing they go for.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I know. They love it. That’s why girls live
longer than guys. ’Cause sperm has vitamin C.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I hate sucking dick!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah. ’Cause they fucking shoot you in the
eye, the face, the ear.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: And sometimes it takes a long time, and
you’re fucking gagging.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah. And then it hits that little thing. That
little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah. And you’re not getting anything out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And it’s like. How much more can I bob here?
You know.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: And you don’t get shit out of it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Have you ever swallowed it before?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It was… it was.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s like sweet and sour, and salty
butter.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: No, no, no. You can’t get that taste out of
your mouth. Until you eat something.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You can drink like there’s no tomorrow but you
still can’t get that sperm between the teeth out. It’s so
disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: The only way you can get it out is like if you
eat like a real meal.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: All I know is that condoms suck. They don’t
work. They break. They slip off. It’s impossible to feel anything. They
make your dick shrink. But I still use ’em. Or at least I did once.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I mean. Telly is the only guy I’ve ever had
sex with. You knew that.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No. I didn’t know that. I thought you got
with A.J. too.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No, we just messed around.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s the whole thing. You know if you look
at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And
everyone’s dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth
is. I don’t know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from
that shit. It’s like some weird make-believe story that the whole world
believes.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah. It’s a great big fraud.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’ve known the past of all the people I’ve
fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and
was negative.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And I know that one of them fucked like two
other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And the other person I just fucked, which was
a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I made her get tested with me because I didn’t
want to go alone.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Did they ask you a lot of questions?</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: How old you?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: 17.</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: 15.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: How many people have you had vaginal
intercourse with?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Umm. Altogether?</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Yes. Altogether.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Hmm. I’d say eight, maybe nine.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: How many times have you gone
unprotected?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: With four of them, I didn’t use any kind of
protection. Wait, maybe it was three.</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: How many people have you had vaginal
intercourse with?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: Were you protected?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Have you ever had anal intercourse?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: With how many people?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Umm. Three I believe. But I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Were they wearing condoms?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Uh. Yes. Twice they weren’t. Two times they
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: Have you ever had anal intercourse?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Okee dokey. You should come back in
seven days and we should have your results.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Man, this guy is really good.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: He looks like my uncle.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I bet he makes hella money.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: … I don’t know, I think he’s mad at me, but
who cares…</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Woowee! It must have been something I
ate! Ruby, follow me.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: Jennie.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Well, girl. You tested negative for all
sexually transmitted diseases and infections.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: You’re clean.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Oh my God. I can’t tell you how nervous I’ve
been. I couldn’t sleep last night.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Now you gotta be careful.</p>
<p><strong>black nurse</strong>: Here take these pamphlets home and read
them.</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: Jennie. You’ve tested positive for the
HIV infection.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: The test isn’t one hundred percent
accurate. You should…</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I tested positive?</p>
<p><strong>white nurse</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: But I only had sex with Telly.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I just got tested to keep Ruby company.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I wanna fuck Darcy.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Darcy. Benny’s little sister.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Oh. You like her?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah. I like her. I’ve wanted to get with her
for a while now.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Darcy?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah. She’s so little, so pretty, and
innocent.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah. She’s only 13.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: It’s funny. Last weekend at that block party.
Remember?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: She was handing out those watermelon slices.
And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I watched her eat the watermelon. And all
this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: And after about two seconds, I got the
biggest hard-on.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I’m not joking. I wanted to take my dick out
and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like
a vision of perfection.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: At that moment, at that block party, she
represented everything holy about a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for
them.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I’m gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God
I’m gonna fuck her.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day?
That shits gotta be against the law.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t care motha fucka. I’ll bet you money
she fucks me.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Bet.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You wanna run by the park and see what
everybody’s doing? Get zooted?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.</p>
<p><strong>legless man</strong>: I have no legs. I have no legs. I have
no legs. I have no legs.</p>
<p><strong>legless man</strong>: Thank you. God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah. Bless you back.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t understand why you do that.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Why I do what?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: That.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Why I give pennies?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah. Why you give money.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He
had no legs. He had no half his lower body. He’s gotta shit out of his
ribcage.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: That’s just it. It’s elitist. It’s reverse
elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I
notice what you do.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Whenever you see someone who’s really messed
up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it’s
just a regular bum, you pass them by.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So. These people live on the same streets.
It’s just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively
fucked up. The regular bums aren’t poor enough for you, you gotta give
it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: So. You never know when you can end up like
that.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I’ll tell you why. Because when I was
little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the
handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle
of Pepto and his ass blew off.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I’m telling you the truth. And after that,
I’ve always givin’ my money to retards. Because that’s the reverse of
what he did.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: So really, it’s good luck.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Good luck?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The
guy had no legs.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Ruby. Do you have a quarter?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Peter, is Mom there? No, I need to speak to
Mommy… Peter where’s Mommy? No, I can’t talk to you right now. Yeah… I
hear it… look just tell her… No never mind… Go watch television.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Shh. Come on, it’s gonna be OK.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: That’s it. I’m gonna have to tell my little
brother, I’m gonna die. I can’t make him his lunches anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Come on. Don’t cry. We’ll work it out.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I only did it once and…</p>
<p><strong>phone booth man</strong>: You usin the phone?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Get the fuck outta here man!</p>
<p><strong>phone booth man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I said get the fuck outta here before I smash
your fucking face in mothafucka!!!</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Don’t go anywhere. Stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I gotta find him.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No. I just gotta go find him.</p>

<p><strong>mom</strong>: So, what are you gonna do for money this
summer?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t know. Find a job. Hey can I borrow
some money?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any
money until you find a job.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: But then I won’t need your money.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Man, Telly, your little brother is getting
big.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Holy shit man, your mom’s got good
titties.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: How do these things work?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Twent, twenty-five, thirty-five, forty-five,
fifty.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: How much you gonna take?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I don’t know. How much do you want?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: About ten. Fifteen is good.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Fifteen for me.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Ten for you.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Get the fuck out of here cat!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah probably.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yo, you got any weed around here?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Naw. But we should run by the park and get a
dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yo. I’m gonna get buff dude.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese
bitch told me I’d look good with muscles.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I’m gonna get mad diesel. I’m gonna fuck any
nigga that tries to step to me.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You want some?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Why not? You stink.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: That shit gives me a rash all under my arms
and around my stomach. I like my odor. It’s fuckin natural.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I’m gonna go out for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: When are you gonna be back?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Not too late.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Four-thirty in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Not too late.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Hey Mom. Are you sure I can’t get any money?
Just a few bucks.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: If I had it, maybe. But right now I don’t have

<p><strong>casper</strong>: My throat.</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: How can you hang out with Casper? He’s such a
jerk.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: Yeah. I’ve always hated that kid. He used to
eat glue in like seventh grade.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: He still does.</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: I hate ’em.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: It’s not his fault. He had a hard life.</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You’ve heard the stories right?</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Well, one day Casper had a stomachache and he
got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So he walks into his house and hears some
strange noises.</p>
<p><strong>casper’s mom</strong>: Get away! Get away! Help! You monster!
Please help!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: The noises were coming from upstairs. In his
parents room.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He
was just a little kid and he wasn’t sure what to do.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So he ran and got a big knife. The same knife
his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.</p>
<p><strong>casper’s mom</strong>: Stop! Please stop! Oooh help!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So he heard his mom’s screams, and knew that
she was in trouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed.
Like someone was kicking her in the head.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Bitch. You fuckin bitch. Fuckin bitch.
Slutty whore.</p>
<p><strong>casper’s mom</strong>: No! Stop! Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So Casper opened the door and he saw some big
guy with a ski mask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old
kid.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: And he goes and jumps on his parent’s bed.
And for a second he just looks and watches.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: And you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn’t
want anything to happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over
and over. But it was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>casper’s mom</strong>: You fuck!!! It’s your father!!! We
were playing a game you fuck!!! That’s your father!!! We were just
playing!!!</p>
<p><strong>casper’s mom</strong>: Casper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!!
Help me God!!!</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: That’s my dad.</p>
<p><strong>casper’s mom</strong>: You fuck. You killed your father!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So Casper killed his father. He came home
with a stomachache and ended up murdering his pops. It was a very
embarrassing thing.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: So that’s why Casper is how he is.</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: Oh god. That’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: Holy shi. That’s all true?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: No. I was just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>misha</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for
the post office.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yo, that weed is mad good.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Hells yeah. Gimmie a taste of the
mothafuckin chronic.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yo, sorry money.</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You

<p><strong>casper</strong>: Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.</p>

<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat

<p><strong>casper</strong>: Sup then? Sup?</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Uh oh. Casper’s in the mix.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh shit. Throw down.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Sup. Sup.</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking

<p><strong>casper</strong>: I’m gonna fuck you up bitch.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my

<p><strong>casper</strong>: Suck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my
dick.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Now get in my way! Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Excuse me. Can I ask you a
question?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Can I ask you a question? I’m sorry. I
don’t mean to be a pest.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Well, I don’t mean to be a pest. It was
just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at
you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any
assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy.
Who knows? Somethin maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No. I’m OK. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: You’re OK?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Because gee, you don’t look OK. I mean
your a very beautiful young lady. It’s just that you look troubled
that’s all…</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah well, it’s been a bad day.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day?
Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out
she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial
paralysis. But I don’t let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It’s not good
for the soul.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Oh it’s OK. That’s life. Maybe tomorrow
I’ll win lotto. Who knows? You don’t. No one does.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: You know. I could tell you were sad by
the way your eyes drooped. Like an adopted kid. That’s the way an
adopted kid’s eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet. Like
the honey that I lick off my finger.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Would I be prying if I asked you what
was wrong?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Miss, would I be prying?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Everything is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: No, not everything? The sun is still
shinning. It’s a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Did you and your boyfriend just break
up?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Are you in trouble with the law?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Am I getting warm?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Now that’s it. A smile. You look like a
prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a
crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the
center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You
know you look a little bit like her.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin.
Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my
tongue in her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Hey look. Whatever it is. Just forget
about it. Life’s too short. Make yourself happy. I’ll give you an
example. When my golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul. I was
lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Now how do you like that? Now he’s with
me forever.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I
can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Yeah. I’m not saying you should get a
tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: What if you can’t make yourself happy? What
if everything falls apart?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Well then, I don’t know. You know what
you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little
boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, “Leon, my
darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don’t think. Don’t bump
into any walls. If you stutter. Don’t talk” And I took her advice. And
look at me now. Couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: That’s life.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Your a real philosopher.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I
can’t spell.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Well here we are, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Aw, don’t worry ’bout it. The rides on
me.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: All right, all right, I’ll take it. But
forget about the tip.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Thanks. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Oh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile,
God notices. That’s why the sun is shining.</p>

<p><strong>casper</strong>: Geez Kim. Your body looks fuckin good.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: It’s funny how sometimes you can’t tell if a
girl has a nice body until you see her without her clothes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey Joy. You ever see a black man’s
lasso?</p>
<p><strong>joy</strong>: What?</p>

lately.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah. After I saw you last week.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: At the block party?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: I was lookin for you all day today.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: You were?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Sure. I even thought about you when I woke

<p><strong>telly</strong>: I was like. I gotta find Darcy. Where is she
at? I was lookin all over.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I’ll give you a dollar if you let me suck on
your tit.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: No I’m serious. Can I suck your tit? Either
of you guys. I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yeah me too.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Casper, why do you think I would let you suck
on my boobs?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I don’t know. Your just sitting there. And
your tits look clean to me. It makes me want to suck on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: I thought you had a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Naw. I’m not seeing anybody. What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: No. I can’t. My mom won’t let me have
boyfriends.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: She won’t? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: I don’t know. I guess it’s cause my sister
Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is
like very protective over me.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah. I can understand that.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I truth or dare you guys to kiss each
other.</p>
<p><strong>joy</strong>: Sure. We kiss all the time.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: You guys are dykes right?</p>

<p><strong>joy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Then how can you kiss each other like
that?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yeah. How can you do that shit?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: It doesn’t matter. It just feels good. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>joy</strong>: Yeah. It’s not like we’re gay. It’s just
kissing another person, a friend.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joy</strong>: It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: I don’t know. I just never seen girls that
did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yeah. Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: You should come back with me to Steven’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Yeah. His parents are away. It’s gonna be a
bug out.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: I don’t know. I’m supposed to go to Nasa
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Come on. You can rave on another night.</p>
<p><strong>telly</strong>: Come on. It’ll be fun. We’ll just bug out.
There should be a bunch of people. It’ll be fun I promise.</p>

pace. That club shit gets boring.</p>
