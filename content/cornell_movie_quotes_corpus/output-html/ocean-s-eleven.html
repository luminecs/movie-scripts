<p><strong>voice</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Please state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Daniel Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this
meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break
the law again. While this was your first conviction, you have been
implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence
schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: As you say, ma’am, I was never charged.</p>
<p><strong>board member #2</strong>: Mr. Ocean, what we’re trying to
find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was
there a reason why you simply got caught this time?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My wife left me. I was upset. I got into a
self-destructive pattern.</p>
<p><strong>board member #3</strong>: If released, is it likely you would
fall back into a similar pattern?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: She already left me once. I don’t think
she’ll do it again just for kicks.</p>
<p><strong>board member #1</strong>: Mr. Ocean, what do you think you
would do if released?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t know. How much do you guys make a
year?</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Ocean, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Sign. This came today for you. Rest’ll be
forwarded to your parole officer.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: address over Danny’s</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My wife’s.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m a free man.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hello, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I beg your pardon, sir. You must have me
confused with someone else. My name is Ramon. See?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My mistake… Table’s cold anyway.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir.
It gets busy around one.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Catching up on current events?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ramon?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Glad to meet you. Frank Catton wouldn’t get
by the gaming board. You just out?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And already turning over a new leaf.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You seen him?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Last I heard he was in L.A. Teaching movie
stars how to play cards. Why? You don’t have something planned
already?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You kidding? I just became a citizen
again.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s tough now, our line of work. Everybody
so serious. Too many guns, too many computers. Whadda you gonna do?
Steal from ordinary people?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That would be criminal.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So what’s left? Banks? Hah. Banks got no
money. It’s all electronic. Only place that still takes cash is…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Casinos.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, yes…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Soon. Interested?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is Danny Ocean.
I’m just out, I’m supposed to check in with you within twenty-four
hours. No, sir, I haven’t gotten into any trouble. No drinking, no sir.
No, sir, I wouldn’t even think of leaving the state.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hey! Hey, Rusty!</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hey, I don’t know if you’re, uh, you know,
incorporated or anything, like Rusty Ryan. And, I don’t know,
incorporated, but you should think about it, really, ’cause I was
talking to my manager yesterday –</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Bernie?</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: No, not Bernie, I mean not, not that Bernie,
my business manager, he’s also Bernie, he was telling me that since
this, what we do, could be considered research for, you know, a future
gig, that I should be able to write it off as a business expense. So he
suggested that it’d be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby –</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Or, or we could keep it cash.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Alright. Who’s here?</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn’t
make it. He’s got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody
just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Barry is here.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O.
thing in Vancouver.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Couldn’t work the dates. Oh, and he brought
his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Not the one from –</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I quit watching when Kate left Don after his
accident.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Good evening, guys. Let’s play some
cards…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: … and let’s play some cards.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: A hundred bucks to me… Ah, what the hell.
Pocket change. Call.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Why you bet a certain way is your business.
But you have to make them think you’re betting for a reason.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them
doesn’t change them. Leave ’em where they are and make your bet.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’re showing. Yeah, I know she’s your
girlfriend, Barry, but you can’t… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Josh. Deal to your left.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: One McCallum neat. And four bottled
waters.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Two pair – nines and twos.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You got me. Let’s take a little break.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: How’s the game going?!!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s been the longest hour of my life.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’m running away with your wife.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Cool, man!</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that’s
alright.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The bouncer mentioned there was a game in
progress. I hope I’m not intruding.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: No intrusion at all –</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What was his name, the bouncer’s?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: A card player with amnesia. This should be
fun.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean? If
you don’t mind my asking.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why should I mind? Two cards, please… I just
got out of prison.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Really? Really…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Barry, you’re showing again.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What’d you, uh, go to prison for?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I stole things.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What, like jewels? Diamonds?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Incan matrimonial headmasks.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: From a museum?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Gallery.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: There a lot of money in those? Incan
matrimonial…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Headmasks. Some.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Don’t let him fool you, Seth. There’s
boatloads. If you can move the things… One card to me. … but you
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My fence seemed confident enough.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: If you’re dealing with cash, you don’t need a
fence.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Some people just lack vision.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Probably everybody in cell block E.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, that’s all behind us now.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I should hope so.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I raise you five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Guys: Day One: what’s the first rule of
poker?</p>
<p><strong>barry topher</strong>: Um, never bet on, uh, on ‘Leave
emotion at the a – door.’</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That’s right. My friend here just raised me
out of pique. Today’s lesson. How to draw out a bluff. This early in the
game, that much money, I’m thinking he’s holding nothing better than a
pair of face cards. Seth, raise him.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay. Uh, your five hundred and… another
two?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Tophe…</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Seven to me. Plus three. What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Indeed. But be careful you don’t push him too
high too fast. Want to keep him on the leash. I call.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What’s that to me? A thousand?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: All you have to do is call.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What? Your girlfriend holding your purse?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I
always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell
from your face you’re holding three of a kind or better. Five hundred to
call. And two grand more.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Guys, you’re free to do what you like. It’s a
lot of money. But I’m staying in. He’s trying to buy his way out of his
bluff.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We call.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Shit. Sorry, guys. I – I was sure he was
bluffing.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Thanks for the game, fellas. Hey, I hate to
ask this, but could you sign something for me? It’s for the guys in the
joint. They just love all your shows.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That was, that was just…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Unprofessional.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent
you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why do you think I came to see you first?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ten grand. Half of it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You barge into my new workplace, ruin my
professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you’ve got
something better for me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve got something better for you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: How’s Tess?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Alright. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s tricky. No one’s ever done it before.
Needs planning, a large crew.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Guns?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise.
There’s a lot of security. But the take…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What’s the target?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Eight figures each.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What’s. The. Target.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: When’s the last time you were in Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What? You wanna knock over a casino?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The vault at the Bellagio.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: If I’m reading these right – and I think that
I am – this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. Oops.
Actually, you know what, I’m wrong. It’s definitely the least accessible
vault ever designed.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You said three casinos…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: These feed into the cages at both the Mirage
and the M.G.M. Grand. But every dime ends up here.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: The Bellagio, Mirage, and… These are Terry
Benedict’s places.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, they are. Think he’ll mind?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: More than somewhat.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’d need at least a dozen guys, doing a
combination of cons.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Like what, you think?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Well, off the top of my head, I’d say you’re
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon
Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where do you think
you’re gonna get the money to back this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: As long as we’re hitting these three casinos,
we’ll get our bankroll. Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: But does he have enemies with loose cash and
nothing to lose… Aha.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Aha.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Reuben.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: So, here’s what I think: You should take this
plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in
your head. Then: never bring it up to me again.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Uh-huh. So what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’m saying: this is like trying to build a
house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Really? I thought it was much harder than
that –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Sorry. You two done up here? Find
what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, thanks. You mind if we borrow a couple
drawings for the night? Make some copies.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Whatever you need.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: ’Preciate it.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I need a reason. And don’t say money. Why do
this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why not do it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because yesterday I walked out of the joint
wearing my entire wardrobe and you’re colddecking TeenBeat coverboys.
Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing
stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes
around, you bet big. And then you take the house.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’re been practicing that speech, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A little. Did I rush it? It felt like I
rushed it.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No, it was good.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I wonder what Reuben will say?</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: You’re out of your goddamn minds.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Are you listening to me? You are, both of
you, nuts. I know more about casino security than any man alive. I
invented it, and it cannot be beaten. They got cameras, they got
watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. They got
enough armed personnel to occupy Paris. Okay, bad example…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s never been tried.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Oh, it’s been tried. A few guys even came
close. You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas
history?</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Number three. The bronze medal. Pencilneck
grabs a lockbox at the Sands. He got two steps closer to the door than
any living soul before him.</p>
<p><strong>resume action</strong>: Adlai Stevenson gets a taste of what
NFL quarterbacks experience every Sunday… five fold.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Second most successful robbery. The
Flamingo ’71. This guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got
him.</p>
<p><strong>resume action</strong>: The billy club comes down – whap! –
across the hippie’s skull and it’s Chicago ’68 all over again.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Course, he was breathing out of a hose the
next three weeks, goddamn hippie.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: And the closest any man has gotten to
robbing a Las Vegas casino…</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Outside of Caesar’s in ’87. He came, he
grabbed, he got conquered.</p>
<p><strong>resume action</strong>: BULLETS rip the man to shreds and he
collapses on Caesar’s steps a bloody pulp.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: But what am I saying? You guys are pros,
the best. I’m sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we
forget, once you’re out the front door, you’re still in the middle of
the fucking desert!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’re right. He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Reuben, you’re right. Our eyes are bigger
than our stomachs.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That’s exactly it. Pure ego.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Yeah yeah blah blah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Thank you so much for setting us straight.
Sorry we bothered you.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Look, we all go way back. I owe you from
that thing with the guy in the place, and I’ll never forget it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It was our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’d never been to Belize.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Give Dominic your addresses, I got some
remaindered furniture I wanna send you.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Just out of curiosity, which casinos did
you geniuses pick to rob?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M.
Grand.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Those are Terry Benedict’s casinos.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Say, you know, he’s right.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: You guys… Whadda you got against Terry
Benedict?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What do you have against him? That’s the real
question.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out,
now he’s gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin’
eyesore. Don’t think I don’t see what you’re doin’.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What are we doing, Reuben?</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you
better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You’d hit a
guy, he’d whack you. Done. But Benedict… At the end of this he better
not know you’re involved, not know your names, or think you’re dead.
Because he’ll kill you, and then he’ll go to work on you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s why we’ve got to be very careful. We
have to be precise. We have to be well-funded.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you’re
gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Alright. Who’s in?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Frank C. is in.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Frank C. has developed a bad case of
bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about drivers?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I talked to the Malloys yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Mormon twins?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: They’re both in Salt Lake City, six months
off the job. I got the sense they’re having trouble filling the
hours.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Electronics?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Livingston Dell.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Livingston’s been doing freelance
surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How are his nerves?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Okay. Not so bad you’d notice.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: D-don’t, don’t-don’t… touch… it.</p>
<p><strong>fbi man #1</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Do you see me pulling the gun out of
your holster and firing it?</p>
<p><strong>fbi man #2</strong>: Hey, Radio Shack: relax.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Munitions.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Phil Turentine.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No shit? On the job?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Sun cancer.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You send flowers?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Dated his wife a while.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Basher…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We may be too late.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Sweet…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: gang, his temper</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: And that’s all you used during the event?
Nothing else?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Are you accusing me of booby- trapping?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Well, how ’bout it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Booby traps aren’t Mr. Tarr’s style.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Isn’t that right, Basher?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a guess. A simple
G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20
feet. That’s our man. Tell me something else. Have you checked him for
booby traps on his person? I mean really checked, not just for
weapons…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need
to see him?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Just go find him, will you? How fast can you
put something together with what I passed you?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Done. Thirty seconds all right?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: From when?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: SNAP from behind his</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Ten seconds?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Not quite. Is Danny here?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Be good working with professionals again.
Okay: go.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Everyone down! Get down! There’s a bomb in
the…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing
Yen.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So he can walk on a rope.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: More than that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not
an acrobat. Who else is on the list?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He is the list.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Watch.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: There’s your grease man.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We need Saul.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He won’t come. He swore off the game a year
ago.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He get religion?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You can ask him.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I can ask.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I saw you in the paddock before the second
race, outside the men’s room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you
even got up this morning.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: How ya been, Saul?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Never better.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What’s with the orange?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: My doctor says I need vitamins.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: So why don’t you take vitamins?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You come here to give me a physical?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I got a box seat. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I thought you drank bloody Mary’s at the
track, Saul.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: A man shouldn’t drink on the job.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Who we rooting for here?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Number four.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and
get it over with?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Saul, you’re the best there is. You’re in
Cooperstown. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Nothin’. I got a duplex now, I got
wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I’m seeing a nice lady, she works the
unmentionables counter at Macy’s. I’ve changed.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Guys like us don’t change, Saul. We stay
sharp or we get sloppy, but we don’t change.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Quit connin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That your hound way in the back there?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: He breaks late. Everyone knows this.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You gonna treat me like a grownup at least?
Tell me what the scam is?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And Saul makes ten.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ten should do it, don’t you think? You think
we need one more? You think we need one more. Okay. We’ll get one
more.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Sorry ’bout that.</p>
<p><strong>stockbroker</strong>: No problem, guy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hi, Linus. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A friend of Bobby Caldwell’s. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Bobby told me about you. Said you were the
best set of hands he ever saw. Didn’t expect to find you working wallets
on the subway.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: That wasn’t work, that was practice.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re either in or out, right now.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A plane ticket. A job offer.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You’re pretty trusting pretty fast.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Bobby has every faith in you.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Fathers are like that. He didn’t tell you? He
doesn’t like me trading on his name.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You do this job, he’ll be trading on
yours.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What if I say no?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’ll get someone else who won’t be quite as
good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s the best lift I’ve seen you make
yet.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Las Vegas, huh?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: America’s playground.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Trick or treat.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: What, you guys get a group rate or
something?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: You make it out to Utah much, Saul?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Not as much as I’d like.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: You should. You’d like it. You’d like
Provo.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Anybody see the salsa goes with this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Gentlemen: welcome to Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close
enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven’t met
Linus Caldwell before, he’s Bobby’s kid outta Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay. Before we start, nobody’s on the line
here yet. What I’m about to propose to you happens to be both highly
lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn’t sound like your
particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and
safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: You’re Bobby Caldwell’s kid, huh?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: From Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: It’s nice there. You like it?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: That’s wonderful. Get in the goddamn
room.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas
Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M.
Grand. Together, they’re the three most profitable casinos in Las
Vegas…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below
the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every
dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. And we’re
going to rob it.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Smash-and-grab job, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s a little more complicated than that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack
dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay. Bad news first. This place houses a
security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. First: we have
to get within the casino cages –</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: – here, here, and here –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: – which anyone knows takes more than a smile.
Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit
code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this
is where it gets tricky: the elevator won’t move without authorized
fingerprint identifications –</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: – which we can’t fake –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: – and vocal confirmations from both the
security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: – which we won’t get.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged
with motion detectors –</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: – meaning if we manually override the lift,
the shaft’s exit will lock down automatically and we’ll be trapped.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Once we’ve gotten down the shaft, though,
then it’s a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and
predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door
conceived by man. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter
scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction.
If a groundhog tried to nest there, they’d know about it. Anyone
else?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: You said something about good news…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a
casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on
its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos
above it. That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere
from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend,
between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two
weeks from tonight, the night we’re going to rob it, at least a hundred
and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat. Now there are eleven of us.
Each with an equal share. You do the math.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I have a question. Say we do get into the
cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we
can’t move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can’t
open…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Without being seen by the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to mention
that.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Say we do all that. We’re just supposed to
walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without
getting stopped?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Alright. Here’s how we’ll begin.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: First task: reconnaissance. I want to know
everything that’s going on in all three casinos. From the rotation of
the dealers to the path of every cash cart…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I wanna know everything about every guard,
every watcher, anyone with a security pass. I wanna know where they’re
from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee…</p>
<p><strong>reveals</strong>: On his crossword, Frank has scribbled a
transcript of the Technicians’ conversation. As he glances up at an
electronic keycard clipped to one Technician’s belt…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Most of all, I want you guys to know these
casinos. They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. I want you
guys to know the quick routes out.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Second task: power. On the night of the
fight, we’re gonna throw the switch on sin city. Basher, it’s your
show.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Third task: surveillance. Casino security has
an eye and ear on everything, so we’ll want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston…</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Well, it’s not the least accessible
system I’ve seen, but it’s close. I don’t suppose they have a
closed-circuit feed I could tap into?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Then this is definitely a black bag job.
Do they employ an in- house technician?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Two. And one of them is lonely.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: I’ll be right back, honey. Don’t move a
muscle.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Depends on the muscle.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Thanks, Charmaine. I’ll have it back within
the hour. Say hello to your mom for me.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: Say it yourself. She’ll be onstage in five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Hey, watch it, bud…</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: 433, we have visual impairment on the east
door camera.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Excuse me, sir: You’re going to have to move
your balloons.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Who you calling ‘bud,’ pal?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Who you calling ‘pal,’ friend?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Who you calling ‘friend’… … bud…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You hear about this new medical discovery
they made? It’s called a ‘sense of direction.’ Apparently we’re all
supposed to have one…</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, balloon boy.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Gentlemen, gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why do they paint hallways that color?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: They say taupe is very soothing.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: Hiya.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Fine, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey… get your own balloons.</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: You dropped this.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fourth task: construction…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We need to build an exact, working replica of
the Bellagio vault.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: For practice.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fifth task: intelligence. We need those
codes, Linus. From the only man who has all three.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Learn to love his shadow. Sixth task:
transport…</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. All I get to do is watch
him?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: For now. You gotta walk before you crawl.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Reverse that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Sixth task: transport…</p>
<p><strong>billy tim</strong>: I’m sorry: eighteen-five each is the best
offer I can make you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, I understand perfectly. They are
beautiful vans. Well, I thank you for your time, Mister…?</p>
<p><strong>billy tim</strong>: Denham. Billy Tim Denham.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes, Denham, like a jean. You know: you have
lovely hands – do you moisturize?</p>
<p><strong>billy tim</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I swear by it. I try all sorts of lotions. I
went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I’m liking this
new brand fortified with rose hip. My sister, you know, she uses the
aloe vera with the sun screen built in…</p>
<p><strong>billy tim</strong>: Uh-huh. You said you’d be willing to pay
in cash?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I did. You know: they say cinnamon is
wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally
you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere
with my social agenda. Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I
can’t use traditional remedies…</p>
<p><strong>billy tim</strong>: If you could pay cash, I could probably
drop the price a little. To, say, seventeen… … sixteen each.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That would be lovely.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: … Power, surveillance, transport…</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Get your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: This is nice material.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s Armani, Saul.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: It’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Saul, you sure you’re ready to do this?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: If you ever question me again, Daniel, you
won’t wake up the following morning.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Hello. My name is Lyman Zerga… My name is
Lyman Zerga…</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: My name is Lyman Zerga… My name is Lyman
Zerga…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s a little over twenty grand there,
Saul. Try to make it last.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You seen my…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Bought you a fresh roll.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Mr. Zerga, we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good luck, Lyman.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Luck is for losers.</p>
<p><strong>v.i.p. concierge</strong>: Good afternoon, sir. How can I be
of service?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: My name is Lyman Zerga. I’d like a suite,
please.</p>
<p><strong>v.i.p. concierge</strong>: Do you have a reservation with
us?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I don’t make reservations.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Okay. Tell me about Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: The guy is a machine.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two
p.m. Same Town Car, same driver. Remembers every valet’s name on the way
in. Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Offices are upstairs. He works hard, hits the
lobby floor at seven on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Spends three minutes on the floor with his
casino manager.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What do they talk about?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: All business. Benedict likes to know what’s
going on in his casinos. There’s rarely an incident he doesn’t know
about or handle personally.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high
rollers. He’s fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he’s taking
Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. He’s out by seven-thirty,
when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. Contents: the day’s take
and new security codes. Then he heads to the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Give him another ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: As I said: a machine.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: And that portfolio contains the codes to all
the cage doors?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Two minutes after they’ve been changed, he’s
got ’em in hand. I’ll tell you: you guys picked a helluva target. He is
as smart and ruthless as they come. The last guy caught cheating here,
Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize
the guy’s home and bankrupted –</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: – his brother-in-law’s tractor dealership, I
heard.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: He doesn’t just go after your knees, he goes
after your livelihood. And everyone-you- ever-met’s livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You scared?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You suicidal?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Only in the morning. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Now comes the girl… if she comes in after he
does, that means they’re in a snit.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Where’s she come from?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: The museum downstairs. She’s the curator
there. Wait… here she is. You’ll like this.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I don’t know if we can use her yet. I haven’t
even caught her name.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Tess.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: about this, very certain and very</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: This looks familiar. Where’d you get
this?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Off your Rolls.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Danny! Tell ’em not to touch the
Rolls!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: 29:47. Everything okay in there?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: But what doesn’t beat the shit out of being a
circus performer?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Tell me this isn’t about her. Or I’ll walk
off the job right now. Tess. She’s with Terry Benedict now. Tell me this
isn’t about screwing the guy who’s screwing your wife.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s not. About that. Entirely.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You said you needed a reason. Well, this is
mine. When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren’t
gonna hurt anybody. We weren’t gonna steal from anybody didn’t have it
coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose.
Well, I lost something. Someone. That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Here’s the problem: we’re stealing two things
now. And when push comes to shove, if you can’t have both, which are you
gonna choose? And remember: Tess doesn’t divide eleven ways.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If things go to plan, I won’t be the one who
has to make that choice.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How’d she look by the way? Tess…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’ve seen her happier.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: ‘Radiant’ is the word. Absolutely radiant.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: He painted it in the summer of 1912, after the
break-up with Fernande Olivier.</p>
<p><strong>seller</strong>: She must have put him through hell.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You can see the conflict. He makes her both
erotic and grotesque. He’s hopelessly drawn to her, and yet she drives
him crazy.</p>
<p><strong>aide-de-camp</strong>: Mr. Santaniello has an early flight.
Do you think Mr. Benedict will be late?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Mr. Benedict is never late.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Am I late?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not at all, Mr. Benedict. Allow me to
introduce to you Mr. Jean Santaniello.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Santaniello, I apologize if I kept
you. I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter. I gave him
an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.</p>
<p><strong>seller</strong>: I understand it’s going to be a hell of a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: We hope.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Magnificent! I’ve been following her for
fifteen years now. At last I’ve made her a home. All the arrangements
and so forth…</p>
<p><strong>seller</strong>: Done. She’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Not mine. She belongs to everyone who
comes into my hotel. Isn’t that right, Ms. Ocean?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Yes, Mr. Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: She’s lovely, isn’t she? I can’t be the
only one who was after her.</p>
<p><strong>seller</strong>: You’re the only one who met my price.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Ah, but this… You can’t put a price on
beauty. But I shouldn’t philosophize. I own casinos, after all.</p>
<p><strong>aide-de-camp</strong>: Can we get a quick shot?
Mr. Santaniello has a plane to catch.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Of course, of course.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I like that you like it. I have some bad
news from the world of high fashion. It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing
red on Saturday night. Red trunks with a white stripe.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: And you, as I recall, will be wearing a
red Donna Karan? And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row,
that red dress…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: He’s a charming man, but no one’s going to
be watching him when they can make a study of you. I’ve asked Paolo to
find three or four things for you to try. I hope you’re not too
disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What? We’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: In my hotels, there’s always someone
watching.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Actually, I do like it.</p>
<p><strong>103 omitted 103</strong>: thru thru 105 105</p>
<p><strong>high roller #1</strong>: Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I don’t believe in weakness. It costs too
much. I don’t believe in questions, either.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Eddie. Anything for me?</p>
<p><strong>pit boss</strong>: Mr. Zerga, sir. Lyman Zerga. In the third
position. Wishes to speak with you privately.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>pit boss</strong>: Businessman of some kind, working mostly
in Europe. He’s very vague, but I asked around. Word is he deals
primarily in arms. One of the biggest.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Zerga? Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>pit boss</strong>: Yessir. That’s why I don’t doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: He’s staying here?</p>
<p><strong>pit boss</strong>: Checked in two nights ago, sir. He’s in
the Mirador suite.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>pit boss</strong>: Up. Almost forty grand.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Good for him…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You’re thirty seconds late. I was about to
send out a search party… Danny…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hello, Tess.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: and stunned to see him, but outraged</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You’re out.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Of prison. You remember. The day I went for
cigarettes and never came back. You must have noticed.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I don’t smoke. Don’t sit –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They said I’d paid my debt to society.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Funny, I never got a check.</p>
<p><strong>tess danny</strong>: You can’t stay. It’s good to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re not wearing your ring.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I sold it. And I don’t have a husband. Or
didn’t you get the papers?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My last day inside.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I told you I’d write.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Danny. Go. Now. Before…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Benedict?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Whiskey and – – whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Danny…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re doing a great job curating the
museum.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Vermeer is quite good. Simple but
vibrant. Although his work definitely fell off as he got older.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Remind you of anyone?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And I still get Monet and Manet confused.
Which one married his mistress?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Monet.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Right. Manet had syphilis.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: They also painted occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You don’t know how many times I played this
conversation out in my head the last two years.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Did it always go this poorly?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Sounds frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You were never easy. Okay. I’ll make this
quick. I came here for you. I’m gonna get on with my life, and I want
you with me.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You’re a thief and a liar.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I only lied about being a thief. But I don’t
do that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Steal?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Lie.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m with someone now who doesn’t have to make
that kind of distinction.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, he’s very clear on both.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Nice. Work on that for two years, too?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Year and a half.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Do you know what your problem is?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I only have one?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You’ve met too many people like you. I’m with
Terry now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Does he make you laugh?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: He doesn’t make me cry.</p>
<p><strong>high roller</strong>: You don’t want to get in the hole too
heavy to this Benedict. A friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g’s
from the guy. Two months went by, Benedict hadn’t heard from him, he
calls my friend up, asks ‘Where’s my money?’ I’ll get to it when I get
to it,’ my friend says. Half hour later Benedict’s in my friend’s hotel
room, dangling him off his 10th floor balcony by his feet. ‘You gonna
get to it now?’</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bank wins – natural nine.</p>
<p><strong>high roller</strong>: Hiya, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Weintraub. How’s everything?</p>
<p><strong>high roller</strong>: Eh. They put too much grenadine in my
Shirley Temple.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: And here I thought you were drinking
vodka. Mr. Zerga.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Mr. Benedict. I recognize you from the TV. You
know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand
to ask me what I want. I respect your waiting.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You’re the guest, sir.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: And I have to impose on your hospitality. Can
you sit in for a hand?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I’d love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming
board would feed me to my white tigers.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: That’s a shame. You’re the king of Vegas and
you have to play craps in the alley.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: No shame at all. Reminds me of my
youth.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: The fight is Saturday, is it not?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Yes. I can get you seats…</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn’t interest
me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase,
standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I’d be happy to put it in the house safe
for you.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: The house safe is for brandy and grandmother’s
pearls. I’m afraid I need something more secure.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I can assure you, the house safe is
utterly…</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, your
generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. Now: what can you
offer me besides the safe?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: See, the kind of people you steal things from,
they have insurance to compensate them. They get made whole again. I had
to leave New York to get away from what happened. How do I get my five
years back, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You can’t. But what you can do is not throw
away another five years.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You don’t know anything about –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Listen, you don’t love me anymore, you want
to make a life with someone else? Fine, I’ll have to live with that. But
not him.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Spoken like a true ex-husband.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not joking, Tess.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m not laughing. You have to admit there’s a
conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes. But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Do you remember what I said to you when we
first met?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You said: you better know what you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Do you? Now? Because – truly – you should walk
out the door if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Catching up.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Terry, meet my ex-husband…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Danny Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Ocean. Forgive me for being late. A
guest required my attention.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Danny was just walking through the restaurant
and spotted me.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I was shocked myself. Imagine the odds.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: ‘Of all the gin joints in all the world…’
You’ve been in prison until recently, isn’t that right? How does it feel
to be out?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: About the same. Everything you want is still
on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: There’s the human condition for you.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Terry, Danny was just about to…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I just wanted to say hello. For old time’s
sake.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Stay for a drink, if you like.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: He can’t –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: – I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Well, then I don’t imagine we’ll be seeing
you again, Mr. Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You never know.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I know everything that happens in my
hotels.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So I should put those towels back.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: The towels you can keep.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good seeing you, Tess.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Take care, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Don’t be.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: House cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Just jumping into the shower, can you come
back later?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: We’re here at the historic Paradiso Hotel
and Casino, once the prize resort of Las Vegas, now seconds away from
demolition…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … and here’s Reuben Tishkoff, former owner
of the Paradiso, come to bid farewell to his fabled resort and wish
Terry Benedict all the best with his future plans for the property…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: Go shit in your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I hope there’s as much dynamite in the
Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday’s fight.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: G’bye, honey…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Saturday day is yours. Do whatever you like
with it.</p>
<p><strong>from above, slowly descending</strong>: Ten of our eleven
surround the model of the three casinos. Rusty leads everyone in a
run-down of the heist…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Call is at five-thirty. Makeup and costume.
Saul’s package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. All
goes well there and we’re a go. Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver
Yen and we’re committed. From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow
the power or he suffocates.</p>
<p><strong>from above, descending still</strong>: This is the Real Deal.
The Bellagio vault. A clock reads: 8:03.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Once the electricity goes, all entry points
to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two
minutes. That’s when we make our move…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Okay: they’ve put you in the middle of the
room, far from everything. You have to get from here to the door without
touching the floor. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fin says he shorts it.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Make it a sawbuck.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: We’re in deep shit.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: The damn demo crew didn’t use a coaxial
lynch to back the mainline! Onioned the mainframe couplet!</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: You understand any of this?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: I’ll explain later.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Blew the backup grid one by one! Like
dominoes!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: understands</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: They did exactly what I planned to do. Only
they did it by accident. Now they know their weakness. And they’re
fixing it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: So unless we decide to do this job in Reno,
we’re screwed.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We could –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: By tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: We could use a pinch.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What – is a pinch?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac
arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry. Or better yet: A pinch
is a bomb… but without the bomb. Every time a nuclear weapon detonates,
it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source
within its vicinity. That tends not to matter in most cases because the
nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. Now
a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the
headache of mass destruction and death. So instead of Hiroshima, you get
the Seventeenth Century.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: About ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Could a pinch take out the power of an entire
city? Like, I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Las Vegas? But there’s only one pinch in the
world big enough to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Pasadena.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You two ready?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Are you a man?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Yes. Nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Are you alive?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Yes. Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Evel Knievel.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Shit! Okay, your turn…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Co-sign squared over .0455.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: No. Co-sign squared over .0415.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: .04-five-five.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: One-five.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You’re so wrong.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: You don’t know your string theory, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Mom told me she loves me more.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: She told me she was going to tell you
that.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Make me.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Make me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We got it. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Where’s Linus?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: One of us should help him.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Then there’ll be two of us who need
saving.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He knows where we are.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What? Would you – shouldn’t someone be behind
the wheel?</p>
<p><strong>127 omitted 127</strong>: &amp; &amp; 128 128</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Alright, back it up, back it up!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: C’mon, c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>yen</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I say stay in the van, you stay in the van,
got it? ’Cause you lose focus for one second in this game, and someone
gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: about enough of</p>
<p><strong>jim lampley</strong>: It’s fight night in Las Vegas…</p>
<p><strong>jim lampley</strong>: … people are flooding in from all over
the country to see what has been dubbed the ‘Fight to End All
Fights’…</p>
<p><strong>jim lampley</strong>: … and even though it’s still five hours
’til the opening bell, the energy here is fever-pitched.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: How we doing?</p>
<p><strong>watcher</strong>: Cotton couldn’t be taller.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Where are they? That’s what I want to
know. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: They’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: ‘They’ll be here.’ Thanks a lot,
Fidel.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Yikes.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You boys have a nice trip?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: We have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: You’ve been red-flagged. It means the
moment you step on the casino floor, they’ll be watching you. Like
hawks. Hawks with video cameras.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Saul: time to get out.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: It’s time when I say it is.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You have any idea how this happened?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I do. He’s been chasing Benedict’s woman. Got
into a real snarl with him two nights ago. I was tailing you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who told you to do that?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I did. I knew you couldn’t leave Tess
alone.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Who’s Tess?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My wife.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Tess is here?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t know if it would sting
you, but it did. You’re out, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: He’s out?!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s that or we shut down right now. His
involvement puts us all at risk.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This isn’t your call.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You made it my call. When you put her ahead
of us. You made it mine.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This is my job.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: But, but… he can’t just be out. Who’s
gonna take his place?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Kid, you up for it?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Find everyone else. Let ’em know the change
in plan. Curtain goes up at seven.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Tess is with Benedict now? She’s too tall for
him.</p>
<p><strong>142 omitted 142</strong>: &amp; &amp; 143 143</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Yes. Yes. No. Very much no. Then inform
Mr. Levin he’ll find a better view of the fight in front of his
television. Surely he must have H.B.O.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Any sign of Ocean?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Not in a couple hours. You want him out? I
can bounce him from the state for parole violation if you like.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Put a guy on him. He’s here for a reason.
I’d like to know what it is. But if he comes anywhere near Tess, take it
to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Bruiser?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Mr. Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Zerga. It’s a very busy night for me.
Are we on schedule?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I have no reason to suspect otherwise. My
couriers should be here momentarily.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: It’s a nice evening. Shall we wait
outside?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: They’re in position.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Okay. We’re a go.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Mr. Zerga. A gift from Mr. Hesse.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Lookin’ like a bad night for the house.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean’s in
the west slots.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I’m afraid I can’t allow my private
security personnel inside the casino cages. I hope you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>racetrack denizen</strong>: Saul? Saul Bloom, is that
you?</p>
<p><strong>racetrack denizen</strong>: Saul, it’s me. Bucky Buchanan,
remember? From Saratoga.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Friedrich, Gunther.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Mr. Benedict… Please: I have never enjoyed the
touch of steel to my skin.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Pops, you won.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Where you gonna put your hands?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Not the pockets, either. And don’t touch your
tie. Look at me…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That how you gonna stand?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Wrong again. I ask you a question, you have
to think of the answer, where you gonna look?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Death. You look down, they know you’re lying
–</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: – and up they know you don’t know the truth.
Don’t use three words when one will do, don’t shift your eyes, look
always at your mark but don’t stare, be specific but not memorable,
funny but don’t make him laugh, he’s gotta like you then forget you the
moment you’ve left his sight, and for God’s sakes whatever you do, don’t
under any circumstances –</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Rust, can you come here a sec?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: They’re very beautiful. A gift.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Can you lift them out, please?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Alright, Mr. Zerga. I acknowledge that the
case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material. I further agree
to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in
our secured vault. While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to
the vault…</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Insurance, for one. Security, another. And
I don’t trust you.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: I put two plainclothes on Ocean. He’s at the
keno bar now.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my casino
manager. If you will allow, he will arrange for your briefcase to be
stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor. Those are
my terms. Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You leave me no choice.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Deep breaths. You’ll do fine.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: No sweat, kid. You’re a rock. Now don’t
fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Room service.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Who ordered the penne?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: This is our security center, where we oversee
all gaming in the casino as well as our vault. You’ll be able to monitor
your briefcase from here.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Don’t let me keep you.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Zerga…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Linus… you’re up.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Deep breaths, deep breaths.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Mr. Benedict…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Sheldon Wills. Nevada Gaming Commission.
Could I have two minutes of your time?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Of course. Anything for the</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Okay: when do you make the deposit?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Not until we get your signal.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey. What do we look like: a couple of
peckerwood jackasses or something?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: to Yen, squeezed into</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Okay. I’m counting down. Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts… now.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: You get no tip.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: It only came to our attention this morning,
Mr. Benedict. Apparently he has a record longer than my arm.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: If he is who you say he is. Charlie. Call
over Ramon Escalante.</p>
<p><strong>pit boss</strong>: Certainly, Mr. Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Did you make it out?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: His head blocked the last two numbers.
We missed it, Linus. You gotta grab the combination yourself.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You new at the commission?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Been there about two years.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I know Hal Lindley over there. You work
with him at all?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Not since he died last year.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Escalante. Would you come with us,
please?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I think it’s better if we talked off the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Tishkoff.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Good evening, Marcel. My nieces and I
would like a table. Something quiet before the fight.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: I can put you at 19 in just a couple
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Quick as you can. The meter’s running
here.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Good evening, Miss Ocean. Right this
way…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Try to keep your tongue in your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: thinks he’s off the</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Hey: you have any idea who I think I
am?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Danny: No.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ll just be a moment.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m having you thrown out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You’re up to something, Danny. What? And don’t
say you came here for me. You’re pulling a job, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tess…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Well, know this: no matter what it is, you
won’t win me back. I can’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I just came to say good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh… then… good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Be good.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Good-bye, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes goon #1</strong>: Mr. Ocean. Mr. Benedict would
like to see you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: are much too big to</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr. Escalante. Or should I call you Mr. Catton?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You are Frank Catton? Formerly of the
Tropicana, the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary
system?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Your silence suggests you don’t refute that.
Mr. Benedict, I’m afraid you’ve been employing an ex-convict. As you
know, the N.G.C. strictly forbids…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Goddamn cracker…</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: believe he just</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You heard me. Just ’cause a black man tries
to earn a decent wage in this state…</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: That has nothing to do with…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: … some cracker cowboy like you’s gotta kick
him out on the street. Want me to jump down, turn around, pick a bale of
cotton, won’t let me deal cards, might as well call it whitejack.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I resent your implication that race has
anything to do with this. Now, as I was saying, the Nevada Gaming
Commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored… … I mean…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay, okay, I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He’s got it. Virgil, Turk: deliver your
package.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Aw, I think… Jesus. I lost my card.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I think… Jesus! I lost my keycard.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Okay. Leave the cart. Go find it.
Take this cart inside.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: There it is now.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: this a bit, nerves</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That’s my cue. Give Basher the go.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Bash, what’s your status?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Bash!</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: No need to yell.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: What’s your status?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: I’m there.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Please show this man off the premises.
Don’t step foot in my casino again.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: over his shoulder,</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Mr. Wills, if you don’t mind…
Mr. Wills?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: My beeper. I’m sorry. I forgot it.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You know how to get back out?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Of course. Enjoy the fight.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How much longer do you think Mr. Benedict
will be?</p>
<p><strong>goon #1</strong>: Just a few minutes more.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No cameras in this room, huh? Don’t want
anyone seeing what happens here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He’s not coming, is he?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who is?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I guess Mr. Benedict didn’t like me talking
to his girl.</p>
<p><strong>goon #1</strong>: We’re gonna step outside now. Leave you two
alone to talk things over.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jesus, Bruiser, not ’til later.</p>
<p><strong>bruiser</strong>: Sorry, Danny. I – I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: S’okay. How’s the wife?</p>
<p><strong>bruiser</strong>: Pregnant again.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then we better get to work.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Yes, I’m very satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Close it up.</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: You alright, sir?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Almost there, kid.</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Going to video now.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Call for a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You didn’t really think I was gonna sit this
one out, did you?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What, didn’t you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I do now.</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen!!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Someone called for a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: How’d you get here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Crawlspace. And I had to give away a couple
mil.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: But what about – I mean, that whole thing
with Rusty…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You think the kid bought it?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Hell, I think Reuben bought it, and he knew
we were screwing around. You sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Bobby Caldwell threw me into the pool first
time. Least I could do is give his kid a push.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Why’d you make me go through all this? Why
not just tell me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, where’s the fun in that? C’mon: Yen’s
got about three minutes of air left.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: You’re too late, guys. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I told you to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who do you like tonight?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tyson or Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: The fight…? Lewis. You like Tyson? How
strongly do you feel about it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You looking for action?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I’d go in for a buck.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A buck it is.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Livingston, we’re set.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Livingston, we’re set.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Basher, we’re set.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Just give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: We don’t have a minute. Yen’s gonna pass
out in thirteen seconds.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Then give me thirteen seconds.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You ever rappelled before?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Never. You?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Then hit it.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: … One…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: … two, three…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: … four, five…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: … six, seven…..</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: … eight, nine…</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Aaaaahhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: … ten…</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: … One, two, three…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: The first goddamn round.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Viva Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, but you’re sweet to ask.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are they in?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: One second. I thought you got kicked
out?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: This tape’s from last night. Same
guards, same…</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: … shift.</p>
<p><strong>uzi-carrying guard #1</strong>: Jesus, Ron, was that you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Not yet. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You think Yen made it out okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m sure he’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s a Chinese man with a hundred sixty
million dollars behind that door. Let’s get him out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fin says he shorts it.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: No bet.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: There’s still the five pins and the
floor sensor. Not much we can do about that from this side of the door.
But from this side…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: … a little bit of Semtex should do the
trick.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Counting down from twenty – – now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: – seventeen, sixteen, fifteen –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: – eleven, ten, nine –</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Linus, can you read me? Linus, do not
blow the door, you’re about to kill Yen.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: – five, four, three –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: – one –</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You check the batteries?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Everything going okay?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: You know, you lose focus for one second in
this game –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: – and someone gets hurt, yeah yeah. I don’t
hear Yen complaining.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Amazing?</p>
<p><strong>yen</strong>: Where the fuck you been?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Ever been in love?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I guess not. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: This is better.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You gonna answer it?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I don’t have a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: It isn’t mine.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: See who’s on the other end.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: May I have a word with Mr. Benedict,
please?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Who the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: The man who’s robbing you.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What the hell is going on down there in
the vault?</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: Nothing, sir. All normal.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: All quiet.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I’m afraid you’re mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’re watching your monitor? Okay, keep
watching.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: In this town, your luck can change just that
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: takes a breath and cups the phone,
then</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Alright. You’ve proved your point. You’ve
broken into my vault. Congratulations: you’re a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: May I ask: how do you expect to leave
here, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Do you believe I’ll simply allow you to
parade bags full of my money out my casino doors?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No. You’re gonna carry it out for us.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: And why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Take a closer look at your monitor…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: As your manager’s probably reporting to you
by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You may notice: we’re only packing up about
half that. The other half we’re leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as
a hostage.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You let our eighty million go, and you get to
keep your eighty. That’s the deal. You try and stop us, we’ll blow both
cash loads.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty million
dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars
publicly. It’s your decision.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Make the call.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: 911. Emergency response…</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Hello, this is Mr. Walsh at the Bellagio.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: We have an incident here…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Okay. You have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Where’s Danny?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He’s fine. He wants you to go upstairs, and
watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: He does?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s alright, Tess. I promise. Good. Here’s
what you do. Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to
deposit six bags in the vault elevator.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: If they meet anyone, we’ll blow the money in
the bags and the money in the vault.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: One minute after that, the elevator will rise
to your cages. Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them
out into the casino.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: If they take more than twenty seconds to
reach the casino floor or if there’s any indication a switch has been
made, we’ll blow the money in the vault and the money in the bags.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: He’s in the casino right now.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Of course, I’m in the casino. In fact, I’m
staying in your hotel. And I have two words for you: mini-bar. Now as
soon as your guards hit the casino floor…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: … a white unmarked van is going to pull up in
your valet station.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Your guards will load the bags into the van’s
rear. If anyone so much as approaches the driver’s door, we blow
everything.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Now, when I get word that the van hasn’t been
followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and
once their safety is confirmed, you’ll get your vault back.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Sir, I have complied with your every
request, would you agree?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I would.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Good. Now I have one of my own.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Run and hide. If you get picked up next
week buying a $100,000 sports car in Newport Beach, I’ll be supremely
disappointed. Because I want my people to find you. And rest assured:
when they do, they won’t hand you over to the police. Run and hide.
That’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Our guys say the van is headed toward
McCarren Airport.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Get everyone in position. I want my vault
back before that van hits the tarmac.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Where’s Zerga? Mr. Zerga? With the
briefcase?</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: He’s – he died.</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: Night goggles on. Prepare to cut
power.</p>
<p><strong>fat</strong>: Ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: Cut it.</p>
<p><strong>swat frequency</strong>: First wave, in! Second wave, now!
Guys, someone’s here! Take him down! Now!</p>
<p><strong>swat frequency</strong>: Lights! We need power now!</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What’s the situation down there?</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: They blew it. They blew the… Oh, Jesus…
If there was anyone in there, they’re not in one piece anymore.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Tell them to take the van. I’m going down
there. Find out how they fiddled with our cameras.</p>
<p><strong>head goon</strong>: Get out of the van, now! Now!</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: Mr. Benedict…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: We couldn’t find any survivors. Or, I’m
afraid, any of your money. I’m sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: anymore; the SWAT</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: Okay, guys, grab your gear and clear
out.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Walsh: How are we with the van?</p>
<p><strong>head goon</strong>: Out of the van now! Hands up!</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Hey, what’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>tishkoff</strong>: Enough monkey business.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Mr. Benedict…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: They took the van.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: And they blew up the bags, sir.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Sir… sir…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What, Walsh?</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: They say it doesn’t look like there was any
money in the bags, sir.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: They say the bags were filled with fliers.
For hookers.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What do you mean there was no money in the
bags?</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: That’s what they said, sir. I don’t
understand it: we both saw them putting money inside those bags.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Walsh, cue up the tape of the robbery.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Does it say ‘Bellagio’ on the south wall
of the vault?</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: No, sir. It doesn’t. I – I don’t
understand…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: We had that installed on Tuesday. The
image we saw of the men robbing us was a tape.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Someone built a double of my vault, then
made a tape of them robbing it. When we saw them putting money in those
bags, that wasn’t actually happening.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Then, sir…</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: … what happened to all the money?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: 9-1-1. Emergency response.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Prepare to cut power!</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Guys, someone’s here!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer Brooks, New
Jersey Probation Division. I have a violator in your jurisdiction… Hit
it.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Ocean…</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Where’s Ocean?</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes goon #1</strong>: Still inside, sir. With
Bruiser.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Open that door.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Wake him up.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Heya, Benedict… How’s the other fight
going?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Did you have a hand in this? Did you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Did I have a hand in what?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Get him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Turn to Channel 88.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You get robbed or something, Benedict? Geez,
that’s a shame.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Stop there.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Where. Is. My. Money.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What would you say if I told you you could
get your money back… … if you gave up Tess? What would you say?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I would say yes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, that’s very interesting… … but I didn’t
have anything to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit. And contact
the police. I would imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation of his parole.</p>
<p><strong>walsh</strong>: Maybe we should have held him.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: No. Follow him. Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Tess… Tess?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You of all people should know, Terry: in your
hotel, there’s always someone watching.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Danny… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I knew what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: How long will you be?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Three to six months, I should think.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Looking for someone?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Thirteen million and you drive that piece of
shit cross country to pick me up?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Hello to you, too.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Your hair’s grayer.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Your eyes got closer together. How’s
life?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Life… is a roomful of pillows. C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Where do you want to go first?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: To a phone.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I stopped and picked up your personal
effects, put them in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not sure these belong to me.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Sure they do.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We need to find Rusty a girl.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: There’s a women’s prison just down the
road…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You said you sold this.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Thief.</p>
