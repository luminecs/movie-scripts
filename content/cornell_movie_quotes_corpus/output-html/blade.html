<h1 id="blade">blade</h1>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: —–</p>
<p><strong>nurse #1</strong>: She’s not breathing!</p>
<p><strong>senior resident</strong>: Intubate her!</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Blood-pressure’s forty and falling –</p>
<p><strong>senior resident</strong>: Jesus, her water’s broken – She’s
going into uterine contractions –</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: So where we going?</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: It’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I likes surprises.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: What do you have down there, little man?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Heat-seeker.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: What the fuck are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Fuck, I need a drink!!!</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: What’s wrong, baby?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Where is Deacon Frost?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Got something in your throat.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain’t saying shit
–</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Frost.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You won’t stop him, Blade. The Tide’s rising,
the Sleeper’s gonna –</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Please don’t –</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Brought you a baked potato, nice and
crispy. Still warm, too.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Jesus, that’s rank –</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: What’s his story?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Paramedics said he was still screaming
when they found him. Looks like some joker had stapled him to a
wall.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Pretty.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You took this off a DOA?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This isn’t human blood.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Then what is it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t know – Look at this blood smear –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The red blood cells are biconvex, which is
theoretically impossible. They’re hypochromic, there’s virtually no
hemoglobin in them. Look at the PMNs, they’re binucleated, they should
be mononucleated.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: What about the chemistry panel?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Blood sugar level is three times the norm,
phosphorous and uric acid are off the scales. Like the woman said,
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Curtis, it’s three in the morning. I’m really
not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: It’s not a joke. I’ve got the stiff sitting
in the morgue right now – look, just come up and see him, okay? Five
minutes, that’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I thought you promised to give me some
distance?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: This is purely professional curiosity,
Karen, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Five minutes, not a second more. And I don’t
want to hear a word about “us”.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You haven’t started in on the internal
organs?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Just the blood sample from the pericardial
sac.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: That’s weird –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: He looks different now, burns are less
extreme, some of these wounds have closed up –</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Tell me something, honestly, you ever have
second thoughts about us?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Sometimes –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: – but then I remember what an ass-hole you
were and I’m snapped back to reality.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Jesus, Karen, you’re breaking my heart here
–</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: – more – blood –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Now don’t we look dapper?</p>
<p><strong>uniform #1</strong>: Hold it, ass-hole!</p>
<p><strong>uniform #1</strong>: I said hold it!!!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My shoulder – dislocated –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Whistler!</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Are we bringing home strays now?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: She’s been bitten.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You should’ve killed her, then.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: She hasn’t turned yet. You can help her.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: No promises. You watch her close. She
starts to turn, you finish her off.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Localized necrosis. She’s borderline.
Another hour and she’d be well into the change.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Can you hear me, woman?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What – ?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You’ve been bitten by a vampire. We’ve got
to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Hold her.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: “Dr. Karen Jansen”. Listen close, I’m
going to inject you with an antidote made from allium setivum – garlic.
This is going to hurt. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: Blade. Once again, our interests have
fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re wrong, Dragonetti.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: The Day Walker represents a unique
opportunity. We’d be fools to waste it by killing him.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our
language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans’
gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Why should I respect something which has
outlived its purpose?</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: I see. And what would you have us do
with this “half-breed”?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA.
He’s the key we’ve been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: He is an abomination!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Why should we spend our lives cringing from
the daylight when his blood offers us an alternative? Enough talk. It’s
time we stepped out of the shadows!</p>
<p><strong>pallintine</strong>: You’re out of line, Frost.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Am I? Or am I just the first to say out loud
what we’ve all been thinking?</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: The shadows suit us, Frost. We’ve
existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our
ways?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Someone who’s sick of living off scraps. The
coming age belongs to us, not the humans! When the final war between our
races comes, who do you want leading the charge?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Some withered up fossil ready to snap like a
brittle bone at the first sign of change?</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: Get out!!!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Careful, old fang. You might wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I had to increase the dose. You’re
building up a resistance to the serum –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Just do it, old man.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m sorry, I –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Who are you people?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: My name is Abraham Whistler. This is
Blade. As for our little homunculus here –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: – he’s a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re joking –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Not at all. You’re looking at a prime
specimen of the homines nocturna.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: If Blade hadn’t brought you here, you
would’ve wound up like him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why did you help me?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Maybe not. I did some checking, she’s a
hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It’s not worth the risk. We can’t trust
her.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Because you’re tainted. The venom’s still
inside you. You could still turn on us.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What happens then?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Then I have to take you out, just like any
other bloodsucker.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We hunt them, moving from one city to the
next, tracking their migrations. They’re hard to kill. They tend to
regenerate.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So what do you use, then? A stake?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Some of the old wives’ tales are true –
they’re severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them
garlic and they’ll go into anaphylactic shock –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: – and of course there’s always sunlight,
ultra-violet rays.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: And you honestly expect me to believe all
this?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I don’t care what you believe. I saved your
life once, I don’t plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice,
you’ll be out of the city by nightfall. If you’re stupid enough to stay,
that’s your business.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I can’t just leave. I have a life here, a
career –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Not anymore. You’ve seen one of them. You
won’t be allowed to live after that.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: There’s a war going on out there. Blade,
myself, a few others – we’ve tried to keep it from spilling over onto
the streets. Sometimes people like yourself get caught in the
cross-fire.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I can go to the police. I have blood samples
back at the hospital. I can show them.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Do it. You’ll be dead before you can file the
complaint.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s ridiculous! No one’s that
powerful.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You’re talking about a brotherhood that
predates the Catholic Church by thousands of years. Their survival
depends on their ability to blend in. Chances are, you’ve encountered
them and not even known it. On the subway, in a bar –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Get in. You�re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace –
silver nitrate, essence of garlic.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So that’s it? You guys just patch me up and
send me on my way?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: There is one other thing. I’d buy yourself
a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if
you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you’ve had to drink – then
I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than
the alternative.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: These archives are restricted to members
of the House of Erebus.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Please. You and the other Elders wouldn’t
know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it. Which, of
course, they do.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: You’re wasting your time, Frost. Far
greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever
secrets they hold have been lost.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: What are you up to, Frost?</p>
<p><strong>frost’s voice</strong>: Wouldn’t you like to know, Old
Fang?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Remember what we said. Keep your eyes open.
They’re everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I need the police. This is an emergency –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was with
Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital last night – that’s right, I witnessed
the attack – 115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I’ll wait here. Please
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Get a grip on yourself, girl.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Sergeant Gideon. I’m responding to a 911
call.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes, that was me, I’m Karen Jansen –</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Are you all right? I’m glad you called,
Ms. Jansen, we’ve been anxious to get a hold of you. You disappeared on
us for a while.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I know. Listen – do you have any idea what
happened to Curtis, the other doctor?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Oh, he’s dead. But I wouldn’t worry about
that if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Because you’re dead too.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Garlic?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He said it would work against vampires –</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Who said I was a vampire?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Thanks for the laugh. You can shut your eyes
if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Figured they’d send someone after you.
Thought I’d wait around and see who showed up.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You used me as bait?!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It worked, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But, he could’ve –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He didn’t. Get over it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But he’s a policeman –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He’s a familiar. A human who works for the
vampires. See this mark?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: That’s a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle
brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone’s property. Any of
the other vampire’s try to bleed him, they’ll have to answer to
Friendly’s owner – This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We’ve been
tracking him for a while now –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why in God’s name would anyone want to work
for them?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Because they’re vampire wanna-bes. If they’re
loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: And that’s a good thing?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: For some. Live forever, never get old. The
ultimate high.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How ’bout you, Officer? You a good little
bloodhound?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Looks like our friend was blood-running.
Where were you headed?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Mphuck you –</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Jesus – 1227 Brookner – Holliston Clinic
–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Preventive medicine.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You can’t do this, he’s human, it’s
murder.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It’s war, now get the fuck out of the
way!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea what you
just did?! He’ll warn them. They’ll be waiting!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You were going to kill him. What was I
supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and pretend I didn’t see what I saw?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Let me set you straight on something, Doctor.
What you’ve “seen” so far is nothing. The world you live in’s just the
sugar-coated topping. There’s another world beneath it, the real world –
and it’s a fucking bloodbath. If you want to survive in it, you’d better
pull your head out of your ass.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Look, I know you’re disappointed –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Crestfallen.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Blade was waiting for me. There wasn’t
anything I could do.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Tell me something, Gideon, what blood type
are you?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: I don’t really know –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Take a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps? I’m
interested in the antigens here, the agglutination reaction –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I’m going to guess AB positive.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: AB positive. Give the man a prize.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What the hell are you doing?! I could have
killed you!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I remembered the address. I followed you
–</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Do you have a death wish or are you just
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Look, if what you say is true, if there’s a
chance I could turn into one of them, then I’ve got no choice, do I? I
have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It’s
the only way I’ll be able to find a cure for myself.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: There is no cure.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What do you see here?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Graffiti –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Look closer.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: This isn’t a gang tag, it’s a vampire
marking. It means there’s a safe-house nearby. A place they can go if
dawn is coming.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I know this place – it’s a blood bank.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Owned by vampires. There’s one of these in
every major city, and just like Domino’s, they always deliver. You
telling me you’re ready to walk through that door?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: All right, then, listen up, Vampire Anatomy
101. Crosses and running water don’t do dick, so forget what you’ve seen
in the movies.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You use the stake, silver, or sunlight, got
it?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Know how to use one of these?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Safety’s off, round’s already chambered –
Silver hollow-points filled with garlic. You aim for the heart or the
head, anything else is a one-way ticket to a pine box.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Get out. Now.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I know you’re blood-running. Who’s your
sponsor?</p>
<p><strong>tanaka</strong>: I don’t know what you’re –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What if you’ve made a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What’s this? A birthmark?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Still think we might be wrong? How much are
you shipping?</p>
<p><strong>tanaka</strong>: Bite me!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’ve got a message for your masters – the
night’s no longer safe for their kind.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You let him go – An hour ago you were ready
to kill a man for less, this one didn’t even talk.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He will.</p>
<p><strong>automated voice</strong>: “You’ve reached a number that is no
longer in service. Please consult your operator and try again”.</p>
<p><strong>tanaka’s voice</strong>: It’s Tanaka, PIN number
sixteen-zero-zero-nine –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>tanaka</strong>: Get me Pearl!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Pearl is feeding –</p>
<p><strong>tanaka</strong>: Look, I’m not fucking around here! That
hunter Frost has been talking about? He was just at the clinic. Tore the
goddamn place apart!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is
crawling with them. See the valets over there? They’re vampires. So is
the doorman.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: The way they move, they way they smell –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: The whore on the corner, she’s one too. So
are the two men standing under the streetlight.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So many of them – I still can’t believe
they’re real.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: There are worse things than vampires out
there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Like me.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: I’m sorry, sir – do you have an
invitation?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Where’s the entrance?!</p>
<p><strong>tanaka</strong>: I can’t – they’ll kill me!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I got news for you, butt-boy. You’re already
dead.</p>
<p><strong>tanaka</strong>: Oh God, shit – behind the bookcase –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: After you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Some kind of archive –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Isn’t this all a little high-tech? I thought
vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’ve been watching too much TV. They’ve got
their claws sunk into everything – finance, real estate, politics.
Probably own half of Downtown.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: This must be where they keep their records
–</p>
<p><strong>pearl’s voice</strong>: Lorca, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>frost’s voice</strong>: Congratulations, Day-Walker.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Frost?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: In the flesh, Blade. I understand you’ve been
looking for me. I’m flattered.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Don’t be. You’re another notch on my sword
hilt, nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re quick, Blade, I’ll give you that. In
the space of an hour you’ve crossed my familiar, destroyed a blood bank
– Now here you are in the heart of our archives, terrorizing our
curator.</p>
<p><strong>pearl’s voice</strong>: He has a knife to my throat, Frost!
He –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re history, Pearl. Have the good grace to
die with some dignity. Round one to you, Blade.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: A sun lamp. We’re gonna play twenty
questions. Depending on your answers, you might get to have yourself a
tanning session.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What were you in such a big hurry to delete
just now?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: It’s an epistle, a letter Frost has been
translating – it prophesizes LaMagra’s return.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: And who is LaMagra?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: LaMagra is The Sleeper!!!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Where’s the original, Pearl? You must have it
around here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: The vault –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: If he moves, cook him.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Please, I’ll give you the combination –
you’ll damage the documents –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: That’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He moved.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Hola, amigo. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You took my arm, Blade. But that’s okay, I’m
growing a new one –</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Nice, huh? Think I’ll ever play the piano
again? You can slice him, you can dice him, and the man just keeps on
coming.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Stay with me, sweetness, I’m not through with
you yet.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Teak. Nice craftsmanship. Now here’s a man
who takes his job just a little too seriously, don’t you think? Which
reminds me, Blade, think I owe you one –</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Actually, if you want to get technical, I owe
you two.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: What’s so funny, bright eyes?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’m expecting some company.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Christ, I’m too old for this. Somebody get
me a goddamn wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How did you find us?!</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: We keep in radio contact.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’ve been listening in the whole time?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You think I’d let him run loose without a
chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow
them all to kingdom come.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: There’s a subway line due East of here.
We’d best make tracks.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Whistler!</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Go on, I’ll be fine!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He can take care of himself! GO!!!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re hurt –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Nothing that won’t heal by dawn.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I need help with this –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What am I injecting you with?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Serum – it’s a human hemoglobin
substitute.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re one of them, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Not quite. I’m a hybrid. Half-human,
half-vampire.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Don’t even start, old man.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me the truth about
him?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: We weren’t sure we could trust you.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Blade’s mother was attacked by a vampire
while she was pregnant. Ultimately, she died, but her unborn child
lived. Unfortunately, he’d undergone certain genetic changes while in
the womb –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I found Blade when he was thirteen. He’d
been living on the streets, feeding off the homeless. Apparently the
Thirst manifested itself at puberty – I took him for one of them at
first, almost killed him, too. But then I realized what he was.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: He took my fucking hand! Again!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You seem to be in the habit of losing them
fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the amputee lifestyle just suits you.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: We need to find him, tonight.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Down, boy. Blade’s not going anywhere. I
promise. Right now, though, we’ve more pressing business – It’s time
Dragonetti paid the piper.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Blade’s unique, you know. A one in a
billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he
still has the Thirst.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What happens if he doesn’t take the
serum?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: The Thirst overcomes him, just like the
others. It’s not something he can control. The problem is, time’s
running out. His body’s starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my
efforts to find a cure have ended in failure –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No offense, Whistler, but you’re not exactly
working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed
something.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Which is why you’re here. We could use
someone with your experience.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: This used to be mine, you know. It’s been
passed down through the centuries, from one hunter to the next –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why do you hunt them?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Habit, mostly, just like this.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I had a family once – a wife, three
daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening
–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He killed them?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Eventually. He toyed with them first. He
made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How did you escape?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I didn’t. He was cruel enough to let me
live. Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: And now you’re using Blade to exact your
revenge?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Frost’s bodycount keeps rising, and I’m
not getting any younger, am I?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I wouldn’t go in there if I were you. It’s
best to leave him alone when he’s like this.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Blade?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s dark in here.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You get used to the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Whistler told me about your mother.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I can’t close my eyes without hearing her
scream.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Those aren’t real memories. No one has that
kind of recall.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I do. I remember from day one. People staring
at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes,
knowing in their hearts I wasn’t human.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If you’re not human, then why do you bleed
like us? I’ve seen vampire blood, you don’t have it running through your
veins.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Just get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Blade –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I said, GET OUT!!!</p>
<p><strong>frost’s voice</strong>: Rise and shine, little wing.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: What is this? Where am I?!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: When was the last time you stopped to
appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? Three, four hundred years?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: How do you like that? Right on time.</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: The other elders will never let you get
away with this!</p>
<p><strong>dragonetti</strong>: Don’t you see, you fools?! He’ll betray
you too! He’s planning on invoking LaMagra himself!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you just got
a little too long in the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Dragonetti was right. You were fools to trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: China Town. I need more serum. What’s all
this?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I made a trip to the hospital last night,
borrowed some equipment.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: For your miracle cure?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: She’s been making real progress, Blade.
Show him –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This is sodium citrate. It’s an
anti-coagulant. We use it to treat blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood
is thinner than humans, though. Watch what happens when I introduce some
into a sample –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Can you imagine what a dash of that would
do on your sword?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Before you go, I’d like to take a sample of
your blood.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is he sick?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Cancer.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You care about him, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We’ve got a good arrangement, that’s all.
Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die – end of
story.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My mother used to say that a cold heart is a
dead heart.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting
card.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’d wish you luck, Doc, but I never put much
stock in optimism.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How’s it going, Kam?</p>
<p><strong>kam</strong>: You’re a week early.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I was in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Whistler says I’m building up a resistance to
it.</p>
<p><strong>kam</strong>: I was afraid that might happen.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Maybe it’s time to start exploring other
alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>kam</strong>: There’s only one alternative to the serum.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Yeah. I know.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Thanks, Kam. One other thing. Have you ever
heard of a vampire called the Sleeper?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I found this in there archives. I need to
find someone who can read their language.</p>
<p><strong>kam</strong>: I’ve heard about a woman named Miracia. Some
say she’s a mayombero, a Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives in that
tent community down by the city dump. I’m told she only sees people at
night.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Afternoon, Blade.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Easy.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Wouldn’t want our little friend here to wind
up on the back of a milk carton, would we?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Beautiful day, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How can you be out here?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical
research. We’ve developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate,
a few others things.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: It’s not very effective in direct sunlight,
but it’s a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, “the
Day-walker”.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I don’t buy it.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Why not? The future of our race runs through
your bloodstream. You’ve got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our
strengths and none of our weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Maybe I don’t see it that way.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Oh, so it’s back to pretending we’re human
again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can’t keep denying
what you are. You’re one of us, Blade. You always have been.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a
half-breed like you? They can’t. They’re afraid of you. The humans fear
us because we’re superior. They fear us because in their hearts they
know their race has become obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Look at them, just an endless stream of
cattle in a mad race to the slaughterhouse.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: The pause that refreshes – Care for some?
Smells good, doesn’t it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of
iron.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Pass.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You
won’t find a drink that’s sweeter.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Tell me honestly, do you really get the same
rush from that pasteurized piss-serum of yours? You’re surprised I know
about your serum? You shouldn’t be. I know everything about you.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You can’t keep walking the razor’s edge,
Blade. The day will come – and soon, when you’ll have to choose between
our kind and their’s. If I were you, I’d take care not to wind up on the
wrong end of the fang.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Love to continue this chat, but it appears
I’m melting.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>mercury</strong>: This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I’ve found
their hiding place.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Any progress?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Some. It’s been slow –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You don’t look so good.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m just tired, that’s all. We’ve been up all
night.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It’s started.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’ve got another day or two at most.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: For what it’s worth, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You make it sound like I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Extranjero. �Quien es?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’m here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: All right, let’s start with the basics – why
do vampires need to drink blood?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Their own blood can’t sustain
hemoglobin.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like
Hemolytic anemia?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So what about gene therapy?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Basically you’d have to re-write the victim’s
DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of
generating hemoglobin.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: With a retrovirus. It’s injected into the
bone marrow cells, it causes the host’s DNA to mutate. They’ve been
using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You’re serious? You actually think this
could work?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: On me, yes. On Blade, I’m not so sure – The
problem is, Blade didn’t contract the vampire virus from a bite like I
did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every
vampire but him.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Then we’re back to square one, aren’t we?
Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What happened to the power?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I don’t know, but the back-up generator
should’ve kicked in.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: UV floodlights are down too.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Get it!!!</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Understand this – they are monsters.
Hesitate for even a moment, and you’ve lost.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Words to live by, Whistler.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: It’s been a long time, hasn’t it, “old
friend”?</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: Is something wrong, my friend?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’re blind –</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: There are other ways to see. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: Perhaps you have brought me something – an
offering for the orishas?</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: Hold out your hands.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I didn’t come here to get my palms read. I
need something translated.</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: Sangre. Written in blood.</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: This is an old tongue, from an old world.
It concerns LaMagra.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Who is LaMagra?</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: The vampire God. This speaks of His
return.</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: “– there will come a Day Walker.” “His
blood will call the Sleeper from beyond the Veil of Tears.”</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: His blood – ?</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: The Day Walker’s blood is a disparador – a
trigger, you see? For LaMagra’s return. One need only consume it and the
spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him. “And the Sleeper will rise
from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood.”</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: “The Blood Tide”.</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said
that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How do I stop it?</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The Dark
is rising. How would you fight a shadow?</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: I am tired. Dawn is coming.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: But I just got here –</p>
<p><strong>miracia</strong>: You’ve been here longer than you think.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to you?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Frost took her –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Don’t try to talk –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Listen. You have to – finish me off. You
don’t want me coming back.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: No, we can treat the wounds –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Too far gone, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Whistler, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Yes you can. Now get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Whistler, I –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I know. Just be quick about it, will you?
Do it right.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Hello, Blade. By the time you watch this,
Whistler will no doubt be winging his way to Heaven, thanks to your
capable hands. If it makes any difference to you, he put up quite a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Now, I’m sure you’re wondering about
Ms. Jansen’s well-being. She’s alive and kicking – “ambulatory”, as they
like to say in the trade. Whether or not she remains so is entirely up
to you. I’ll make this as easy as possible for you, Blade. You can find
us at the Edgewood Towers. We’ll be waiting with baited breath.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Well, here we are, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why haven’t you killed me yet?</p>
<p><strong>mercury</strong>: Deacon likes to play with his food before
he eats it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How many of you are there?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: A few thousand scattered about the globe. In
the past, we’ve had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That
won’t be necessary after tonight.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What happens then?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war
against the humans. There’s a force, you see – a spirit that exists in
our blood. I’ve discovered a way to invoke it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: LaMagra –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: That’s right. The answers were there all
along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind.
Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were
foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.
Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set
that force free.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: LaMagra isn’t a physical being. He’s a
spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest
himself.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There’s no need for any of this. Your
condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when
–</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: What makes you think we want to be cured?
Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that’s what
the Thirst is really about.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But you use blood banks –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is
inferior. There’s no flavor left to it, no life. Fortunately, I’ve found
a way around that particular obstacle.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Under these conditions I can keep a donor
alive for years, producing anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of
blood. Of course, this is just a pilot program, really. Once the Tide
comes, we’ll need to expand production. So many more mouths to feed
–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re a monster.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Why? Because we live at another species’
expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don’t they? Fattening them up
with steroids? It’s called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the
fittest.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I have a wake-up call for the human race.
You’re no longer at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p><strong>vampire</strong>: You think I’m afraid of that toothpick of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You should be. I’ve made some
improvements.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Jason.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Mother – ?!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’ve missed you so much, Jason. You have no
idea what I’ve been through, how much I’ve wanted to see you –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: But you – died –</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Deacon brought me back.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Fight him –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: She can’t. She’s one of my thralls now. She
has about as much free will as a puppet on a string. You love me, don’t
you, Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: What do we have here? Your precious serum? I
don’t think you’ll be needing this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Please –</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Listen to your father, Jason. It’s going to
be a better world.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Don’t look so surprised, Blade. You’ve spent
your life looking for the vampire who fathered you. Well you can rest
easy now, you’ve found him. Daddy’s here.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: It’s true, Blade. You’ve got my blood running
through your veins. Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a woman on her
way home alone. You were conceived the night I tore my fangs into your
mother’s flesh.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’ve been better –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How long have we been driving?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t know. I woke up just before you did
–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is it bad?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We get out of this alive, maybe I’ll take
that miracle cure of yours.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It won’t work on you.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Your condition’s congenital, the genetic
mutations occurred in utero. All the other victims contracted vampirism
after birth.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I can’t cure you, Blade. I can cure myself,
but I can’t cure you. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Welcome home, children.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: On its surface, this building houses one of
the city’s oldest financial institutions – and for over two-hundred
years its served our corporate needs. Look beneath the surface, however,
and you’ll discover another truth entirely –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: As above, so below.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Welcome to our hall of ancients, Doctor. We
call it the Temple of Night.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Let’s see this sword of his.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Still quite sharp, I see.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Blade –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re wasting your breath, woman. He can’t
hear you now. It’s the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its
grip.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: How long has it been since you had your
serum? Twelve hours? More? You must be quite thirsty by now.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: What does it feel like? Is your blood on
fire? Are you burning up inside? Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace
your true nature.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: – go to hell –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I’ve got news for you, Blade. We’re already
here.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Take him to the sanctuary. It’s time he was
bled.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I’d let you watch the proceedings, Doctor,
but I’m afraid that privilege is reserved for members of my own race.
Don’t worry, though, I’ve made alternate arrangements for you.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: We call this the Bone Pit. It’s where we keep
our mistakes, the ones who couldn’t successfully make the transition
from human to vampire.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: They’ll feed on anything, given the chance –
animals, corpses, even other vampires.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Of course, a strapping young woman like
yourself – well I think you just might be considered finger food.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: It’s been a long road, hasn’t it? Such a pity
Whistler led you so far astray.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I don’t blame you, though. I want you to know
that. Even after all you’ve done. I understand, Blade, I really do. It’s
the human side of you which has corrupted your reasoning, made you weak.
But we’ll take care of that, won’t we?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’d kill myself – before I turned into
something like you.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: No you wouldn’t. I’m going to bleed you dry,
Blade. All the poison that makes you human. When the Tide comes, you’ll
be begging me put you through the Change.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: It’s done. We should ready ourselves for the
ritual of invocation.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: There’s no use fighting us, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How could you be a part of this?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: These are my people now. I’m one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You don’t have to be.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You don’t understand. I’ve killed, I’ve
hunted, and I’ve enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I wish you could see the world as I do.
Deacon opened my eyes. There’s no turning back from that.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I don’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or
later, the Thirst always wins.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Your mother died the night you were
born.</p>
<p><strong>revenant</strong>: Karennnnn –</p>
<p><strong>revenant</strong>: Karreennnnnn. I never thought I’d see you
againnnnn.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Curtis?!</p>
<p><strong>curtis revenant</strong>: Tell, me, Karennn – ever have
second thoughts – about us?</p>
<p><strong>mercury</strong>: It won’t be long now, lover.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: We should finish him off.</p>
<p><strong>mercury</strong>: No. Deacon wants him turned.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Fucking waste, if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Tonight is the night we’ve waited our entire
lives for. Tonight, the blood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the world.
Tonight, the Age of Man comes to an end.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Blade.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: “And what rough beast, its hour come round at
last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Get out of here –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m not leaving without you.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You don’t understand. The Thirst –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: – tearing me – apart.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I know. Take some of my blood.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s the only way. You know that. We’ll never
get out of here alive if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I can’t – I won’t be able to stop –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes you will. The human side of you is
stronger. I know it is.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Don’t stop –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My God –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Are you – all right?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Never been better.</p>
<p><strong>mercury</strong>: Deacon?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: No longer.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Frost!!!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Who dies first?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Take him.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Grew another hand for you sweetmeat – – and
now I’m gonna kill you with it.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Let’s see if you can grow a new one of
these!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Next?</p>
<p><strong>mercury</strong>: Have a taste of your own medicine!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Enough!!!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re too late, Blade. I’m already changing.
Don’t you see? The Sleeper has awakened. I’m not just Frost anymore. I’m
becoming a god now, blood incarnate.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Did you think I’d forgotten you, you little
whore?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You can’t hurt me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You want my blood so much?! Take it!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never
one of us. You’re a traitor to your race.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Get away from him!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Blade!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Guess you’re not quite as invulnerable as you
thought.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re wrong – a few minutes more, and my
transition will be complete. Even your sword won’t be able to affect me
then.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You don’t have a few minutes, Frost.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Just as I thought. Still chained to your
mother’s breast after all these years.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re too human, Blade.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It’s because I’m human that I can do
this.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Blade?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I never imagined I’d be so happy to see the
sun rise – It’s over, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: For them. But for me –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I feel like it’s finally beginning.</p>
