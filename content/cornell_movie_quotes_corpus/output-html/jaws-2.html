<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that eloquent
solo. Now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate
this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the
recreational paradise we call Amity.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Where the hell were you?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Late.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I can see that. Don’t you know this is a big
deal?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Couldn’t help it. Hendricks over there…
…still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and I couldn’t find the
spares.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Terrific. Act as if you’ve been here all
along.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: How’m I supposed to do that?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Look bored.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Holiday Inn joins the Amity Shores
development condominium complex in a welcome expression renewed interest
in Amity Island as the hub of the Northeast Recreational Vacation
Wonderland. We’re happy once again to be in the center of things, where
the action is… We’ve had our share of hard times and long winters and
the past few years have not been easy. But today, the sun is rising on a
new Amity, a new island filled with promise. Len Peterson’s Amity Shores
Development is an exciting addition to our island. The Holiday Inn we
stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family. Amity means
‘friendship’ and our community extends its friendship to all who seek
her shores in peace and harmony.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: …And now, Tina Wilcox, this year’s Miss
Amity, will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new
hotel…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Tina was selected from more than 20 of this
island’s lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition held every
spring, and she’ll represent Amity Island in the Miss Massachusetts
Competition in Worcester next month. When she cuts this ribbon, she will
be opening our island to growth, to development, to planned expansion
with full employment for our thriving community.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I don’t think she’s such hot stuff.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: When are we going out? You and me?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: You going with Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Listen, Jane – you want to dance as soon as we
get out of these monkey suits?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Mom, Michael won’t talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Shouldn’t he be at home?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mrs. Silvera couldn’t come.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: This money tree, you may have noticed, is
made entirely of twenty-dollar bills, donated by Len Peterson, the
builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, as a gesture of goodwill towards
the community. $500 as a special gift to the Amity township scholarship
fund…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Go ahead, Tina.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua-
Sports, for contributing the special decorations. And now, the Amity
High School band. Refreshments on the patio, everyone…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Do I have to talk to those two?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My boss and your boss. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: The speech was right on the money. Be a
love and make sure the bar’s open, will you?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Fantastic lady. Don’t know what I’d do
without her.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Y’know, Brody – for the first time in
years it’s worth putting money into this town.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: All of us thank you, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Watch Sean for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Can I go swimming?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No. Find your brother, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How old is your cousin?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Seventeen. She’s a senior.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m not crazy about blind dates.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: They’re okay, if they got little white canes
and tin cups.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: That’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What the hell. Did your mom put all this
together?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah, it’s her job.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Is she responsible for the punch?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Good. It’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: My cousin will be here tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Michael, Michael, Dad said to find you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay, you did that.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Come on, Mikey, come on…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Okay, okay. Got to go.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Want to dance? Okay. Later?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Get a dance yet?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Who’d you ask?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tina Wilcox.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: You’re crazy. She’s Ed’s girl friend.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Doesn’t hurt to ask. Sometimes the most
beautiful girls are the loneliest.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: That’s a crock of shit.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The mayor?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Larry Vaughn Junior? If you see him, tell him I
got a six- pack, a blanket, and the Brebner twins.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: No class.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: None at all. I wonder what the Brebner twins
are doing tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Can you take a little time out from your busy
schedule to dance with the old man?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Because they’re playing our song.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: May I have this dance?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Sorry, I’m all booked up… Come, m’dear.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: And how. I thought you wouldn’t respect
me.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I did, I did.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Listen – what are you doing later?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Fooling around?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Let’s get the kid home.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Home it is.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You’re getting a little big for this.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: MMMmmmorning…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Sean’s awake.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Door’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sean’s voice</strong>: The milk fell out of the
’frigerator.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Put a towel down. And shh – daddy’s
sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>sean’s voice</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: C’mere…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Mrs. Silvera?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mrs. Silvera.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: As far as the office.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Some people.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What’s daddy doing?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Writing a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hey! That’s my boss!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Better yet.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Too late, it’s written.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don’t
you have any pull with the chief, here?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Better get a sales kit together for after
lunch. I’m taking some prospects out.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Can’t we fix it up to get this made into a
green zone or something?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Len, pay the two dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Tie it off on your left. Your other
left!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: dock, Sean tagging</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi,
Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I’m not short. I’m eleven.</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: Yo! Chief!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: You got a gold-plater drifting in the main
channel. Big cruiser.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Whereabouts?</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: Off the Point. No running lights, just a
diver’s flag.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Want me to run out there?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: On your own time?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Happy to do it.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Then check it out. I’ll be in the office.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Cast off your bow line. And your stern
line. Spring line…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No place special. Just hanging out.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Sailing?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Watch your kid brother, huh?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Bye, Mr. Brody.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Anyone want to sail to the lighthouse?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Machs nix to me.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Anyone got a spare mooring line? Mine’s
shot.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I’ve got one…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Can I go too?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I said, ‘No.’</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: You’re not going out right away, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Waiting for Andy.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I want you to meet my cousin.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I will, I will.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I want to go out with you. You need a crew,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t need you. Andy’s here.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You always go with Andy.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How was dive class?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Same as always – glub-glub, bubble- bubble,
stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the
ocean.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Shells and lobsters and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mostly old garbage. Today we found a ’48
Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Do I have to play with the little kids?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah. Go on, beat it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Brooke! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Who’s that? Quick – I’m in love.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I hope that’s the cousin.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Over here. I want you to meet somebody.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: How fast does this go?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: With the right wind, 15-20 knots.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Real fast.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Far out!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Coming up!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Gangway, Turkies!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’re carrying weight.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We’ll take your supercargo.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Is that me?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: That’s you.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’ve never been supercargo.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hey, get out of our air!</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Want a passenger?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Way to go!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Rich or poor, it’s nice to have
money.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Figure they split?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Happens every season – someone takes off.
Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox
hunting.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: This is all there is.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: If that’s it, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>indignant man</strong>: I can’t watch the news, I can’t watch
a ball game, I can’t watch movies – all I hear is that rotten kid with
his rotten radio… “Breaker, Breaker…”</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’ll do what I can, but you’re talking about
a federal jurisdiction…</p>
<p><strong>indignant man</strong>: So call the FBI!</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Black, two sugars.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Thanks. What else is out there?</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: One petty theft, one domestic disturbance,
and an exhibitionist.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’ll take the exhibitionist, you handle the
others.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Chief Brody? I want you to do something about
my first husband.</p>
<p><strong>white-haired man</strong>: Martin, you have got to demand
that Grace Kinney keep her shades down.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: What about enforcing the “No Parking”
ordinance on Beach Road?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: In a minute, in a minute – talk to
Mrs. Prendergast, please…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Albert keeps coming around when I’m with
gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars…</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Every time there’s an out- of-state car in
my driveway, I lose another mailbox. Those little iron sailboats cost
thirty-two dollars each!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney.</p>
<p><strong>white-haired man</strong>: Her bedroom window faces my oldest
boy’s bedroom, and she’s teasing him, dancing around in a towel, or
less…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Dancing?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Chief…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and
your Form 908.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I never heard of a 908.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I just made it up. It means, “Get me out of
there.” What the hell’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Diver’s camera. Tom Andrews brought it up
from under that abandoned cruiser.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Abandoned? It’s a little early in the season
for that.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode
Island.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell
wouldn’t leave it anchored alone in the channel.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: If you had a $100,000 boat there’d be an
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>white-haired man</strong>: Grace Kinney is driving my boy to
distraction.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Hendricks, get a description of that
dance.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Chief Brody? I want to talk to you about
my daughter… she’s 15, but mature for her age…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Chief, I’ve been telling Mrs. Prendergast
that it’s no good just talking about Albert, she’s got to do
something…</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Look – the township is responsible for
protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Did you ever see a dolphin?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Sure. They like to play. We may see some
today.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Whoops, almost lost one. Can’t play with the
dolphins without skis…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hang on, hang on… Okay, go.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Take a break for a minute, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We
can use my Uncle’s boat. Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Next week.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: With you, everything’s next week. I want to go
skiing soon. Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Faster! Faster!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Terry! You okay?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Okay, okay, coming…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Terry!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Help! God, help!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No-o-o-o-o-o…!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I can’t find anyone out here. They
must’ve gone to the bottom, or drifted with the current.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: There should be bodies. Witnesses say two
people; one in the boat, one skiing.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I told you – nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Try dragging.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: For how long? Current’s moving everything
around, and it’s getting dark.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Stay on it. I don’t care how long it
takes.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: 10-4.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: We heard this noise, like a ‘boomp’ out there,
and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That was the explosion. One minute they were
having a wonderful time, the next, bang!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t know what could’ve done that.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Can we go now?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Chief Brody – can we go? Please?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Oh, yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Until we find something.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t care about the overtime, I’m hungry.
And cold. And most of all, bored.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I think we got something.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: About damn time.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: What the hell is it?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Here it comes…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Oh shit. Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Power line.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It comes here from Cable Junction.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Untangle it and let’s go – We don’t need
a blackout on the island.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Now you’re talking. Let’s get out of here
before we do find something.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You have to smoke so early in the
morning?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s good with coffee.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: So’s a donut.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I want Fruit Loops!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Eat Cheerios.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Eat Cheerios.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What’re you guys doing today?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know about him – I’m going down to the
dock, maybe go sailing.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Every day?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What else is there to do?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You could work out at the beach, make a few
bucks for school.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You’ll have to make up your own mind about
that.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Where’s my day book?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: In the den.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: He doesn’t have to work all the time, it’s
his vacation.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. silvera</strong>: Good morning – everyone up early
today?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: There’s a lot going on.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Why don’t you take a half day and clean this
junk up?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Because, I’m in the middle of a boating
accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief
Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat. He’s another
one.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: One what? Ah-ha!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Boat nut. What is it about this place that
makes everyone a freak for boating?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s an island. Got to run.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up old
cars? Bartending?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Bartending? I’m 17.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every
day?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Because.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Look, humor the old man – just be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll be careful. I’ll see y’later.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Don’t go out if it’s rough or anything, huh?
We’ve had a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Can I go with you today?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. silvera</strong>: You can come with me to the
market.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’ll be at the office.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Bye, Daddy. I’m going to be careful, all
day.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Where’re we going?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: The lighthouse?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No big thing, we’ll see who’s out there, maybe
picnic.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We got some stuff at the store. Ed and Tina
are going to be there.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Oh, sure, they would be.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What’s the lighthouse?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s an island, near here, with a lighthouse.
We sometimes hang out there, you know…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Great. I got some wine.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: The lighthouse is a make-out spot.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Now I really want to see it.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: You going to fool around with Mike? Well,
I’m not doing anything with him.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Well, maybe I will, then.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Come on back up here!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Give me back my hat!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Double nope!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Why’d they decide to move?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Too hot in the lighthouse?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Too hot for those two? I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Is there something I don’t know about?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: I told you, remember?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Oh, yeah. So why aren’t they doing it
now?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Maybe by now they are.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They’re moving pretty fast.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: He’s cute…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yech!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: As soon as I heard about it, I called you.
This thing is big!</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: After we’ve looked, we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Move back, please… back off… open it up a
little…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: See? What’d I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Look at that!</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: First things first.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: From the tip of the snout, please.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Come on, let’s check the bite radius.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Bite radius. You know, the size of the
mouth?</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: The whale’s mouth?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: The Shark’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: What shark?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: The shark that did this. It was a shark,
wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: We don’t know that, do we?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: But that’s what we’re here to find out,
right?</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: You don’t tell me my job, and I won’t tell
you about yours, okay?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I can’t hear you if you’re going to
whisper.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Can we go now?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You stay here a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: We’ll be over by the lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll be right there. Wait up.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Could be a shark. But maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Look, I know a little bit about sharks.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I know that this was probably a Great White
Shark. Car-cadon… Caradan…</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Carcharadon Carcharias.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Okay, so that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Is there one in these waters?</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: What makes you think there might be?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Because this big fish has been bitten by some
other big fish…</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: This is a mammal, not a fish.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Jesus, don’t quibble with me. I want to know
if a Great White Shark did this.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That’s it? Probably? Look, sharks are
attracted by blood, and thrashing around…</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: And sound.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Sound?</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on
irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency
vibration.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: So there’s one around here.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Not necessarily. These wounds could’ve been
inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately
fatal. Currents could’ve carried the body 10 miles further.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: We got a helluva tide this month.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Could you just keep that crowd back,
please?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Pop…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You stay right here. You’re going in with
me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We came out in my boat.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Andy can sail in it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I got a date!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: She’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: She won’t.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by
predator attempt to seize the tongue. Additional large tissue loss in
the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. Oriamal bite
radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small
predator and scavenger tissue attacks…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I don’t want to discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: It’s either a Great White, or another killer
whale.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Can’t you tell?</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Not when it’s like this. This animal has
been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every
little nibbler in the sea’s taken a bite.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Look – can Great White Sharks communicate?
Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an
enemy…</p>
<p><strong>elkins</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous – Sharks don’t take
things personally.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Dad, please…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No more sailing. You come back with me, and
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Because I say so.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ll tie up at the town dock, don’t worry,
man.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: See you later, Mikey…</p>
<p><strong>ed and tina</strong>: Later, bye…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I’m showing summer rentals. We got a helluva
season going.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: We have got to talk, and we have got to talk
alone.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: We’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Larry, I don’t know how to say this, but I
think we got a shark problem. A real one.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Of course. Look – I’ve got some missing
persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: No one has seen a shark – no fin, no bites,
nothing. Be realistic.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I got a feeling. I have to act on it – you
can understand that, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Of course I can, but can’t it wait? These
things cost money, and this town doesn’t have much money.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: We have to do something.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: We have done something – hell, we damn near
went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach – it’s the only
one in 2000 miles, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I know, I know…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: And I stood by while you told the people
from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they’d need
$800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all
lost on that one.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s still a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Martin, when we build up our tax base a
little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town’s
broke.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Please, Larry – there’s good reason. Those
water skiers…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: A tragedy. But that was a boating accident;
no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Two of them are still missing!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: There’s always deaths in these waters that
never turn up. Are they all shark victims?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Maybe they are!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Bullshit? I’ll give you bullshit – there’s a
dead whale out there with bites all over it!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What am I, an ass? When you called me, I
called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Someone has to do something.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Don’t push it this time. If you do, it won’t
turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I’ve got to get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Come on, give a guy a break.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Hoo! Cold!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You bastard.
A little closer… Here y’go…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Chief?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I missed you at the funeral home. Santos
said you were here.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You didn’t miss much. Christ, what a
mess.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Positive I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: The woman passenger on the boat that blew
up.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What about that camera?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: What camera?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That one – from the wreck. You brought it up,
did you look inside it?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Well, what the hell – might be something
worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there’s film in it…</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: If there is, develop it!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I know just where to go.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Not the drugstore!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Of course not, They’re closed. Phil
Fogarty’s place. He’ll do it for me.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: The drugstore’s closed? What the hell time is
it?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Nine-thirty, ten maybe.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Shit – I’m late for dinner… Close up,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Oh yeah – I’m expecting a long distance call,
very important. Give them my home phone.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Thank you. I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sort of – Matthew Hooper is aboard the
research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won’t be
in radio range until half-past next spring.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Is Hooper coming to dinner?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Not till next year.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Oh, hi – How was dinner?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, perfect – a 75 per cent family affair.
Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Santos’ place.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Oww!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Careful. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Nothing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That’s what I said. Is there any of that hand
cleaner stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Use the little brush there. Why were you at
Santos’?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Found one of the missing victims from that
boat deal.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh. Want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Michael.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You want to come here a minute?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Hi Dad.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Hiya yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I got something for you to do tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I kind of had plans…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Sailing? Forget it. You’re beached. Grounded.
No more boats.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey, come on…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach,
and he’s got a job for you there. You can work until school starts.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: All summer?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: He wanted a job, he’s got one. I want to see
that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Dad, please…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Tomorrow night. Out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Not so loud!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I know what you’re going to say.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: In the city, it happened all the time – some
Kid o.d.’s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the
Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three
weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.
Call the cops. What are we, immune?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It was bad, wasn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: The goddamn smell is always the same.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Are you going to be able to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for
chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: This is the town beach; the development
naturally has its own private access, but I wanted you to see the
concession area. Look at that sand – like sugar!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: During the summer, the sun sets right there…
Over the water. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I’ll say hello for you.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Hello – selling some more of the good
life?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: A piece here, a piece there, it all adds
up.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Your husband’s been here all morning.
What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: His job.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Your dad got you working?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I’m helping.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: You know where your dad is?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Up there.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Oh, for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: And if you have any questions about
recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer
them.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Len, can I see you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: I think we got a couple of live ones.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Brody’s riding his tower.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: This is fun! Can we go faster?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Trim.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s my dad!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Wave to my son.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: How the hell do we get him down from
there?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Maybe nobody will notice. Let’s get them
back in the bus.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bryant</strong>: Renee wants to know what that man is
doing way up there?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: He’s, ah, watching. A lookout.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bryant</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It’s a shark tower. I saw one in Florida.
He’s looking for sharks.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: It’s an observation platform. That’s our
Chief of Police. He’s just checking it.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Normally, it’s used for, ah, bird
watching. Nature observation. Weather measurements, that sort of thing.
Ellen, we’re running late!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Okay. Folks, if we could get back on, we’ll
show you the country club, and stop for lunch…</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: The country club has an 18-hole course,
putting greens, and twelve tennis courts…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Out of the water! Everyone out of the
water!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get
out! Now! Out of the water!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: What the hell is he doing?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Out of the water! Now! Everyone!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin! No!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No! Don’t go in! Stay out! Stay clear!</p>
<p><strong>lifeguard</strong>: It’s bluefish! It’s a school of bluefish!
Chief! It’s bluefish!</p>
<p><strong>a swimmer</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>another swimmer</strong>: Fish! Anyone got a net?</p>
<p><strong>3rd swimmer</strong>: Someone get me a rod and reel!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Sorry. I’m sorry. False alarm…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Okay, it’s all over, go on, it’s over. No
trouble…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s okay. It’s over…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s all right, everything’s all right…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Let’s go, everyone… Mrs. Bryant, Len,
please…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Brody’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: Nobody says he isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: You should’ve been out there. You
should’ve seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots
fired!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: He thought he had a good reason.</p>
<p><strong>ms. nichols</strong>: But that’s not rational behavior!</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: That’s what I’m saying!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: How many people were there?</p>
<p><strong>ms. nichols</strong>: Hundred! Literally hundreds. What are
they going to say about us?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Larry, I’m a businessman, trying to make a
buck like anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: So? So?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: So it can’t be done like that. The man’s a
menace, plain and simple.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Look, what am I supposed to do? It’s done,
it’s over. We have to deal with the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>sansom</strong>: That’s what we’re here to do.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: All right. Let’s go into my office, where we
can have a little privacy.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I believe we have a quorum, and informally,
I suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with
minutes…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Polly, no calls, please… Okay, okay. Hello…
Phil? Fogarty? What pictures… I’ll be right down…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know what you did, but that kid
stopped. I haven’t heard one peep, not one ‘breaker breaker’ for days.
Believe me, it’s a pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You said something about a camera.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sure, sure – Jeff Hendricks brought in this
camera, see, from underwater, and I didn’t know how to get it open, but
my brother-in-law, in Montauk, he works at a hi-fi store, and they sell
cameras, so he…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Did you get any pictures?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, yeah, I did, that’s the funny thing. You
can’t tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow ’em up. Here’s a
test I did…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Oh, Jesus. That boat…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not bad – that’s a real fast lens, probably
1.4. Look at the diffusion, though…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What else you got?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Let’s see – you got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Come on, Phil, don’t jerk me around.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, okay – stand over there…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That one there. That one…</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Speak of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Thank God you guys were all together. I got
something for you. Proof!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Martin, this is kind of an official
meeting</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Perfect. Look at this —</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Chief – the Board of Selectmen has a
question only you can answer.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as
an interim Chief of Police in your absence?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Temporarily? Uh… sure… The question’s out of
left field. Why are they asking?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: So Jeff could handle things? He knows the
routine, he has the authority?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Yeah. Why?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: It came up during the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Look – I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It
was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was
right, all along.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: Seaweed?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: It’s underwater, isn’t it? That’s why it’s
so dark.</p>
<p><strong>sansom</strong>: I don’t know – what is it?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s a shark! A Great White! Jesus, it’s
right there!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: It’s nothing I can see.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What are you all, blind? It’s a shark. Look –
teeth, jaw, gills.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Is that what it is?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You’re damn right that’s what it is.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: I’m sorry, I just don’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Martin, it could be anything.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What the hell does it take to make sense to
you numbskulls? Jesus, it’s right there in front of you. I know what a
goddamn shark looks like, I’ve been through it, don’t you understand?
I’ve seen this sonofabitch before!</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: What have you seen before? This is
nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in the lens.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: My ass!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Be reasonable, please…</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Forget it, he won’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: There is nothing to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Will you listen to this man? Will you just
listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up
the place, God knows who could’ve been injured – what if somebody
decides to sue us? That could ruin us.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I’ll pay
for it. Take it out of my salary.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: You don’t make enough.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Maybe I don’t make as much money as some
bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don’t work the same way.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It means I don’t like all that grab- ass and
heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who’s out to screw me
here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I’ve
been there – and I don’t want to go through that horror again. Ever!</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Martin, could you wait here for a few
minutes while we make up our minds about something?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Go ahead, whatever it’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: I won’t mention his personal attack on
me.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: I’ve never seen him like this.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: And Hendricks is qualified, you heard that
from his own mouth.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: We made a motion and it was already
seconded.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Very well then. It is moved and seconded
that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police, his
contract with the township be terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks be
appointed Acting Chief in the interim. Those in favor?</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I’m sorry, but I respect his convictions.
The motion is carried.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Martin? Could you come in please?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hi. I closed a sale today, without Len.
That’s $1200 commission, if the papers go through.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sean’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That’s great too. Gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You look about 22 years old sitting there.
Like you were doing homework…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What’d I say?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That you were fired.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Then that’s what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out
on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.
Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Because of today? The beach?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the
city, you can go to Bloomingdale’s without waiting six hours for the
ferryboat… we’re surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me,
surrounded by water… Ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Stop that! We’re not going any place. You
love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Showed them the photo, showed them the
goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn’t see it. Not like me. Not like
the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li’l picture… He’s out there,
somewhere… I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired
me…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Honey, this is nothing… I don’t know what it
is. What did they…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: …Everybody wants the job. No one wants the
authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious
boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.
Call me in New York… tell him to kiss my ass…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: They have no right to treat you like that.
You’ve given them everything. For four years, you’ve protected this
town, the people on this island…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Fired me! I’m not a hysterical man. I’m
responsible. I know what I saw…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I know you did…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I try. Goddamnit, I tried… Now, I’m tired… I
can’t keep fighting it… I’m too tired… I’m… I’m…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re drunk is what you are…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Take it easy… Easy…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Is dad home? I heard something…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy’s
sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s what I want – a gaff rig.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go
anywhere. Look at this – the Mayan, an Alden schooner.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, Mike – I saw your dad over at the town
hall.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Did he really freak out at the beach?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, it’s all bullshit. Anyone want to play
pong for money?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How was the show?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yech.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: It was okay.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’d rather go the lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Who wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Anyone want to go the lighthouse?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Now? At night?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. My folks
left two cases of beer in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Is it still there?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Nope. Got it in my boat.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: All-right.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Let’s go for it.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Mike, you going?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why shouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I thought you might still be painting the
restrooms at the beach.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Anyone want a coke or anything?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’d like to go out to the lighthouse with
you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m not sure I can.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: It’ll be fun, come on!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the
town beach…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: No way. Everybody’s going sailing. If you
don’t want to take me, just say so.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That’s not it. My dad told me not to go.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You do everything your parents tell you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Good. I’ll be on the dock at eight. Eight
o’clock, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I really want to to be there. Who’s bringing
the wine? And who’s got a quarter for the box?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: She just likes to tease. I think she really
likes you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You’re going out.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You’re going sailing.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Take me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I want to go with you!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Quiet! Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Michael…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Okay, okay. Close your door.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Good morning, America…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’re you going to do today?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain
things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’ll give notice.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Don’t rush into it – we may need the
income.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Mike left early. Couldn’t wait to make out.
Must be a morning man.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. silvera</strong>: Morning. Anything special today?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sean’s not up yet. You know what he likes,
just some Fruit Loops and milk. No candy.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano,
or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what’s his
name…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. silvera</strong>: Frankie. He’s my cousin.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an
apprentice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. silvera</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If you’re beached, why are we doing this? For
practice?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Then why are we futzing around the dock? We
can make a few bucks working at the beach.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Look – if you’re going to get in the way, you
can just go home.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I’m not in the way. Andy, am I in the way?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re always in the way.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: This guy giving you any trouble?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Put me down!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Put him down in the water.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You want to go out in my boat?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Would you take him?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’ve just made someone very happy.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Mike! Are you going out?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I thought you were grounded.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I can go out if I want to.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You can?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You going to the lighthouse?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I could give you a dozen good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay, okay, don’t say I didn’t remind you.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Is there room on your boat for all of
us?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, we’re pretty crowded, and I don’t know
when we’re leaving…</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: I’ve got room.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Great. That’s okay – I’ll go with Timmy.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: You will?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Fan-tas-tic!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Come on, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Please come with us?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: For me…?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What the hell. For you…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I thought you said she was going with us?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Let’s just go sailing, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Want to swim home?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Hey! Nicholas! You’re supposed to be in
class!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Today I’m staying topside. You dive for
me!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’m going for lobster.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Great! Find one for me.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: With butter, if they got any…</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: So long, turkies.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Sparky will take you down today. If
everyone’s got a buddy, we’ll drop.</p>
<p><strong>crosby</strong>: Let’s get some dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Get us in! For Christ’s sake, get us in!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up
like this?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Just like this.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What about sailing?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The tide’s running. It’ll take us to the
light.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: It’ll take us to Budapest if you’re not
careful.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: First things first.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What about the others?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: They’ll be there when we get there. Might even
have a fire started.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What’re we going to do in the mean time?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I dunno. We’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But first, a little juice…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: And second?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Wait a minute. Promise me something.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Anything. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: That you’ll put down a blanket. I’ve got black
and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom’s getting uptight about
them.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Faster! Faster!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Coming about…</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Great day! I think the wind’s going to
change…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Coming up.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m getting new sails, then watch out. Just a
question of modifying the rigging!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Wheee! Faster!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How fast is enough?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I want to go faster!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hang on…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You coming up on him?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You bet. Hang on…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Coming up! Give way!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Like hell! We’re on the starboard tack!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Don’t let him pass. Faster!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: My hair’s getting wet!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: When do we get to the lighthouse?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Soon, dark eyes, soon.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: The tide’s turning.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’re going to be fighting the current. Wind’s
backing around a few points, too.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I can’t wait to get there.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But of course.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hey – it’s not your job any more. I’m going
to be late for work.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Just one minute…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood. Came up
too damn fast. Held his goddamn breath!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Easy…</p>
<p><strong>crosby</strong>: He panicked! Something scared him!</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: It’s okay. We’re taking care of him.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: How’d this happen?</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Bite reflex, like a spasm.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Right after, the Kids went out?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What Kids? Who went out?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie
Peters, Pat, Lucy – all that whole gang.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mike? Our Mike?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Yep. Looked like they were headed to the
lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: How long ago?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: About an hour, maybe two. Let’s see – I
came on about eight…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Going out.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Uh, Chief – look. You’re not Chief any
more.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: I can’t let you take her out.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You can’t stop me.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Mrs. Brody, look – if he can’t go, then
you can’t go. Neither of you can go.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Mike’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: But I signed for the boat. You’re not
authorized any more.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Untie that rope.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Please. It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Mrs. Brody, please…</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: You’re too close. Back off.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope
there.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Let me. Please.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hurry, please.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: What the hell, they can’t fire both of us
– someone’s got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Find the Kids. The lighthouse – you said
something about the lighthouse. Get us there.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over.</p>
<p><strong>harbor patrol</strong>: Harbor Patrol. Is that you,
Brody?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Affirmative. Can you get your chopper
airborne?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: 10-4, in a few minutes. He’s down
checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old
lighthouse. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: There’s a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.
Turn them back to port.</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: That’s it. Just do it, all right?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: 10-4, soon as I can raise him.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: If they’re not at the light, look for them. I
don’t want them out there. Get them back to port!</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the
Kids day-sailing back to port. I heard you. Patrol out.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Starving. Let’s go eat now.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: We’re going in to eat!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hey! Brody! Want to race?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How about a side bet to make it
interesting?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: That’s fun! Let’s race for something!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Name it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Loser sails home alone.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re betting what you already got.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sure you do – you win either way.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’m supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s a bet. Once around the marker buoy?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That’s the pin – the buoy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Turkeys! Eat wind!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yee-hah!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Can’t – we’re watching a race!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Since when? Who’s racing?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Larry and Mike!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home
alone!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: If we beat them, they can both go home
stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand
going in…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Your ass I will. Besides, the wind’s turning
with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Air Patrol to Base. I have visual contact on
the Kids. Going down to use the loud hailer…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to port
immediately. Return – to – port – immediately.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Your dad must be really pissed.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We better go back in.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s not going to be easy.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’re fighting wind and current. I though we’d
be out longer, catch the incoming tide.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Putz – that won’t be for hours.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I was counting on hours.</p>
<p><strong>chopper</strong>: Return – to – port.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’re trying, we’re trying.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Heading back?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Might as well.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: They’re turning around.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Coming about, then.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Are we going back?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Make that the Titanic.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Patrol One to Base. Looks like they’re
turning back.</p>
<p><strong>control</strong>: All right, Patrol. Go back to work. You’ve
wasted enough time.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Michael?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s not his boat.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Be careful…</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Nope… Hold on…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Tina!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: N-o-o-o-o-o-o…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay. What’s the matter?
Tina? Honey? Hey –</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: No! It’s still there!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What is it? What’s there?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: It’s still there!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I need a hand here…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tina, baby… what is it?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Sh… Sh… Shark…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I knew it. I goddamn well told them.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.</p>
<p><strong>patrol commander</strong>: This is Cape Patrol – what is it,
Brody? I heard you weren’t chief anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Skip that. What about those kids out
sailing?</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: It’s all okay – Colby got to them. They
were turning back when he left ’em.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: He left them?</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Sure. He’s got work to do in Bay
Channel.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Get him the hell back there! We got possible
fatalities! Brody out…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’m going out there.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Hey – you can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What is it? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Mike’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Get her in. Get them both in.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, please!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Chief, be sensible…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: About 10 degrees off your starboard bow,
take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by
northeast…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Never mind that shit. Just point.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: See where Cable Junction is? Look to the
left. The lighthouse. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Come back! Martin!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My purse is on that boat.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump up this
boat! And shave that silly moustache!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: England expects every man to do his duty… You
may fire when ready, Gridley… Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Someone pop your balloon?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No problem, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Want a lifesaver?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: How about a skyhook?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You sail your boat, I’ll sail mine.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey, Fetterman – You got company.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Company? The place is a mess…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Doug’s down!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Doug! This way!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So much for the rubber duck.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: A shark ate my boat.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m telling you, a goddamn shark ate my
goddamn boat!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If he liked your boat, I got some sneakers
he’ll love.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: …Jeez – what did that?… A porpoise, maybe…Nah,
killer whale… I think he snagged it… I hate to pop his balloon…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Raft up! Raft ’em up!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Tie off to your strongest point.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Anyone need an extra line?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Mike’s bleeding!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Can you sail?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Yeah! We’ll take him in!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One. Harbor
Air, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilot</strong>: This is Air One. That you, Brody?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s me. Any fix on those Kids?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Negative. I’m still down.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: For Christ’s sake, get going! I’m all alone
out here!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Brody, I got to switch frequencies, call my
boss. We’ll meet you over by Francis Shoal. Harbor Air out…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Where the hell is Francis Shoal?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’m all alone out here.</p>
<p><strong>runby</strong>: The Amity Police Boat, under full power,
surging through the heavy swell, Brody very much alone at the helm.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Anyone know what time it is?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: 3:30.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Tide doesn’t turn for three hours.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What’d you do? Memorize the tide tables?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I can’t help it, it sticks in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Anyone want to play charades?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: As long as we’re drifting, might as well go
with the flow.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Not funny.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Three knot current?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: At least. And an offshore wind.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What’s after Cable Junction?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The Atlantic. Then Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Can’t we stop?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: They’re probably looking for us.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What about the fish?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Maybe it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it’s
following Polo and Timmy.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: So all we have to do is land at Cable
Junction and wait.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: First we got to get there.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How’re we going to do that floating on this
garbage…?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Anyone got another set of sails?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Is that big thing still out there?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t everyone jump around!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Air One to Base. I have a positive location
on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift… …about 3/4 miles west of
Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. I
count ten juveniles.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Everyone okay? Any injuries?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Can you put us on Cable Junction?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I got no room for passengers.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How about a tow? Can you rig that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: As soon as you get us on the island, you got
to call in. My dad’s the mayor…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: There’s a shark…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You have to take us off! You have to! Why
don’t you take us!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s an observation spotter, he doesn’t have
the room…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Listen. I’m going to give you an assist to
get you on Cable Junction. Then I’ll call in, and get the Coast Guard to
send a cutter. Hang on to something.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: No-o-o-o!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t struggle!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sean!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Sean! Sean!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Andy! Please help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come
in.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Harbor Air, do you read? Over?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: Brody? This is Patrol Base.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Where the hell is Air One?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: That’s what I’d like to know. Lost
transmission at Cable Junction.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Did he raise the Kids?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: Last transmission said ten
juveniles.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Yeah? Then what?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: Then nothing. If you see him, tell him
to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Did you say Cable Junction?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: That’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>patrol voice</strong>: 1530 hours. Might still be there. Base
out.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sean! Catch the rope!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The rope! The rope!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: He’s got to help or it won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Sean, baby, please…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: It killed her. It ate her.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Shh. Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will
kick your ass, do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Listen to Andy, Sean.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’re throwing a rope and you better catch it,
hear?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Keep an eye out for that fish.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Throw it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sean! Catch it!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Larry!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Cable Junction’s ahead!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Can we make it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God, help us,
please…</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Keep her warm. Jackie? Baby?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Can someone help me rig a jury rudder? We
might steer this…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we’ll be
twenty miles out. More, with this wind.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I can’t stop thinking!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: God, please help us, Merciful Father, in
Christ’s name, we beg you, help us, please, Dear God, save us, help us,
please, God, help…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Thank Christ.</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: Over here! Yo!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’m coming alongside!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Mike? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Pop. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s okay. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: A shark hit us out there.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Mike got knocked over.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I passed out, but I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: At least you’re safe. What about the
others?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Jesus, don’t freeze on me. What about the
others?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sean’s still out there.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn’t it? It
was okay before…</p>
<p><strong>polo</strong>: The others are ratted together. Drifting.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: With the current. Towards Cable Junction.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Dad, I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Stay here. Don’t go anywhere. Just stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Stay at the lighthouse!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Bring her to port a little. That’s it –
steady.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I think we’re changing course a little.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Can we land on it?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: If we can get to it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: We’re going to die.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: It’s all right, we’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: More to port.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s all the way over.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Are we going to go on the island?</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: You bet, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What the hell, we’re steering for it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The wind drift is lateral.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sideways – For every yard we go this way, we
also slide sideways this way…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But we had it! We were headed right for
it!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Shit. Shit, shit, shit!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: We’re going to miss it!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Stop paddling!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But the island!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The Shark.</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’re hung up on something.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Maybe the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: It’s that thing. It’s going to kill us now…
We’re going to die!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shut up! Just shut Up!</p>
<p><strong>brooke</strong>: Leave her alone!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lighten up, man…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s bad enough without her freaking out.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: She’s hysterical, goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Don’t yell at her!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Wait a minute! Listen! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Over there! Coming this way!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It’s Dad!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Easy, easy – you’ll swamp us!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Back down!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We’re hung up here. Snagged.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Can you get us a line?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We got it!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Go ahead, slow.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Come around again!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hang on, hang on – we got it. You’re on!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Dad! Help!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Dad! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’m okay, baby, I’m here. It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Can you get a line to me?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Get the cable in! Pull!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Son of a bitch is stuck!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s killing us!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t want to die! Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Come on, you bastard, come on, pull.

<p><strong>brody</strong>: Hang on! Just hang on!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Dad! Help! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Andy! Use the lights! The lights!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Where are you? Chief!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Sean!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!</p>
