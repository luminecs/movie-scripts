<h1 id="we-own-the-night">we-own-the-night</h1>
<p><strong>a pair of smokestacks against an orange autumn sun
sky…</strong>: THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the
foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF MIDDLE-CLASS ROW
HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems to separate the two. A NEWLY
DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and
vital and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are stylish,
expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into:</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: …you’re so fuckin’ beautiful, you know
that…?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I love you, baby…</p>
<p><strong>muffled voice</strong>: Bobby! You in there?</p>
<p><strong>muffled voice</strong>: Bobby! you two could just keep your
hands off each other for a second–I, I think we got a situation brewin’
out front!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: It’s Jumbo… We gotta go anyway…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’ll be out in a second, Louis!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What the fuck’s goin’ on in here?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got
everything under control here–so uh, so I’m gonna go outside, take my
break!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah–just keep that wide load of yours
outta trouble, arright?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Yes, your fuckin’ majesty!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What’re you doing?!? You gotta behave
yourself here!</p>
<p><strong>bloodied patron</strong>: C’mon, Mr. Green! I didn’t do
nothing!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Well now you’re gonna do nothing
someplace else! Now listen–one of these days I’m gonna run this whole
block, and I see any you in here again–any you– I’ll bust your fuckin’
hole! Throw `em out on their ass. I gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys
with the old man.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Bobby! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Mr. Buzhayev, how are you!</p>
<p><strong>kalina buzhayev</strong>: So beautiful! Beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Listen, Mr. Buzhayev–I gotta go do
something right now. But don’t worry–everything’s in good shape
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Yes, good. You take care of things
good for us…</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Next week, you come by–we talk.
Okay? We talk about plans for you.</p>
<p><strong>kalina buzhayev</strong>: Bobby! Where you run off to?!?</p>
<p><strong>tilt down</strong>: WHITE PRESS-ON letters CROOKEDLY spelling
out</p>
<p><strong>york. a sign reads: “congratulations! to `captain
joseph</strong>: GRUSINSKY’“. Cases filled with trophies. Food tables,
piled high. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby’s OLDER
BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically so. Sharp, tough
features–the GLOW of a WINNER. He is SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED
CONGRATULATIONS and holding one of his children in his arms, infant
PAUL. Next to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their
older infant, TEDDY.</p>
<p><strong>next to joseph</strong>: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby’s
father, we will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex- military,
rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Here, take another one! Get
another!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Pop, they got enough! What’re you
doin’?!?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You want your face out there–it’s
good exposure. The PC’s gonna see this. C’mon. With both kids.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Thanks, Chief!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You see your brother yet?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: He ain’t gonna come.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: He better.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: C’mon. What’s the big deal anyway?
We’ll go in, you say hello, then we’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You remember what I tol’ you?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Yeah! Course!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Nobody knows about my father and my
brother–not even Jumbo. And it’s gotta stay that way, you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Yeah, you tol’ me a thousand times.
But I been with you for two years, Bobby–I should meet `em by now. We
goin’ in or not?</p>
<p><strong>steps</strong>: Bobby and Rosario–who’s being eyed up and
down salaciously by the men in the party. The two start to come down the
narrow stairs leading to the basement. A portly, ebullient man, RUSSELL
DE KEIFER:</p>
<p><strong>russell de keifer</strong>: Bobby? Bobby Grusinsky, that you?
How you doin’?!</p>
<p><strong>russell de keifer</strong>: It’s me, Russell De Keifer, from
across Northern Boulevard, remember? You still bartending that Russian
joint, out there in Brooklyn?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Nah. Nah, I’m managing now.</p>
<p><strong>russell de keifer</strong>: Oh, big shot!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah. I’ll see you `round, arright?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: What’d he call you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I changed my name–I use my mother’s
name now. It’s better for business. C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>young police reporter</strong>: Captain Grusinsky, hi! I’m
Officer Timpanaro from SPRING 3100, the police magazine–</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: How you doing…</p>
<p><strong>young police reporter</strong>: So: um, you are now the
third–</p>
<p><strong>young police reporter</strong>: The third youngest captain on
the Force, and our P.B.A. readers’ll wanna know just how that, um–
–Feels!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Feels like nothin’. Nah, it feels
good! I love trying to, you know, help make the City safer for people
and everything…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That’s them there. In the corner.
Lookit `em–two peas in a pod.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Yeah–I see `em! They don’t look that
bad though, you know? For cops? Who’re those other guys?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Father’s friends–they were all in Korea
together. Biggest bunch of fuckin’ stiffs… Look, don’t talk to nobody,
we’ll get out quicker.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I ain’t gonna embarrass you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: N–I just wanna get out quick, that’s
all…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Bobby, hey! You, you got off work
and everything–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah I did so…congratulations…</p>
<p><strong>simultaneous</strong>: Burt motions to JACK, MICHAEL. The two
WALK UPSTAIRS. Burt steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop. Everybody, this is my girlfriend.
Rosario.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Nice to meet you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: This’s my brother. And my father.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: We gotta talk to you. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: In a house of God, no less? C’mon, get
up…</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Hello, Bobby. Nice suit you got
on.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Your hair’s long.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I know. I like it this way. That why
you got me up here? tell me my hair’s too long?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Bobby, I asked Pop to bring you
here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Whatsamatter?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Well… I’m gonna be heading up a
new narcotics team, starting this week. A Russian unit, outta PSA 2 in
Brighton.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That’s a good hook for you.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Yeah, they need me over there.
There’s only eleven guys in the whole department that even know the
language right now, so…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You ever talk?</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: I’m old-fashioned. I listen first.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Bobby, we need you to do us a
favor.</p>
<p>****: A favor? Oh, he needs a favor!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You cut me off financially, and now you
need the favor? `S interesting.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: We’re looking at this guy Vadim
Nezhinski.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Served time in the Soviet Union
for black market activity, come over around 1979.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: `S good lookin’ boy!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: He’s dealing H, cocaine, angel
dust… Operates out of that club you manage. The El Caribe.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I don’t know nothing about that.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: No, we know that. We checked up
and down the rest of management, too–his uncle, the owner–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: The old man?! What, you been watching
us?!?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Everybody come up clean. It’s just
Nezhinski we’re lookin’ at.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: We need to track how he’s bringin’
in the product and…we were just hopin’ you’d keep your eyes and ears
open a little.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You kidding me? Inform for you?!?
That’s what you wanted me here for?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: No, we would never ask you to do
that. Just observe, that’s all. It’s a closed community and you’re our
only way in right now–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah well, find another way. I got a
lot invested in that club and I can’t let it get fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Nothing’s gonna get fucked up,
Bobby. All it takes is one thing, you know that! One guy to flip, we
crack the whole thing!</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Bobby, it’s important. These ain’t
dumb guys we’re talking about. We don’t stop `em up front, coupla years
from now, it’ll be chaos out there.</p>
<p>****: We’d be wishing the Italians’d come back.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Fuckin’ broadsided me… Everything’s
about the goddamned job with you.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Whole city’s falling apart, Bobby–
don’t you got any sense of responsibility at all?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: C’mon… Get off your fuckin’ high horse
and bust somebody else’s balls.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: All right, go downstairs. Lemme talk
to him.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Just be careful out there next
coupla weeks.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: ’S that supposed to mean?!?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Joseph!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Congratulations. You got me up
here.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: I knew you wouldn’t help us. I told
your brother, I said, `no point even bringing him down here.’</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Good. Then now you know.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Hold on a second–lemme ask you a
question. That girl of yours downstairs–she Puerto Rican?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah. I like the dark meat.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: She hooking you up?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Why, you want some?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Yeah, keep laughing–your mother,
rest in peace, I think she was too easy on you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I gotta go, Pop. I’ll see you
`round.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: Everyone? Everyone!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: You take a picture, it’ll last
longer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: C’mon, let’s get outta here, go party
with Jumbo.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: We could stay if you want, baby. They
don’t like me, I don’t care– you’re better than them anyway–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: We’re goin’. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: I’m Deputy Commissioner Spiro</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: You know, we look around in these
troubled times, and in moments like this we need leaders, men and women
who can bring order back to our great communities. We’re here this
holiday season to give thanks for one of these men, our Russian brother,
Joseph Grusinsky.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: …Joseph, many of us’ve known your
father, Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky, for many years, and I know he wants
to say a little something. Chief?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Thank you. You know, I used to tell
my kids, “work first, play later,” and my son Joseph really took it to
heart. He’s been a real fighter over the years… He overcome his mother’s
passing, and the dyslexia–eventually wound up graduating John Jay as
salutatorian and distinguished himself many times. Anyway, you’ve shown
yourself to be very brave and selfless, and I’m just, I’m very proud
here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Thank you everybody for coming–
happy Thanksgiving. Before I say anything else… We got some bad news
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: One of our Irish brothers was
killed in the line of duty last night–detective Edward Conlon was gunned
down serving a warrant on Northern Boulevard. The clock’s about to
strike ten, so I thought we might give a moment of silence to
remember.</p>
<p><strong>music up</strong>: PRINCE’S “HOUSEQUAKE.” Hot girls and
flashy- looking guys. The men are drinking. The women make themselves up
en masse in front of a large mirror over the sofa. A couple KISSES in
the corner. Everyone’s getting ready for a night of revelry on the town.
They are SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70’s, though
not exaggeratedly so. DRUGS are EVERYWHERE. We</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I’m gonna be like Madonna. You think
I’m like Madonna…?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: We’re both Leos, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You’re just like her, baby…</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I talked to my mother yesterday. She
said she’d be okay by herself, so I could move in if I want…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Your family ain’t gonna be too happy,
though. I saw how they looked at me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It’s all right–they don’t like nobody
outside their own little world.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Yeah…you know, cops’re fucked up. In
my neighborhood, if they ain’t taking money, they’re beating on you for
no reason…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: My brother and my father ain’t like
that. It’s just–the whole thing ain’t for me, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You know how gorgeous you are?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I got you something.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Open it up!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: …it’s beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: …you’re so good to me…</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I love you… And someday we’re gonna
get a big house together, in New Jersey, with a lotta kids…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Only if you behave yourself…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Uh oh– party’s really gonna get started
now!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Yeah–let’s all play Spin my
Pickle!</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: Hey Falsetti! You get what we wanted?</p>
<p>****: Indeed I did, my friend! See, I woulda been here sooner, `cept
I hadda go across town, lose all the cops–</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: There weren’t no cops following us!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Shut your mouth! You wouldn’t
recognize `em–they were, they were all undercover.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Anyway, I got a little of what
everybody asked for here. I got uppers, downers, hash, mescaline, some
blow-</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Any Spanish Fly in there for you?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Yeah, you need that, not me!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: And what’s with the suit anyway? You
look like a monkey in the circus!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m goin’ up to see Buzhayev tonight. I
think he’s gonna ask me to buy into the club.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Yeah? Well, you know what you should
do, you should turn it into a fag joint and then maybe they’ll let ya
in!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’ll show you a fuckin’ faggot!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Everybody, I gotta be at El Caribe in
an hour, so get ready!</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: The spot’s got one main entrance, two
rear fire exits. All of `em’ll be covered.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Good. I just wanna make sure we
take it easy in there. We don’t want no panic.</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: What if your brother’s inside?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: It’s his day off. He ain’t gonna
be there.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: What if he is? We still go?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: What’s it gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>kalina buzhayev</strong>: Bobby! Our daughter and her husband
Eli come by for dinner. You want something, some tea?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: No no, I’m all right… Hi everybody…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Everything’s really rockin’ tonight.
Line’s halfway `round the block.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Yes, it’s good…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You wanted to talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: You know, maybe we open another spot
next year. Across from Brighton.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: ’S a good move.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: We need someone in charge here full-
time, then. And we think you do a great job.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I appreciate that. You know, I been
thinking `bout it–I’d like to become a partner here too–buy in with
you.</p>
<p>****: I mean, I got a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>****: Already! He’s got so many ideas!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Well, I just think we could do more.
Maybe expand into Sheepshead Bay. I know a good spot–we add a restaurant
there, get the spill- over. Like what your brother did, in Miami.</p>
<p><strong>eli mirichenko</strong>: That’s gonna take a lot of money,
Papa. Your fur business can support that right now?</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: My son-in-law, he worries people
take advantage of me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I can understand that. But I got money
to invest–we could make it something real special over there. Do what I
did downstairs–you know, bring in name DJs on different nights?</p>
<p>****: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Yes. Together we do it. You come to
our Thanksgiving again, on Thursday?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah, sure. I’ll come.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Good–we talk more, at the
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Give him, for tonight!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Nah nah, no thank you…</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: My brother! How’d it go? Ho, well!
I’m guessing it went pretty good then!</p>

be a host. In one of our spots.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: That’s my specialty. I’m whaddaya

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Well, just make sure you get your old
co-workers from the Health Department to give us a pass on the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Yeah, no problem–half of `em got
rats as pets anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Where’s Rosario?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Goddamnit… With that fuckin’ animal

<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: She’s a player, Bob. You know how it

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Look at him… I’ll tell you, this is my
place, we’ll kick his fuckin’ ass right outta here–</p>
<p>****: Bob! You gotta watch your mouth! I mean, he don’t scare me, but
uh, but trust me, I know.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah, you know a lot.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: I do, I’m serious! Last year, one of
his guys was gonna flip? Jesus Christ, what I saw…</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Nezhinski dragged him into the
toilet. They stood him up against the wall and held him–</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: They fuckin’ pulled down his pants,
and I swear to God, Nezhinski just cut it off.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Worst thing I ever seen in my life,
Bob.</p>
<p>****: Anyway, cops found his head in the middle of Brighton Avenue
the next day–fuckin’ dick was in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You sure it wasn’t your dick?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Yeah, that’s funny.</p>
<p>****: You sure it wasn’t your mouth?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Shit… I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Hi, honey!</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Bobby–c’mon, join us! I wanna talk
to you!</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: This is the fuckin’ guy right here.
Practically owns the place.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Everything all right with you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Things’re goin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: That’s real good…
<code>Cause you gotta be happy, you know? All my guys, I tell</code>em,
the mind and the body, they’re connected. That’s how you stay sharp.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: This’s “Kid Quick” you’re talking
to, dude. Best fuckin’ middleweight in the Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: He don’t look like a middleweight no
more.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You know Bobby, my uncle upstairs,
he, he likes you a lot. Practically thinks you’re one of his kids.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Your uncle’s a great man. Smart
man.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Yeah… Smart smart stupid. Got his
head buried in books all day, `stead of the real world…</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Listen uh, I come to you, I tell
you I got some friends bringin’ a load in here, maybe something big– I’m
just talking now–they bring it in, how do you feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Your uncle loses his license, he ain’t
gonna be too happy.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Well, upstairs don’t gotta know
everything, am I right? Place gets packed every night, everybody
wins.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You know, you should think about
comin’ in with us. You’re popular– you could help us…expand a little. A
lotta money in it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah…I’ll think about that. Rosario–I
wanna talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Go ahead. We’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: It go good upstairs, baby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You gotta stop dealing. You hear what
I’m telling you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Yeah, I heard. But I need the money
right now, Bobby. And I’m not gonna rely on you for</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Just hold off then, for a little while.
Okay? I got my reasons.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I love you…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Everybody! Get your hands on your
head and don’t fuckin’ move! Turn off that music. Right now!</p>
<p><strong>cops</strong>: Holy shit! Get the extinguishers– call
paramedics!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Gimme your shit!</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Hey! I saw that! Get your hands on
your fuckin’ head!</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Jessie! This one just ingested!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Arright, open up–a little charcoal, to
absorb the toxin…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Give everybody a toss. G.Q.–</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Too much pizza, right there.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Turn around… Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p>****: Want me to double your money? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Okay. It’s doubled now, how’s
that.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: You got anything in there?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Jesus, that cop’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Hey! Fat Albert! Shut your fuckin’
mouth!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: You got a cross AND a Jewish star
on you?</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: The cross is for good luck.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: What’s the star for?</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: That one’s for God.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Coupla dimes on `em–cocaine, a little
PCP.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Okay, let’s go. You. And you–
You’re under arrest, possession and sale of narcotics–</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Your boy’s gonna turn. And then
we’ll come back for you.</p>
<p><strong>portly cop</strong>: Jesus Christ, what the hell’s goin’ on
in here?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Russian guy fuckin’ slashed
himself!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Where you going? I was the one who
got you outta there!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You’re a real big shot, aren’t you!
You see what happened in there last night? Hey–I’m talking to you!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You know, you and your girlfriend’re
only getting off `cause of your brother. Up to me, you’d sit in there
another couple days.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Okay, I’ll go thank him too then. He
comes in, raids the fuckin’ place–now I gotta go beg `em not to fire
me–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Fire you?! From what? Probably the
best thing that ever happened to you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Fuck you, Pop. Fuck the both of
you’s.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Don’t EVER speak to me like that
again. You hear me? I’ll rap you right in the mouth!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You fuckin’ touch me!? You gonna
fuckin’ touch me?!?</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: No no–it’s okay. Say hello…</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Now–we go this week to the field,
okay? To ride the horses? Go to Mama.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Mr. Buzhayev… I’m real sorry about what
happened the other night.</p>
<p>****: I was working, maybe I would’ve been able to do something, but…
Anyway, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: It’s not your fault…</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: You can’t always control everyone in
your family…</p>
<p>****: My nephew, he don’t come back to the club anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You don’t mind my saying, I think
that’s probably the right thing to do.</p>
<p>****: Things get back to normal, I’m hoping we could get started on
what we talked about.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: We need time for the bad publicity
to go away.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested ain’t
gonna be a problem. I don’t got a record–</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: I know. I don’t worry about any of
that.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: I used to teach chemistry before I
come over here, and now I have the fur store, and this. One thing I
learned here, you can always start over. So don’t worry–someday, we do
it. Okay? Someday.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah… All right…</p>
<p><strong>kalina buzhayev</strong>: Food is ready!</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: You take some time off, everything
will be fixed in a little bit. Then you come back. I pay you for the
time. Come on…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: He stabbed himself, he was a
bundle guy. Mighta known how they’re movin’ it. See, that’s the key–</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: We waited `til it was your day
off.</p>
<p>****: We had to go–I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You had to hit that spot.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Nezhinski was seen there, Bobby!
What am I supposed to do–announce it in advance, compromise the whole
thing?</p>
<p>****: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I had plans down there.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Yeah, well, I tried. What do you
want from me, anyway? You know, you’re standing there feeling sorry for
yourself, but you wouldn’t be in this shit if you didn’t fuck around in
the first place.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You got real balls saying that to me. I
made something for myself, and you come in and fuck it up? Just `cause
I’m not trying to be like you? And Pop–</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Bobby, you’re the one acting like
you’re above it all all the time!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Fuckin’ around with your little
Puerto Rican all day–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What did you call her?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: You heard me. Have some fucking
class for once.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You piece of shit…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: go around like you’re a big shot…
You’re a joke! Grow up already! Fuckin’ loser…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: You come at me like that…?</p>
<p>****: Don’t come around me no more–I don’t wanna have to look at your
fuckin’ face ever again.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Fine with me, you motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: I don’t know, Joe–forgive me, but uh,
your brother… Ever since your mother got sick–</p>
<p>****: Do me a favor, don’t get involved.</p>
<p>****: We’ll pick this up tomorrow. I’m gonna go home.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Get us onto the expressway…
Move!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You gotta keep your hands up! Keep
your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Chief…?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Which kid is it?</p>
<p><strong>police chaplain</strong>: It’s Joseph. He’s at St. John’s
Hospital.</p>
<p>****: It don’t look good right now.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: You want us to contact your other
son–?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: No. Go on, I’ll be right out…</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: What’re you lookin’ at?!?</p>
<p>****: It’s got nothing to do with you…</p>
<p><strong>random boxing officers</strong>: Chief! Chief, you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Baby, you got a little bruise
here–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That ain’t nothing.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: I got a bruise too, you know–right
here!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: So Bob, I think we fold.</p>
<p>****: We fold, right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: We’ll see you and bump you two C’s.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: We will?</p>
<p><strong>stocky latino man</strong>: Call.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two fucking
queens!</p>
<p><strong>stocky latino man</strong>: Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Bobkes, I love you!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby–it’s for you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: I was the one told him to keep
goin’!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Bobby, it’s Michael Solo–I got some
bad news.</p>
<p>****: Your brother’s been shot. He’s at St. John’s–they’re workin’ on
him now. I just thought you should know.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Is–is he gonna be all right?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Listen, your father’s coming–I gotta
go. But he’s at St. John’s.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: My brother was shot…they’re operating
on him now.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: You gotta go see him–be there for him
and your father.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Game’s over, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>stocky latino man</strong>: What, you shuttin’ it down?!?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That’s right. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Bobkes–? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>stocky latino man</strong>: Fuck you, man! We’re in deep
here!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I wanna come too. For you–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: No–it’s gonna be a fuckin’ scene. I’ll
call you later.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Don’t argue.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Louis, lock up and take her home.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Sure, Bob. Everything cool?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah, no–I just remembered I gotta do
something, that’s all–</p>
<p><strong>other players</strong>: Hey–HEY! What the fuck?!?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Take it easy, TAKE IT EASY! Calm
down and everything’ll be, uh, non compos mentis!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop, he all right?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: What do you want? You stayed out of
it–you got what you wanted. Why don’t you go somewhere and pick a
fight–you’re good at that!</p>
<p><strong>mustachioed cop</strong>: Chief, the union sent a shrink over
for you–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Nah, I don’t want that crap.</p>
<p><strong>enter</strong>: someone we recognize as the MAYOR storms in
with his ENTOURAGE. The COMMISSIONER and Deputy Commissioner Spiro
Giavannis are with him too. They approach Burt. Bobby moves aside.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Hello, your honor. Commissioner.
Thank you for coming.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Chief Grusinsky, an attack on an officer is
an attack on society. Whoever did this, in a clean neighborhood like
that–they gotta be hunted down like animals.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: We’ll get
<code>em, your honor. I'm gonna come back in and run it myself--we'll get</code>em.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: The shot went in his cheek and come
out through the jaw. It missed his brain, thank God.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: He was real lucky–considering.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I need to see him…</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Bobby–that ain’t a good idea.</p>
<p>****: I probably should’ve told you not to come down here–there’re a
lotta things going on right now.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You guys blaming me for this? Is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Listen, I ain’t judging you–I called
you `cause I thought you had a right to know. But we’re gonna be going
hard after Nezhinski–and maybe some other people you’re close to. Like
that girl you know–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That’s bullshit–she’s clean. You
fuckin’ keep away from her.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry. Nobody’s allowed in except immediate
family.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You got some I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Good evening. As a friendly reminder,
visiting hours will be over in five minutes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Says here your name is “Green.”</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Look–I’m his brother, you fuckin’
hard-on!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sandra grusinsky</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>sandra grusinsky</strong>: He’s alone. Your father just left
for the precinct.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sir…?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sir, I’m sorry–I.C.U. visiting hours are
over.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: …Feels like it was my fault…</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Where’d you run off to, like a Jew?
You got outta there, it became like a real zoo. The spics– `Scuse me–the
P.R.s, they’re goin’ nuts for the money–picka picka picka picka–and the
girls, they’re screamin’, and I’m keepin’ everybody in line. I’m fuckin’
bustin’ heads, like Bruce Lee–I’m fuckin’ bustin’ heads–</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Hercules, do me a favor–before you kill
a waitress, go pay the check.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Arright. But I’ll tell you Bobkes,
nobody else could ever do for you what I did.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Don’t tell Louis nothing about what
happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I ain’t ever gonna say nothing! I just
thought…maybe he could cheer you up a little.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Hey, look who’s here!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Hey Vadim… We were just gettin’
something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You make it through that bust
okay?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I didn’t have nothing on me.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Glad to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Your uncle’s got some problems now,
though.</p>
<p>****: He does what he gotta do, I do what I gotta do. He don’t own
me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Baby–why don’t you go keep Jumbo
company, make sure he leaves a tip.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: `Kay…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi, Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You know–</p>
<p>****: I still got my shit coming in. Some of us think you could help
get it out there.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It’s a little dangerous right now,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: We got a lot of muscle behind us.
Lotta muscle.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Muscle–?</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: A cop got hit today. They ain’t never
gonna sit still for that.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Police are a fuckin’ joke, dude–
the Mickey Mouse ain’t gonna do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Bobby, those cops–they, they ain’t
no problem.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You see this? I got this on the
inside, at Tchita. You earn these.</p>
<p>****: So don’t worry–we’ll get
<code>em all. Cut off the head, the body'll fall, right? You keep on doin' it</code>til
they get the message. We got all their names. On a list.</p>
<p>****: Just think about it. You change your mind, you call Pavel.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’ll see you around…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant provenzano</strong>: Everybody! Our little “A” House
got another coupla stiffs today, so it’s time for another poem! “The
people of Brooklyn have been volleyed and thundered; at last the number
slaughtered has reached one hundred!”</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I need to find Deputy Chief
Grusinsky.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant provenzano</strong>: Oh, uh, he’s on the second
floor, I think. In the muster room.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop, I gotta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It’s important–I got information.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It’s about you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding
me!</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Nezhinski got a hit list? On us?!?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: We gotta go bust `em, Burt–right
now.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: No. They’ll be back on the street in
a day. We gotta try and catch `em with their hands full–find out where
they got the real weight. Then we can move.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: That could take us forever!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Doesn’t matter. It’s our only
play.</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: I say we go hit
<code>em all. Wipe</code>em out, suicide-by-cop–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about?! C’mon,
don’t be a first-class schmuck!</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: But we don’t got the time to
infiltrate `em–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Then we make the time! Look, I want
you all to understand something–we don’t ever play in the dirt here,
okay? Not ever, no matter what!</p>
<p>****: You piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: What about callin’ in the Feds? They
got a lot more juice than we</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Bunch of college boys from Kansas.
We protect our own here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop, Nezhinski’s been talkin’ about a
shipment he’s got comin’. Maybe that’s how you get to him.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: How you know about that, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: They been wanting me to buy in for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Well, maybe that’s it, then. If we can
get him– To set something up, maybe one of our uncles could move in–</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: It’d have to be him–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Forget it, both of you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What do you mean, set something up?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: You’d go set up a buy with
<code>em, just like they've been asking you to. We follow you to the spot, bust</code>em
a week later. That way, your name’s clean, nobody knows you’re
involved–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: That’s too dangerous for him! We
don’t know how solid his cover is out there! That girlfriend of yours,
she knows about you, right? So can we just get back to the discussion
please?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You could trust her.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Good. I’m glad. But it’s not
happening. So forget it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: But…but you could get killed–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Don’t worry about me, just worry
about yourself, arright? Anything happens with your brother I’ll call
you. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p>****: They said on the television your brother was doing better.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Me and my mother, we said a prayer for
him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Your mother’s real important to you,
ain’t she. You’d do anything for her.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Yeah, I guess…</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: You thinking about your brother? About
your family?</p>
<p>****: There was nothing you could do…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Go back to sleep…</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby? It’s all gonna work out… You’ll
see…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You been up to see my brother…?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Yeah. Your father’s still with him-
-we were just gonna go back to the PSA. Try and figure out a tac plan on
Nezhinski.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: …How’s that been goin’…?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: We don’t got much yet, but we’ll do
our best.</p>
<p>****: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Well I… I been thinking…if you could
keep it confidential…?</p>
<p>****: I’d make the connection for you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: They trust me–we could go in large, use
my money for the buy, they won’t suspect anything–</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: It’s too dangerous–you heard your
father.</p>
<p>****: He don’t gotta know anything about it. Does he?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: If anything went wrong, he’d never
forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>****: It’s just–I realized… ….my father dies `cause of all this, I
couldn’t live my life knowing I coulda done something. I know the same
is true for you. I know it is.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: So please–can we do this…?</p>
<p><strong>accented voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Hey. It’s Bobby Green.</p>
<p>****: I decided–I wanna buy in.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: How much we talkin’ `bout here,
dude?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Fifty k, to start.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Oh, man’s gonna be good with that.
How `bout tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Arright. We’ll meet at El Caribe,
`round midnight? That way, you could dance a little, say hi to your
girlfriend…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Okay. I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Most expensive phone call I ever
made.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: We’ll get it back for you.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Now listen: from now on, you’ll get
all your information through this, at an undisclosed location. Your
contact with us is over after you leave here.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Just be smart about things. Okay? You
get burnt and we gotta put you in protection, it’s still better than
winding up dead. An informant dies, they talk about you for a day. A
week later, ain’t no one remembers your name.</p>
<p>****: Moral of the story is, don’t die. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You need to promise me something,
though. You won’t investigate my girlfriend–she’s, she don’t know any
better.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: She won’t be a target. Just make sure
she don’t open her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: You know we known you your whole life,
kid? Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz’s voice</strong>: Hi, Bobby. It’s me. Just
wanted to see how you were doing–I guess you’re at the hospital now… I
hope your family’s doing good… Okay, I love you… Jumbo says hello
too…</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Your wire’s in here–we’re gonna follow the
signal. Find the stash house and make the deal, you leave the rest to
us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You gonna leave me all alone out
there?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: I ain’t gonna lie to you. There’s always a
risk.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Your cover’s blown, call for help– don’t try
and be a hero. Just get outta the way–place could turn into a butcher
shop. Talk about pussy–that’ll be our signal to come in early.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You come up with that one all by
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Just do the deal and get out. Bear in mind,
your life is in that lighter. Anything goes wrong, the department’ll get
word to your father.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: And oh–G.Q. told me to tell you– your
brother’s coming along real good. They reset his jaw and sometimes he’s
awake.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby–what’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I–I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I’m coming home in a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I–I’m gonna inform. For the police.</p>
<p>****: I’m gonna help `em set up Nezhinski.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I had to do it, Rosario. These
motherfuckers–they were gonna come after my father.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: But Nezhinski finds out, he’d kill</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: He ain’t ever gonna find out. He ain’t
ever gonna know.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: But what if something goes wrong?
What’s gonna happen to you?!?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I don’t know… I’d, I’d probably have to
go into protection.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: But that’s never gonna happen!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: How could you not even talk to me
about it…?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Rosario, listen–I had to do it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I had to do it…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Everything’s gonna be all right… Don’t
worry, it’ll be all right…</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Bobkes! My brother! I been calling
you all week! Where you been?!? We missed you!!!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah… Sorry, buddy–I got some legal
shit to deal with, from the raid… But I ain’t forgot about you–I’ll be
back soon.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Yeah well, without you around I
hadda lower myself here by hangin’ out with Freddie!</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: Bobby, hey! Mr. Buzhayev’d love to see you,
I’m sure–want me to tell him you’re here?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: No, it’s okay–I’ll talk to him
later…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Where’s Vadim.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Oh, he don’t come in here no
more–</p>
<p>****: Well, I got fifty grand in here. And it don’t move `less I deal
with the man himself.</p>
<p>****: So you’re interested, I wanna see your stash, right now. No
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Be on the boardwalk in a hour…</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: And dude–this don’t shake out…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky’s voice</strong>: Dude! Hey, dude!</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Get in!</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Put your hands out, where I could
see `em.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You know me.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Shut your fuckin’ mouth and do
it!</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Turn at the light…</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky</strong>: Go left. Again.</p>
<p><strong>pavel lubyarsky’s voice</strong>: Let’s go. No one’s on
us.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski’s voice</strong>: You needed to come here
tonight…?</p>
<p><strong>a darkened hallway</strong>: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is
wearing a surgical mask–except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him with
eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: What’s the matter, ain’t Pavel good
enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That’s all the money I got. And I ain’t
gonna leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>slavic youth</strong>: It’s all there. Fifty grand.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: From my savings. From El Caribe and
Rasputin.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: That buys you three keys in
here.</p>
<p>****: With the crack on the street, it’s worth two hundred k. Maybe
more.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: All the shit I get here is at least
eighty-six percent pure. And we got a lot more comin’ in–a LOT more. In
a way nobody could ever trace.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: The whole city’ll be sucking our
glass soon–you’ll see. We push the Guineas out, the Domos’ll work for
us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You’re breathing heavy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I took a little taste.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You know, I seen fighters–they
breathe like that, means they get nervous.</p>
<p>****: You nervous?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m clean.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You wanna search me again, you go
`head. I just wanna make this deal and go home.</p>
<p><strong>wallet, some change, keys, a cigarette lighter,
matches.</strong>: He sifts through the items, lighting the lighter. It
fires. Bobby gets slightly edgy. Notices that the others congregate
around the objects from his pocket–all except for Pavel, who holds an
AK-47 trained on Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: You got both matches and a
lighter.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m gonna get pussy from this…</p>
<p>****: What you say…?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: this deal goes down, I’m, I’m gonna get
a lotta pussy…</p>
<p><strong>seems like we can literally hear the blood rushing
through</strong>: BOBBY’S HEAD NOW. Setting himself, Bobby looks around
the room–where’s that backup???–and: the camera SPEEDS PAST Pavel’s and
Vadim’s faces, to the other side of the room. It MOVES toward the
WINDOW:</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: He got a wire!</p>
<p>****: Kill this motherfucker, right now!</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Hands on your heads! On the floor!</p>
<p><strong>no one freezes. chaos. gunfire. pavel swings back
to</strong>: BOBBY, a TERRIFYING LOOK ON HIS FACE. But Bobby is ready,
and SHOVES THE LETTER OPENER INTO PAVEL’S NECK. BLOOD CASCADES DOWN THE
MAN’S CHEST. Pavel collapses on Bobby, still very much alive. His eyes
are popping, and he throws his hands around Bobby’s THROAT. VADIM
CHARGES INTO:</p>
<p><strong>bobby is caught in the middle. still struggling
with</strong>: PAVEL, this has become the madness of war. Pavel bleeds
profusely all over Bobby’s chest, and this is a fight to the death.</p>
<p><strong>at that moment</strong>: A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the top of
Pavel’s head clean off, spattering Bobby’s face with brain particulate.
Bobby is forced to get out from under… We</p>
<p><strong>radios</strong>: 1 0 - 1 3 ! 10-13! 10-13!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m with you! I’m with YOU!</p>
<p><strong>warrant unit officer</strong>: Halt! Police!</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: Hold it right there! Hands on your
head!</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Don’t shoot!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Where’s my goddamned kid?!?</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: He is a dead man…</p>
<p><strong>officers</strong>: Shut up! Get down!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>emergency services guy</strong>: He’s gonna be okay, Chief.
Clear out!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You guys go on a bust like this and
you don’t tell me about it? You think I’m born yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: I guess we do.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You’re a real comedian! He’s gonna
need to be in protection now!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’ll be all right, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Well, I guess I don’t have a say in
anything anymore. Anyway… You did it. You did it and it took real
balls.</p>
<p>****: But now you’re burnt–and we gotta get you someplace safe, keep
you under wraps for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I need you to get my girlfriend, Pop. I
need her to come with me.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: I’ll get them to take care of that.
Just go get yourself fixed up– that’s the most important thing.</p>
<p><strong>a local news channel</strong>: the STORY is about the BUST:
MAJOR NARCOTICS SEIZURE, 40 KILOS OF COCAINE. An OFFICER is KILLED; Two
PERPETRATORS KILLED. Four others wounded.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: Bobby, hi! Spiro Giavannis, Deputy
Commissioner. Glad to see you made it out here today!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah. They let me come–long as I
brought these guys with me.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: How’s the leg treating you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Good… It’s rehabbing good, for only
nine weeks.</p>
<p>****: Don’t matter, I wasn’t no Fred Astaire before.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Anyway, it ain’t nothing compared to my
brother, so…</p>
<p><strong>fat lady</strong>: Everybody, they’ll be here any minute!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby, I’m gonna go outside for a
minute, have a smoke–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Just hold on, `til he gets here.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: You got any idea what you’re gonna
be doing after the trial?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m not sure yet… We been thinking
about moving down to Miami. Guy I used to work for, his brother’s got a
place down there.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: Gee, that’s great. Well listen, you
need any help, you give us a call. `Cause we can be part of your family
too.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: A lotta kids here, lotta family… It’s
nice, ain’t it…?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You know how happy I am you’re with
me?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>random woman</strong>: Here they are!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: `Be right back…</p>
<p><strong>entering the house</strong>: JOSEPH and Sandra, his wife. Joe
holds two bags–one filled with cards and memorabilia, the other with
clothes. What seems like a ZILLION PEOPLE are here when he walks in.
Everyone CHEERS. BURT moves right behind him, all smiles. Joseph is
thrilled–but somehow not the same. His face doesn’t look bad, but one
eye is a different color from the other, and he’s had reconstructive
surgery on his jaw. There is, of course, a scar, and he’s lost a lot of
weight.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Wow, fella! You look great!</p>
<p>****: Your eye–does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Only when I look at you!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Hey, Bobby…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m real glad you’re home…</p>
<p><strong>sandra grusinsky</strong>: Everyone, let’s, let’s move
inside– there’s plenty to eat!</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Joseph–we got some things we need to
discuss, when you get the chance.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: We could do it now if you want,
Pop. In the den.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby, I’m gonna go back to the
motel.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What’re you talking about? They got a
lot of food over there–why don’t you go eat something?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: N–I’m gonna go back.</p>
<p>****: You fucked up?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Bobby–you should hear this too, for
the trial.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: We gotta straighten this out later.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Nezhinski’s cache was huge, about 40
keys–yayo, some angel dust too.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: We’re gonna try and turn him, get
him to tell us how they’re bringing it in. But don’t worry–we’ll make
sure he does plenty of time.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: He ain’t gonna be reliable,
Pop.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Well, you marry an ape, you don’t
complain about the stench of bananas.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: He’s at Rikers. Tucked in, nice and
comfy. We’re taking him to the A.D.A. next week, for a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: I wanna go with you on that. See
his fuckin’ face.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: I’ll tell you, though–streets’re dead.
Junkies’re waitin’ out there for something big, no question.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: That’s `cause we got their number
one. Dried it up at the source.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That don’t mean nothing.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: What’s that, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: There’s a whole network full of
suppliers. The organization goes deep.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Bobby–you done a lot for us
already. You don’t gotta get involved in this anymore. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: I asked him to come in, Joe. If he’s
gonna have to testify, he should know all this.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: This’s police business, Pop–you
gonna make him an honorary member of the Force now?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’ll be outside if you need me.</p>
<p>****: What was said in there, he–he didn’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Well, why’s he goin’ back to work so
soon, anyway? He ain’t ready.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: No–it’s better this way. I don’t
want him sitting around with nothing to do, feeling useless–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Hey, c’mere. A lotta people been
talking. About how good you did.</p>
<p>****: And I think maybe…considering the alternatives…</p>
<p>****: …maybe you might wanna think about joining the Department.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: I could pull some strings, get you
through the academy with an early</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: No, come on! I don’t want that!</p>
<p>****: What I did, I did for you guys, this once. I got my own
plans.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Wait–Don’t go yet–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Take me back to the motel.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Can’t you put some clothes on
him?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Rosario? Rosario!</p>
<p><strong>dance floor. music: grandmaster flash’s “white
lines”.</strong>: ROSARIO DIAZ is in the center of the crowded floor,
dancing up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many
would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and stoned, and her
gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free. As she moves, she pushes the
men away with a smile. All, of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a
CAN CAN with two amused girls. Though fat, he’s surprisingly
graceful.</p>
<p><strong>all of a sudden</strong>: COMING THROUGH THE CROWD: BOBBY.
When Louis sees his friend, he lights up. Bobby’s furious inside, but
strangely calm outside:</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Bobkes!!!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: C’mon, honey–let’s dance!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: The cops’re right outside–let’s go. I
said, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: You don’t gotta yell at me, Bobby.</p>
<p>****: … was just trying to have a little fun for once, that’s
all…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Lou–no more of this for her. It’s too
fuckin’ dangerous now.</p>
<p>****: Sure, Bobkes. I mean, she come here.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Wait! Lemme get my coat at least!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: You know Bob, everyone’s been askin’
`bout you. We was all real surprised to hear about your family- -I mean,
your father’s like J. Edgar Hoover–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah–we’ll talk later, buddy–I’ll call
you. But right now I need to get her outta here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You gotta put everything in jeopardy?
Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: No! I was just dancing! I didn’t say
nothing!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You know, I don’t think you realize how
serious this is?</p>
<p>****: We gotta ride this out,
<code>til this fuckin' thing is over.</code>Til I can get things back on
track.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby, what do you want from me? I
can’t go out, I can’t do nothing– it’s like I’m in a jail–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I know. But I’m workin’ on it, I am.
Soon as the trial’s over and I get my money back outta impound–
everything’ll get better, you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: It’s just, I feel…I feel like it’s
just you and all those cops all the time. And they look at me like I’m a
piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Rosario–once this’s done, we’ll go down
to Miami… be a new thing for us–a lotta opportunities…</p>
<p>****: I’ll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about working for his brother down
there. We’ll get your mother to come too– I’ll even talk to Jumbo about
it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: C’mon… Let’s go back–this’ll all be
over soon. I promise…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: I’ll go in the lead car. You stay
with him `til we get to the A.D.A.’s.</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: You got it…</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: We heard all about you in the news.
We were all very sorry about your brother.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Thank you… You know Mr. Buzhayev, I
come to see you today `cause…with everything that’s gone on, I don’t
think it’s a good idea for me to stay in New York anymore. I was hoping
maybe you could ask your brother if I could work with him, down in
Miami. On his restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: I could talk to him. I think he
would like you very much.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’d appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: We’re going to be very sad if you’re
going. Having you here in this house meant a lot to us. You know, my
wife and me, we have only daughters.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You always been very important to me
too. I should probably go now.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Bobby–you’ll always be welcome back
here.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: They did good. On his face.</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: Shut your fuckin’ mouth.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: He makes a deal today, maybe my
brother don’t gotta take the stand… Least that’s something…</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: Give me that lighter.</p>
<p><strong>passenger’s seat flies right through the front
windshield.</strong>: He’s probably killed.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Stop the fuckin’ car!</p>
<p><strong>another car pulls in between them. automatic weapons
fire</strong>: immediately pins Joseph and the other two police inside
the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Hello? What’s the matter? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Jesus! Listen to me–you and Jack get
someplace safe. Let ESU take care of it–I’m gonna go get your
brother.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: You know, my Aunt’s in Miami. We
probably could stay with her for a little bit `til we get settled.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah, maybe. Why don’t we give `em all
these bags to throw out–it’s becoming a mess.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Nezhinski’s out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What–?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Your brother was taking him to the
A.D.A. and they got ambushed. They hit three of our guys.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Jesus… What about–</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Your brother’s fine. We gotta get
you moved–you’ve been here too long.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: You need to pack up.</p>
<p><strong>vitt the guard</strong>: Chief, we got three vehicles coming
around the corner. Backup’s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You see something out there?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Nah, we’re good. It’s just, I just
realized–I know this neighborhood. I used to come with my father, to
work on the plumbing, for the houses–brought me along to do the talking.
He only spoke Russian his whole life…</p>
<p>****: Anyway, it’s all changed now.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: One more minute, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Arright…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop? Joe come close this morning?</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: I don’t know… I heard he did good,
though. You know, with everything that’s happened–who knows? Maybe all
this’ll bring us closer together someday.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Once this is over, you and your
brother, you’ll talk, you’ll work things out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah, maybe. But you know the way he
is.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Bobby–your brother, I think he
probably feels a little guilty, with everything you did, with you in
protection now… But he appreciates what you’ve done–I know he does.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Look, I’m just trying to keep us
together here, that’s all. That’s all I want.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I know, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>burt grusinsky</strong>: Okay… We’ll move `em to Corona. I’ll
lead the line.</p>
<p><strong>three cars</strong>: Burt in one, heading the route. Behind
him is Bobby and Rosario’s car, with guard Vitt behind the wheel and the
two of them in the back seat. A third car has TWO OFFICERS in it. That
vehicle trails the other two. The</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It’s really coming down…</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby–I think I left my watch at the
hotel–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Hey–Vitt–I think somethin’s on our
right!</p>
<p>****: Huh–?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>revealing: burt’s car and the oldsmobile hitting
each</strong>: OTHER, SIDE TO SIDE; THEN, A HUBCAP–we don’t know from
which car it’s been dislodged…</p>
<p><strong>comes spinning at incredible speed. at bobby’s
windshield.</strong>: Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby
swerves. THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes up
against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that protects him from
spinning off into the river, two hundred feet below.</p>
<p><strong>burt’s voice</strong>: They got a hit on! Get support,
now!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Rosario! You hurt?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop, lay back!</p>
<p><strong>burt’s voice</strong>: I got him! I got the sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>and then, close shot on bobby: three quick cuts, closer
and</strong>: CLOSER…SILENCE… He sees, through the rain: a LONG SHOTGUN
BARREL come out of the window from the rear passenger’s seat area.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Don’t fuckin’ look at him! I said
don’t–back up! Don’t look at him…</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby? Could I call my mother…?</p>

the arrangements for tomorrow’s service–?</p>
<p>****: That’s right…</p>

<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Bobby… I’m real glad you’re with
me now…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Course…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: You know, I was…I was jealous of
you, long time.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: …I always did what Pop wanted. And
you were free…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: No…. I did it to hurt him… I
disappointed him…</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: Gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>simultaneous</strong>: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN,
grows more distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him and

right…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I can’t live like this no more, Mike…
They destroyed my family.</p>

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I, I could join you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: My Pop tol’ me you pull guys outta the
Academy, guys with special knowledge, make `em cops? You could do
that.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Bobby, come on–you got your own life
to live–</p>
<p>****: No. I can’t do nothing else now.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Then you gotta understand–this ain’t
something you do just for a vendetta. You gotta go back to the Academy
when you’re done, you gotta commit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Gimme a couple days–I’ll talk to the
P.C.</p>

days…</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby, I don’t know if I can be here
no more.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What’re you talking about? I just got
through telling you–</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: No, I think maybe it’s time I leave
then–go down to Miami on my own, with my mother.</p>
<p>****: I can’t let you do that. That ain’t safe for you.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: You know that’s not true, Bobby.
They’re not after me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Hold on a second–I know what I’m
talking about’d be a change.</p>
<p>****: It’d be a big change for us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: But we could make a life here. This’d
be something we could build on. We could raise a family, and…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pretty soon you’d fit in.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: No I wouldn’t…</p>
<p>****: They know what I was–what I was</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: They’ll accept you if we’re</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: I gave it all up for you and you
changed everything!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Gave it up? Gave up what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What fuckin’ life did you have? You’re
a fuckin’ cokehead–look at you!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: And you were clean, Bobby? We were</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Well, maybe I was a piece of shit too!
Wasting my goddamned time!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: How could you say that…? We had</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Wake up! All that was nothing!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: No! Now is nothing! Look at what’s
happened to your family, Bobby–your father, he’s dead–look at your
brother! It could all happen to you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: My brother’s gonna be all right– and
nothing’s gonna happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: That’s what you said before.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Hey–where you goin’–</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Get off me! Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What the fuck you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>rosario diaz</strong>: Get off me–I don’t want it! It’s not
what I want!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: All right. Why don’t you just calm down
and think about it a little.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You think about it, you’ll feel
different. You’ll understand. And in time, we’ll look back on all this
and you’ll see I was right. Look–I love you.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you go get some rest?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: We appreciate your patience, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>spiro giavannis</strong>: The Commissioner is here now, and
he’s ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>commissioner ruddy</strong>: We’re all very sorry about your
father–he was a great man.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Thank you, sir. I’m gonna try and do my
part too, now.</p>
<p><strong>commissioner ruddy</strong>: Good. Raise your right hand.</p>

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: “–that I will support and defend the
Constitution, both of the United States government and the State of New
York, to the best of my ability…”</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: “…I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of rider in the New York City Police Department. So help me
God.”</p>
<p><strong>commissioner william ruddy</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: …But we got our guys out there,
working the street all over? I mean, they coupeing or they working?</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: Everybody’s out there, bustin’ balls,
left and right! What else you want us to do?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed officer</strong>: Bobby, a Rosario Diaz’s been
callin’ for you. She says she needs to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Thanks. I’ll call her back.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Well, you tell Narcotics Queens we got
an A-1 sale hanging over our head and either they help us or we fuckin’
take it out on `em later!</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: What about Nezhinski’s uncle? That
clubowner–Marat Buzhayev?</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: Clean. We tailed him for weeks. Goes
out with his grandkids, takes
<code>em horseriding at Floyd Bennett Field... Checks on his fur business from time to time--we even looked at some of the coats and tore</code>em
apart. Turned out to be fake sable, if you could believe it.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: It’s comin’ up quick, we don’t
know anything… We’re gonna lose it…</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Joe–this is still new territory for
all of us. I mean, we hadda use your brother here to get any results to
begin with.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: I know that. And my family takes
the hit–my family…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Could you guys go outside for a minute?
I wanna talk to my brother.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You’re trying to do everything– it’s
gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: We don’t got much time…we lose
Nezhinski, we’re both dead… streets’ll get flooded, the whole City’s
gonna be on fire–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: We could handle it. I mean, I come on
to help you–</p>
<p>****: Well, I didn’t ask you to do that. I don’t need your help–I
could deal with it on my own.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I know. But you don’t gotta do
everything yourself. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Joe, what’s wrong? Come on, you can
tell me.</p>
<p>****: A deal this big, something’s gonna come up. You’ll
see–someone’ll fold.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: It’s not that. It’s just… You give
up what you wanted to do to be here, Bobby. And part of me feels a
little responsible.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Nah, you didn’t do nothing. It’s meant
to be. You can’t fuckin’ control it…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: You know, I remember when Pop was
mad at you, he always used to say you didn’t believe in our family. And
Mom, she’d protect you. She’d give you those little caramels… Anyway, I
knew he was wrong too, but I didn’t say nothing.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed officer</strong>: Bobby, Rosario Diaz just called
again.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Tell her I’m on my way back now. Don’t
worry.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: That’s all in the past. I’ll see you
later.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: What happened–where’d she go?!?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: She left about an hour ago. She said to give
you this–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: We gotta go find her!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: She asked us not to, Bobby. She’s– Bobby–we
can’t do that legally!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Go `head! Keep me in here–KEEP ME</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: Bobby, we don’t wanna have to put you
in restraints, so just calm down!</p>
<p>****: Calm the fuck down!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You gonna keep me here? HUH?!?</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It’s me, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: HEY!!!! Bobkes!!! How you

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m okay. Listen uh, you ain’t spoke to
Rosario lately, have you?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: No. She’s holed up with you, ain’t

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah–it’s just, she must’ve gone out
for a little bit and…I wanted to get in touch with her.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Well, I talk to her, I’ll tell her

<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: My brother! The Grand Return!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: You ain’t heard from Rosario

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: You want Hazel here to fix you up
with a little something? I’m only kiddin’–let’s have a drink– Hey
Natasha, over there!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Why don’t you slow down a little? You’re
already acting stupid!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: And you’re already acting like a
pain in my ass! I can hold my liquor and yours!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Jumbo, I don’t want nothing right
now–don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Good evening. My name is Marat
Buzhayev, and I’m the owner of the El Caribe. We have a special night,

<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Okay, Eli. Tell him I’ll come up.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Bob, you all right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Rosario–Rosario’s gone down to Florida
for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Florida?</p>
<p>****: Well, she probably just needed a little time for herself.
She’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Yeah… You know, I was just thinking
`bout when I first met her here… Working back there…</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Ah, don’t worry, Bob. I have no
doubt she’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: I mean, between you and me, that
place they had you in was drivin’ her crazy. The Kew Motor Inn–we used
to call that the SCREW Motor Inn, with all the hookers… Get that
waitress wouldja?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Louis–? How’d you know where I was
staying?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: How’d you know where I was staying?</p>
<p>****: It was, it was in the papers…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: It wasn’t in no papers, Louis. Don’t
make me embarrass you. Let’s go outside, right now.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Where’s Nezhinski?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: I don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Don’t play games with me, Louis.</p>

part of my life is dead. Today it ended for good…</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Bobby I swear–I don’t know
nothing!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You know my father is dead because of
you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You know I’m on the Force now? And I
could do anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: No, wait! Bob, please! Don’t do this
to me… Don’t do this to me Bob, please…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You tell me what you know right now or
I swear to Christ I will make you disappear.</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: Bobby, I… I told
<code>em where you were--but, but it ain't what you think! I was makin' a buy and these guys in hoods, they held a gun to my head--so I tried to give</code>em
the wrong information!</p>
<p><strong>louis falsetti</strong>: No, wait, listen! It’s true! Rosario
tol’ me you moved every couple days, she said you was gonna move–I
thought you’d be gone by then! It’s the truth, Bobby! I would never try
and hurt you! Never, swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You tell me, right now–</p>
<p>****: Where’s your fuckin’ spot?!?</p>
<p><strong>african-american man</strong>: I got your money man, but my
shit’s running low. When you get me more?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Just hold on a little while longer– we
get more for you soon.</p>
<p><strong>african-american man</strong>: Yeah? When’s that gonna

<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>eli mirichenko</strong>: After tomorrow, everybody’s gonna
get well.</p>
<p><strong>cop’s voice</strong>: We got your boy Eli completely covered,
Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>tough-looking cop</strong>: He just turned in for the
night.</p>
<p>****: Can’t move an inch without us up his ass.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Well, he said tomorrow and that’s what
matters.</p>
<p><strong>tough-looking cop</strong>: And we’ll be right there with
him– you can be sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: They’re movin’ serious weight, we
might be talkin’ major league firepower. Maybe we call in the Feds.</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: The Feds?</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Each one of `em’s got 25 years on the
job with this kinda thing, Pudge.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: They got one year of experience,
repeated 25 times.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Pop would never bring `em in, Joe. We
gotta see this through ourselves…</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: Bobby’s right.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Yeah, definitely… We’ll get the
TAC plan together…</p>
<p>****: And wherever it is, we’ll be ready for `em…</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Arright, guys. That’s it for now.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: You know, they’re laughin’ at us, out
there on the street. Now when we get there, it’ll be up to you what we
do. But I hope you think about droppin’ the hammer on `em.</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: I mean–after your father and
everything? These people’re like fuckin’ lice.</p>
<p>****: Just think about what I’m saying to you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: All right, c’mon. Enough…</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: We’re gonna get all of `em today.</p>
<p><strong>emerging</strong>: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him,
Eli, helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other. They KISS
WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the devastation. Almost to
himself:</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Lookit the two of them…they’re so
fuckin’ close…</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Okay–when they complete the sale,
that’s when we move. ESU’ll grab the kids.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: This’s what we’ve been planning for
for so long. My nephew has stayed just to see this through.</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: When this is done, we’ll control
almost the whole market. Each load is completely untraceable. It’s my
own method.</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: The rest of the product is in the
van–total weight, 75 kilos.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: The deal’s closing–let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You’re surrounded by the police! Come
out now, with your hands on your heads!</p>
<p><strong>all of a sudden</strong>: A COP, that TOUGH-LOOKING COP we
saw at Joseph’s house but a few moments earlier, is HIT by the Armed
Guard’s fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near Joseph and Bobby.
DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Joe?!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Arright, just stay down!</p>
<p><strong>vadim scurries into the weeds… the small structure</strong>:
REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: Stop! Halt!</p>
<p><strong>bobby’s heartbeat thumps on the soundtrack… a man</strong>:
backing up toward him; each man has his back to the other…</p>
<p><strong>into bobby, with the figure behind him. bobby sees
the</strong>: SHADOW ON THE GROUND. He turns, SLOWLY…raises his weapon,
about to FIRE when he realizes:</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: This’s too dangerous. We’ll all wind
up killing each other–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Vadim is in here with us. Radio our
guys, tell `em to get into the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Bobby! We got the old man!</p>
<p><strong>jack shapiro</strong>: We got the old man–Buzhayev. Up by the
cars. His grandkids are safe–they’re in the van.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Are all our guys out?</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Burn it.</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: Bobby? What’re you doin’–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I’m not gonna let him get away…</p>
<p><strong>vadim nezhinski</strong>: Don’t…don’t let me die in here…</p>
<p><strong>bobby emerges from the fire… he walks toward the
police</strong>: CARS. THE POLICE ARE ASSEMBLED around: MARAT BUZHAYEV.
BOBBY WATCHES HIM FOR A MOMENT, HIS FACE filled with</p>
<p><strong>marat buzhayev</strong>: Bobby–I, I didn’t know it would be
your family–</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Get down! On the ground!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Put him in the fuckin’ van… Don’t touch
him…</p>
<p><strong>he sees</strong>: Joseph inside one of them, still. Staring
at him. WE DOLLY WITH HIM as he moves to his brother. CROUCHES DOWN,
stays by JOSEPH…</p>
<p><strong>random officers</strong>: Bobby! Hey! Lookit you–six months
in the Academy and already you look like a chief!</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Hey everybody…</p>
<p><strong>michael solo</strong>: I just saw the commissioner. A lotta
people’re gonna wanna talk to you–important people. About maybe settin’
you up with your own unit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: All right. We’ll talk about that
after.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: They’re getting started–we should
probably go in now.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: You know, I think Pop would be
real happy to see you like this.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: I don’t think he’d believe it… But I
guess things don’t always go the way you think they will.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Ah, the Force’ll treat you good.
I’m sure you do very well.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: You definitely gonna leave? Ain’t no
way you change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: It’s the right thing. It’s over
for me–I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Listen, we’ll spend some more time
together from now on. Okay? I’ll come over next week.</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: Arright, yeah. Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>bobby green</strong>: Chaplain? I’d like you to introduce me
this way. If you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>police chaplain</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen: we shall
begin today’s ceremony with the traditional invocation, moving then to
the valedictorian address to be given by…Robert Grusinsky. Son of the
late Deputy Chief Albert Grusinsky, brother of Captain Joseph
Grusinsky.</p>
<p><strong>police chaplain</strong>: You know, as I look at this fine
young man seated here, I can’t help but think about all the young
members of our department. I get filled with such pride.</p>
<p>****: Men like him are the great future of our Force…</p>
<p><strong>joseph grusinsky</strong>: I love you, Bobby.</p>
