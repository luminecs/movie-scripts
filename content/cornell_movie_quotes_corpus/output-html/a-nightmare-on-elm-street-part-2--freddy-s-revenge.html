<p><strong>mom</strong>: I know it’s warm… I wish you’d call someone to

<p><strong>dad</strong>: I know what’s wrong with the air coditioning -
just needs a shot of freon, is all.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Dad’s fixin’ something again. Hit the
deck!</p>

<p><strong>jesse</strong>: your timing was perfect - I was getting the
third degree in there.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ah, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Aren’t you afraid somebody could steal your
car like that?</p>

<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>schneider</strong>: Well, pay attention, next time!</p>

<p><strong>schneider</strong>: Okay boys, assume the position!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: ’Night Coach.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: How much longer you figure he’ll keep us out

<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: So, what about you and that Poletti girl?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You two got a thing going, or what?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: She’s a neighbor, I drive her to school.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She giving you any carfare for the ride?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You got a problem with me, Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Naw. Just killing time.</p>
<p><strong>schneider</strong>: Okay boys, hit the showers.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: So, you live around here.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Not too far. My folks bought a place over on
Elm Street.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Elm Street? You telling me you moved in to
that big white house with the bars on the windows?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah, why?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shit, you can tell your old man he’s a real
chump.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: They’ve only been trying to unload that dump
for five years. That place is bad news. Some chick was locked in there
by her mother and she went crazy. She watched her boyfriend get
butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor
drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hi! You didn’t have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s okay, I wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah, yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Let me look at your eye…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You shouldn’t be fighting with that jerk.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Who, Grady? Grady’s alright, he’s just a
hothead.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You mean a shithead.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Grady?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It better be you, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: DAD!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Daddy can’t help you now.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’ve been waiting five years for you, Jesse.
We got special work to do, you and me. Things are really gonna heat
up.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: We’ll do real good together, you and me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You got the body… I got the brains.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Maybe we should call a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Really. Just a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>mr. able</strong>: So, to review, the solid waste, those
nutrients that are not absorbed in the lining of the stomach, the large
intestine, the small intestine - the alimentary canal - are passed out
through the colon…</p>
<p><strong>mr. able</strong>: The liquid nutrients are then carried
through an elaborate system of filtering, aided by the pancreas, liver
and gall bladder…</p>
<p><strong>mr. able</strong>: Or collected in the bladder to be expelled
at a later time. And this entire process is kept moving through “the
circulatory system”, the center of which is… …the heart.</p>
<p><strong>mr. able</strong>: …Four chambers, just like the human heart,
really.</p>
<p><strong>mr able</strong>: From the body, through the right auricle,
to the right ventricle and out the pulmonary artery to the lungs.</p>
<p><strong>mr. able</strong>: If you want to play with animals,
Mr. Walsh, join the circus.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Just out for a while.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I told you I want that room unpacked.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh, come on Dad…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: No. Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: There’s a Jesse on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Okay…thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesse, hi… Oh…that’s okay. Sorry you can’t
make it. No, I understand. Parents can be real pains…I’ll see you in the
morning, then…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I told her you invited me over. I guess I
should have called, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No, that’s okay. I was just…unpacking.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I figured you might like some help.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Where does this go?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: There’s a box of sweaters over there if you
want to put them up in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “Nancy Thompson, 1428 Elm…” Hey, this thing is
five years old.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Uh-uh. Before my time.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “February 17th - My birtday. Daddy came by
today with a big ol’ stuffed bear for me. He took me to dinner and a
movie and when we got back, he and Mother had another one of their
fights. He left angry. I wish they would stop fighting…”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I think it’s sad…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Traumas of a ten-year old.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him
again. I can’t yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I’m not
sure that I love him. I can’t sleep with someone I don’t love.”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That’s typical. I hope she didn’t expect to
make the best seller list with this thing.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Wow, listen to this! “Sometimes, when I’m
lying here in bed, I can see Glen, in his window across the way, getting
ready for bed. His body is slim and smooth and I know I shouldn’t watch
but that part of me that wants him forces me to. That’s when I weaken.
That’s when I want to go to him…”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That’s it? Wait, she skipped a week. “March
15 - he comes to me at night. Horrible. Ugly. Dirty. Under the sheets
with me, tearing at my night- gown with his steel claw…”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: “His name is Fred and he keeps taking me to
the boiler room. He wants to kill me.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “Tina is dead.”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: “Rod’s been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen
and me now. Can’t fall asleep!”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Are you okay.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Something Grady told me today about the
people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed
in the house across the street…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Looks great! Thought you might want to take a
break - got some cold cider downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No…thanks. I better get back. Got a major
paper due the end of this week.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well, it’s there if you change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: World History. But, I’ll see you in the
morning, right?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hot stuff. Let me know how it turns out.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll walk you downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: A little warm in here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Shhh…The birds are sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: It’s 97 degrees in here!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Get a broom or something!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Help me with this thing!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It’s not the gas, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Don’t tell me it’s not the gas!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Don’t tell me it’s not the gas! Your mother
thought she smelled gas.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I wasn’t sure, Ken…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That
cheap seed you’ve been buying?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, please…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What is it then? There’s got to be an
explanation. Animals just don’t burst into flames for no reason!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well it sure isn’t leaky gas pipes.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ken!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You set this all up, didn’t you? One of your
sick jokes?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You know what I’m talking about. What did you
use, a fire cracker? A cherry bomb?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t have to listen to this!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ken!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I don’t know…I don’t know, Shirl. He used to be
a good kid.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Hot enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Go ahead, Jesse. Try it on for size!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I need you to finish my work. Let me teach
you, Jesse. We’ll have fun. You like my little trick with the bird?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Kill for me. c’mon Jesse. Come to
Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Why did it take them five years to sell this
house, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I don’t know. COuldn’t get the right price, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And you don’t know anything about a murder
across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole
thing?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I don’t know. They told me something about it,
yeah. What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Oh, come on, Shirl, how’d you think we got such
a good deal? Listen - all old houses have stories.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Did they tell you she went totally out of her
mind - that they had to put her away? And that her mother killed herself
in our living room?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Mommy, I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Shhhhh. Jesse and Daddy are just making
believe, sweetheart. I don’t think we should be talking about this
now.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You see what you’re doing? Now I don’t want to
hear another word about it. There’s nothing wrong with this house!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Something burning?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Craziest damn thing I ever saw - wasn’t even
plugged in.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This is amazing! Your dream told you where
this was?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Only it was more like, you know, sleep-
walking. All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Forget about going back to sleep after that.
I was up all night. I finished reading this. It gets real crazy towards
the end, after all the death stuff. But then she said some- thing really
freaky - about her mother taking her down to the basement to show her
the glove.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That’s when she started talking about Fred
Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Fred Krueger. The guy in her dream who’s
coming to kill her. Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went
around kidnapping kids and killing them.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Maybe you were having a premonition or
something. You know, like those guys who help the police solve crimes
and find missing people. You ever had anything like this happen
before?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No. Never. You think that’s what it is?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Can I look at that diary for a little
while?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hi, Kerry.</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks. Any
cute guys gonna be there?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: All of them.</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: Yor dad picking the music again?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Mom’s trying to keep him upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Last party I had, Dad insisted on playing
nothing but Benny Goodman records all night.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll see you later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I may be late. Baseball practice!</p>
<p><strong>a teamate</strong>: Last out. Up to you, Walsh.</p>
<p><strong>schneider</strong>: Strike!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Good game, Walsh…Way to go, Walsh …etc.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It was okay.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Who told you to choke up that way?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: My Dad. He played in the minors for a while,
when he got out of college.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Schneider shouldn’t have called you out on
that double.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yeah, well, Schneider’s got a stick up his
ass today.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Schneider’s always got a stick up his
ass.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You remember your dreams, Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Only the wet ones.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Sorry. Schneider id it to me again.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I just got here myself. Went to the Public
Library. Cut four classes!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What’s all this.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Research. Hi. C’mon, let’s go for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m convinced you’ve had a genuine psychic
vision.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: At first I wasn’t sure because you said that
you never had anyting like last night happen before. But I found out
that most people have the potential for tuning in to “the other world”
and neve do. It has something to do with the environment - like they
have to be in a place that’s sending signals.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Like a haunted house, right? I don’t believe
in ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You don’t have to. You just have to believe in
energy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Look, you got electricity in your body,
right?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah, I know…synapses neurong…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it
all go when you die?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t know - into the air I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Make a left at this corner.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What about “essential energy” the soul. Does
that go into the air too? You think there’s a good energy and a bab
energy?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t know. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she
kept finding herself in a boiler room? Fred Krueger worked here. It’s an
old power- plant - a steam generator!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I did some reading up on our friend, Fred

SPRINGWOOD:SLASHER DIES IN HELLISH INFERNO”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He kidnapped twenty kids and brought them all
here to die.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: So, you feeling anything?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I thought you might be able to make a
connection.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Any ghosts in here?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: C’mon, cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I don’t know. Concentrate or some- thing.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I feel like a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Shhh. Just concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Uh-uh. Wait…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Disappointed?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: About not finding any bogey men?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll get over it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You are sensitive. I mean you sensed that the
rat was there. And I can feel something about you. Sometimes I feel like
I know what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Maybe it only happens when you’re sleeping -
that’s the way it was with Nancy, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Now, there’s an idea we can take off on.
Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of
blankets and… Until I fall asleep.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Maybe we can do that. Strictly scientific, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You
wouldn’t be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential
lunatic?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Ghostbusters are fearless.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What is it - What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t know - a sharp pain.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It’s gone now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, Jesse…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesse, this is no good. You’ve got to get some
sleep, Jesse. You’ve got to get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: One, two, Freddy’s coming for you.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Three, four, better lock your door.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Five, six, grab your crucifix…</p>
<p><strong>schneider</strong>: Hit the showers.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No…Oh God, no…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Okay, we’re gonna put our cards on the table,
here and now. There’s not going to be any retribution - no fire and
brimstone. I only have two questions and you’ll answer them and we’ll
all go to bed, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Okay. What are you taking and who are you
getting it from?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m not taking drugs, Dad. Can I go to bed
now?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Sure…go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: He’s on something.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Jesse, please, let’s talk about this!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m okay. Just leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He needs professional help. I think we should
take him to a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Are you nuts or something? What the hell is
that going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I don’t know! I just know he needs help and we
don’t know how to give it to him.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Don’t fight me on this.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: He needs a kick in the but, is what he needs.
He needs a methodone clinic!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, blow it out your ass, Ken.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Will you stop and tell me what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m fine. Nothing’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: you didn’t say more than two words to me the
whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: yeah, I had a bad night.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: My Dad thinks I’m on drugs, my Mom thinks I’m
crazy and I’m not sure I don’t agree with her.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Okay gang, let’s move along.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Holy shit, man. Where have you been? Fuckin’
Schneider got wasted last night.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh Jesus. I’m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He must’ve been working late and some
fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa. In the shower! Left
bloody footprints all over the…</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: That was something this morning, huh? About
Schneider, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: Jesse sure took it bad, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Look, I’m sorry about Schneider, man. I
didn’t know you were so close.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You want to go out to a movie or something
tonight? Get your mind off things?</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: Hi, guys. Hi, Ronny. You going to Lisa’s
party tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I can’t. I’m grounded.</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: For throwin’ my grandmother down a flight of
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You should eat something - you’ll feel
better.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I wish you’d talk to me. We can figure it out,
you know. We can figure it out together.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: There’s nothing to figure out.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You’re wasting your time, the guy’s a basket
case.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Shut up, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You want me to shut up? Fine, I’ll shut up,
that’s fine. See you around, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: Bought some nice strawberries at the
farm today. We can have some short cake for your friends tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: I also wangled a promise out of your
father.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: We’re gonna stay out of your way
tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re going out?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: We’re going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: Early.</p>
<p><strong>intruder</strong>: Wake up, little girl…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It’s late…go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How’d you sleep, honey, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You’re looking a little better today.</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: Hey, watch it there!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: We’re going up to bed now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thanks, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: Twelve-thiry, Miss. No later.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Twelve-thirty. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: And don’t forget to lock the gate.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Goodnight, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think I better go. I’m just not into it
tonight. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why won’t you talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Will you leave me alone? Please.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re not being fair to me. I’m worried about
you and I want to help you get through this thing.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What are you gonna do? How are you gonna
help? I’m losing my mind. I don’t want to have you watch me fall
apart.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s okay, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m afraid to go to sleep, I’m afraid to stay
awake - I’m ruining your party. They’re gonna put me away for sure.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We’ll figure it out together. We’ll stay up
all night if we have to. I won’t let anything happen to you.</p>
<p><strong>boy one</strong>: Any second, now…</p>
<p><strong>boy one</strong>: Party time.</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: Oh, wow, Van Halen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: Let them have their fun, Honey.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of
me!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You gotta let me stay here tonight,
Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Are you nuts or something?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Listen to me, Grady, this is serious.
Something really weird is happening. It started out like just bad dreams
but it’s getting real bad.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Aw, will you get out of here! Go and take a
sleeping pill or something…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: In fact, take a whole bottle and do the world
a favor.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I killed Schneider, Grady…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Only it wasn’t me - I was there but it was
like something inside of me, moving me around. Then last night it made
me go into my sister’s room and tonight, with Lisa in the cabana. We
were…on the floor - I felt it happening again.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It wanted me to kill them, Grady!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You’re fucked in the head.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m scared, Grady. I know it sounds crazy.
But, there’s something trying to get into my body.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: The only thing trying to get into your body
is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor. And you want to sleep
with me. Go figure.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Look, I don’t care if you believe me or
not…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I believe you. You had some scary dreams,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No! I don’t know - everything’s all mixed up.
What difference does it make? I’m in trouble here. I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Okay, schmuck. What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Just watch me. If anything weird happens -
like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try
to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don’t
let me leave.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And Grady…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Don’t fall asleep!</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Why don’t you just call him?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He won’t talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Well, you’re not doing him or yourself any
good sitting here and worrying.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I shoud go see him, but…I don’t know, the
party and all…</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Go ahead. I’ll hold down the fort.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thanks, Patty. You’re a pal.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sweet dreams, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It’s happening again.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>mr. grady</strong>: What’s going on? Open the door,
Ronny!</p>
<p><strong>mr. grady</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No! No! No! No! You son of a bitch! You
killed him!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesse, God - what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I killed him! I killed him!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, Christ, you’re hurt…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I killed Grady. I killed Grady, Lisa. I
killed Schneider. Oh my God, he’s inside me…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Who, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: he’s just waiting to take me. When I
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Who? Who’s doing this to you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Fred Krueger. He’s been trying to get hold of
me, to use me. He needs me to get out of his world into ours…He’s gonna
take me again.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No, Jesse. This isn’t happening. It’s gotta be
everything you’ve taken in – Schneider and the diary and the glove –
only it’s all mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No! Christ, how can I make you understand? He
tried to make me kill Angela last night! Look at the blood on my
hands!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh, God. I did that to Grady… He owns me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m not gonna let anyone take you from me.
There’s got to be a reason. We’ll figure it out together.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Wait in here for me. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: Hey, look!</p>
<p><strong>bar-b-que</strong>: Holy Shit!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Something Nancy said - her last entry. “He is
evil itself. I know now that I brought him into my world. We all did,
gave him all the energy he needed. Our screams were all he needed. Now I
will take it back - Deny him.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She wasn’t crazy. All this really happened.
You can fight him.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Remember what I said? About good energy and
bad energy? He thrives on bad energy. Hate, anger, fear. He is bad
energy. You’ve been afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh, God, he’s coming back! Get out of here,
Lisa!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Fight it, Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You created him - you can destroy him. He
lives off your fear. Fight him, Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: The lock’s jammed!</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: Hey, can somebody turn down the heater?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re not afraid of him! He doesn’t even
exist.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: He can’t fight me. I’m him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: Lisa!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesse, help!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m Jesse now, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Kill me! Please kill me!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Go agead, Lisa. Kill him! Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Lisa…Lisa…I love you…I love you!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Please, God…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Nooo…</p>
<p><strong>teens</strong>: What happened? Where’d he go. Etc.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He couldn’t do it, Momma.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: My God!</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: Get her out of here!</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: Get her out of here!</p>
<p><strong>do-gooder</strong>: Now calm down - we want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Help yourself, fucker.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You are all my children!</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mr. poletti</strong>: Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. poletti</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>mr poletti</strong>: Lisa!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Please work, please.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Had your chance. Die now!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Come to me, Lisa - I’m waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, God, Jesse - I know you’re there! Stop
him!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Jesse’s dead, Lisa. Freddy’s here.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wanna join your little friend?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Where’s Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: There is no Jesse. I’m Jesse now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I want him back. Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I love you, Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Come and get me, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m not afraid of you. You couldn’t kill
me…He’s in there and I want him back. I’m gonna take him away from you
and you’re going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Jesse’s dead! I sliced ’im real good!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Come back to me, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I love you, Jesse. Come back to me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: He’s dead, you bitch.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’ll kill you now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He can’t hold you Jesse. He’s losing his grip
- you can get out.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: He’ll die with me!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: He’ll die with both of us!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We must look like a couple of escapees from a
veterans’ hospital.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I can’t believe we actually –</p>
