<h1 id="man-on-fire">man-on-fire</h1>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in
the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost
children.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: The family paid the ransom and he was
returned two days later. His father still hasn’t gotten up the nerve to
ask him if they fucked him up the ass.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: And now every mother with money in Mexico
City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: If she pisses you off, you get another
one.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Do you know what she told me last night?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: A man’s worth can be judged by what he has or
what he owes. Only the amount matters.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in
the social strata?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m only asking for one thing. And it’s not an
extravagance. It’s not even for me; it’s for our daughter.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Our daughter.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Our child’s safety is at stake.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: These people are professionals. They don’t
waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually
bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Samuel, it is not something we should skimp
on. A bodyguard’s presence in the car or outside the school was at least
some form of deterrent. Now he’s gone, I feel totally exposed.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Of course I care about Pinta. She’ll be as
beautiful as her mother one day.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Yeah? And if she was ugly?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: All my clients have kidnap and ransom
insurance.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my
family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will
not be able to renew it.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like
that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I know! I just had to let one go because I
couldn’t afford him!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You need a bodyguard of some description.
It’s a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He
doesn’t need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: For a year?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You
have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for
incompetence. The important thing is Lisa’s daughter will return to
school.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: And Lisa will be able to save face. We won’t
be the only family without a bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Her beauty fucks with your mind.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: For an American she understands this country
very well.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: She understands men.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Italics denotes the lines spoken in
Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>customs</strong>: Where are you coming from?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: South America.</p>
<p><strong>customs</strong>: Where are you staying in Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m on to Juarez.</p>
<p><strong>customs</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I have a friend there.</p>
<p><strong>customs</strong>: I cannot see your eyes, Senor.</p>
<p><strong>customs</strong>: Senor?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s a permit to carry a gun in Columbia.
The gun you’re about to find in that suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Rayburn here.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: When did Mexican Customs start getting
smart?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: What do you mean, I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City
International. Bring a bunch of cash… about 5K. I’m going to need
it.</p>
<p><strong>int. customs area - a back office</strong>: Rayburn has 5K
U.S. dollars laid out on the desk between him, the Customs official, and
Creasy. The remains of the suitcase are spread around the room. The main
offender, the gun being front and center next to the cash. Looks like
the official is going to fold.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: This is going to cost you big time.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You got a secondary search and you had a
gun.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Listen it was a calculated risk. I’ve done
it a million times and never got caught.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Everything happens once if you live long
enough.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It doesn’t make sense to x-ray your bags
coming off the plane.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: This is Mexico, they do everything
backwards.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: So what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Don’t give me that bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: So how’s business?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap
labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border
in El Paso. I ferry ’em back and forth. They think I’m
John-fucking-Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: But don’t you stay in El Paso?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king
down here.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yeah, right…</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Oh, like you haven’t been in worse
places.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: And a level five shithole is better than a
level six. Your logic’s inescapable.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You been working?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Not for eight months. I was in Columbia
looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: How long you staying, Crease?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just
wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You did something on impulse?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Everything happens once if you live long
enough.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or wealth.
People ask you so often that you can’t have any left. Give me God what
you still have. Give me what no one else asks for. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You should be sleeping, baby.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I’m trying, mom.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Good news. You’re going back to school.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It
may take a few days, but you’re going back.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Could he speak English? Emilio couldn’t speak
English.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We’ll see. And thank your father in the
morning. A man always needs to be thanked.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: That’s right, a bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly
look the part.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You’re crazy. People would hire a has- been,
Ray? A drunk?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Well, you’d have to keep it under
control.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: And what if, just say, there was a kidnap
attempt?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You do your best. They won’t be paying you
enough to perform miracles.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: It’s not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at
half speed you’re pretty damn good.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: A bodyguard has to be close to someone all
the time. Willing to talk. I’m not good at that.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: So you’ll be the silent type. People will
appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I came to visit you.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Bullshit. I’ve known you fifteen years. You
don’t visit.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: A bodyguard… Who’s the guy?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in
Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He’s trying to persuade
Ford to partner with him. I think he’s in trouble. He asked me if I knew
anyone he could trust.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Oh, now you think I can be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then
decide if you want to… stick around or not.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Instructional tape on what I tell my
clients about bodyguarding.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: You drive easily. Smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Were you provided with a gun?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Show me, please.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Have you used this type before?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Is it loaded?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s loaded.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: You will meet my wife first. She would like
it if you are presentable, polite and respectful. You’ll be the fifth
candidate she’s seen this week.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the
Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn’t be able to afford
you in my current state. What’s the catch?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I drink.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: How does it affect you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: My coordination. Reaction time. If top
professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par
with the pay.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: And what if amateurs try it?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’ll probably kill them. Is that likely?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: No. And no one is to know of your drinking
problem. That includes my wife.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The world of our children. How dare they?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s war. The weakest suffer the most.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re American.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: So are you.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: My wife, Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Would you like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Thank you. Scotch and a little water.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’ve done much of this work before?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: He has experience in related work. A great
deal of it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No. I do not have family.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Pinta!</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Yes, mom?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This is Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Pinta, show him to his room.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: This way, Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I think it’s nice he’s American.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I think it’s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You realize that you’ve brought a killer into
the house.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thank you. I feel better now.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: If they like me.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Frank doesn’t take to most people. Do you
speak German?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Ein Klines Bisschen.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Frank only responds to commands in German. He
was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around,
but hates the fact he lives inside.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: We fixed the room up two weeks ago. Mom and
I. It’s nicer than before.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You’ve got a CD player if you like music. I
like music a lot.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: That’s ‘Bird.’ Emilio forgot to take him with
when he left.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who’s Emilio?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in
the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m here for you?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: In between you can take Mom shopping and to
lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Creasy. Just call me Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Creasy…</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Looks like he approves of you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: School tomorrow, baby.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I like him, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: He’s like a great big bear. ‘Creasy
bear’…</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: There’s something about him.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I think he’s been sick. He’s alright now, but
I think he’s been very, very sick.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, think about going to sleep. Good night,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Just like you, a big old bear.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Now’s your chance.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She likes him.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Creasy. Pinta likes him.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Pinta loves school. She’d like Count Dracula
is he took her back there.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Where are you from, Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The United States.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I know. But which state?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No state in particular.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: My mom and me are from Houston, Texas. Have
you been there?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You can drive and talk at the same time,
can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m looking for potential.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Potential? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Places where the road bends, places away
from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don’t have
to understand. I do. So no talking.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard
quit.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Let me guess, you wouldn’t stop talking?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Someone gave him more money than we
could.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m a bargain.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Being black, is that a positive or negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in
the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that,
Mr. Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee
or get a larger gun.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Beep the horn.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Isn’t it beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Sister Anna, the headmistress. This is
Creasy, my bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: No, Sister, he told me just to call him
Creasy. He’s American. From no state in particular.</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: You must look after our Pinta. We’re so
happy to have her back in school. Run along now, Pinta.</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: She’s late, Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yeah, I’ve got to get used to the routes. I
– It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: No offense, but I’m sorry that your
profession needs to exist.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: So am I, Sister.</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: Do you ever see the hand of God in what
you do?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Not for a long time, sister.</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: The bible says, “Be not overcome of
evil, but overcome evil with good.”</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m the sheep that got lost.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>sloppy cop one</strong>: Do you speak English, Senor?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yeah. And Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>sloppy cop one</strong>: You have an identification?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s a temporary license for the gun I’m
carrying. I just went through all of this at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Rayburn here. Creasy, what’s up? Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: There’s still ink on my fingers from last
week.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You got tossed. Don’t trust the cops,
especially the Judicials. Oh you know that?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: We’re taking a different way home.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I understand. Smart.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Did you like school, Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Not at all?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: But why not?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It wasn’t a school like yours and there was
no Sister Anna.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: So you were unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never
thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: What happened to…</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: …your hand?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m not paid to be your friend. I’m paid to
protect you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: And don’t start crying.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I’m not crying.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Look, this is the way I am. I don’t like
questions. I –</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have
everything you need.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you
didn’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The food’s fine. Sometimes I don’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you
have to… Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How are you getting along with Pinta?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: We’ll be okay once she realizes I’m not a
new toy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Yes, she told me. Do you have children,
Mr. Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You should know they’re tenacious when they
want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You’re paying me to protect her, not amuse
her. Right?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Look. Maybe this isn’t going to work. Maybe
you should ask your husband to hire someone… more sociable.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No, you’re right. You were hired to protect
her, that’s enough. I’m confident you’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I didn’t realize you had a gun. I know that’s
silly to say.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It makes it all seem so serious.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Please, it’s Lisa… I’ll be coming with you
tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Give me God what you still have. Give me what
no one else asks for.</p>
<p><strong>ronstadt</strong>: “I’m going back someday, come what may, to
Blue Bayou…”</p>
<p><strong>linda ronstadt</strong>: Well I’ll never be blue, my dreams
come true, on Blue Bayou…</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Rayburn… Creasy! What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I said, have you ever had a nine millimeter
round that just didn’t go off?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You mean a misfire?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I mean nothing. The hammer came down and
nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I’ve heard of it. Never happened to me
though. Maybe the firing pin’s off.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: It’s like we always used to say: a bullet
always tells the truth. What were you shooting at?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Sorry I woke you, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta, do you have a pencil?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I go to school, don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The traffic takes some getting used to.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Bye, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Don’t forget your towel.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She has swimming practice today. You’ll need
to pick her up at the pool.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I talked to her. She understands. She won’t
bother you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Creasy! Meet Jordan and Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So you’re the bodyguard? You used to be,
what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Does he talk?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He’s sexy…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You see any danger out there? The fear’s
worse than the reality.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would
you take a bullet for your employer, for Samuel?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I wasn’t hired to guard Mr. Ramos.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: For Pinta then?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jordan!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: If something happened, my reaction would be
to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would
benefit by the fact that… I’m a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What kind of an answer is that?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The answer is the truth. The question is
foolish.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch. I
promise not to let Evelyn spend too much.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You’re fast.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Once I get in the water but not starting off.
By the time I catch up, it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Hey… Pinta…</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Calling for Emilio’s macaw. I thought I heard
him.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Do you think he’ll come back?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Maybe. Did you hear him?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: How do you think he got out?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Well, I let him go.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: It’s better to be free, right?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I got you to talk, Creasy bear.</p>
<p><strong>ronstadt</strong>: “…I’m so lonesome all the time, since I
left my baby behind, on Blue Bayou.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ll call you from Detroit, baby.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You’re going to miss Mexican Halloween. The
Day of the Dead.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: You enjoy it for us, Pinta.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: They’ll be back in a week.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: They can stay for two weeks. I don’t
care.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The food is excellent, Maria. You have a
real talent.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: My pleasure, Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Come on. Come on. Bird!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta!</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I don’t think they’re broken. Anywhere
else?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: My ankle.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m going to get you out, okay?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Oh, Creasy…</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s okay. She’s just scared.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re sure she’s alright?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Okay, good, you’re sure. He took her for an
X-ray, but it’s just a bruise and a sprain.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thank you, Creasy. Give her my love.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you
had a family and you lied, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: White lie. I didn’t have a family. But I did
have two kids. They’re adults now.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Do you always sleep with him?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I’m too old for him. Don’t tell my
friends.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I don’t talk to them much. Does he have a
name?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I spoke to your mother. She sends her
love.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Some bodyguard I turned out to be. Good
night, Pinta.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Creasy? Could you play the song?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Blue Bayou. You got it.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I think I’ll sit in the front. There’s more
room for my foot.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: He’s only allowed to travel in the car on
weekends. Dad says the car will smell ‘doggie’.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Did you sleep alright?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: How’s the ankle? Can you put your weight on
it?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: It’s not too bad. Will it take a long time
before it’s better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I
was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: In a week you should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Doesn’t matter. I always finish second.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You need to practice.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Creasy, what’s a concubine?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: It was in a book at school. Concubine.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Well, it’s a sort of wife.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them!
How can that be?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: In the West, it’s one wife for one husband,
but different cultures have different rules.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: It must be difficult having lots of
wives.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You feel sorry for the husband?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by
a thousand?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Creasy, you’re smiling.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I guess I am.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: So how come you know so much about those
countries?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I had to do my homework on them when I
worked there. Also I enjoy history.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: What did you do in Asia? Is that where you
met the man with cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No, that was in Columbia.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Bang!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No, no, come back.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You don’t flinch when a gun goes off; you
react. You go. Don’t listen for the sound; don’t anticipate it.
Concentrate on the sound itself.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Don’t worry. You will.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Creasy, what happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: A man asked me questions once. He smoked a
lot. There was no ashtray.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Remember you asked me what state I was
from?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Where you’re from isn’t so much about
geography; it’s about events. Where you’re from is what happened to
you.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting
me.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I guess that really does make me a hard
case.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Did you used to?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yeah. Two or three.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off Pinta,
could you come back to take me to get my hair done?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Alright, I’ll leave you two to your
history.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Murdering people in the street… You had your
gun, why didn’t you shoot them?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides,
there was another one in the passenger side of the van with a sawed-off
shotgun. If I’d started shooting his friends, he would’ve had me. And
you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: A minimum close protection team consists of
four men for high threat targets and environments. Even in a low threat
situation, you need two guards plus a security trained driver.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You were never late before, I was
worried.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Where’s my mother?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I dropped her at home.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: It’s no wonder you’re late. Why didn’t she
just come with you?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Do you think my mother likes you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I think she’s afraid of me. But not the same
way most people are.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I’m not afraid you, Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I know you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Are you afraid of me?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I used to be. At first. But not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: The gunshot holds no fear.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You welcome the sound. The sound is what
lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those
blocks until you hear the sound.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I’m tough, Creasy. I’m tough as you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: There’s no such thing as tough. You’re
either trained or untrained.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Hi, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I want to thank you, Creasy. For what you
did for my wife.</p>
<p><strong>linda ronstadt</strong>: I’m going back someday, come what
may, to Blue Bayou.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: What’s so important in Los Angeles?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Your father has business.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Why today? And why’d she have to go with
him?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Good luck. I’ll be waiting here when you’re
done.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You’re coming with me.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Stand near the finish line.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The blocks.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I’m a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot
sets me free.</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta’s parents are in Los Angeles. I was
going to wait in the courtyard, but…</p>
<p><strong>sister anna</strong>: Today you are her father.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I won, Creasy! I won!</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Rethink following dialogue with reference to
Creasy / Rayburn background.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: My Dad said all your friends were dead.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: All but one. The most important one. When
we were eighteen, we made an agreement to “take the world” together.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Then one day, he calls and says, ‘I’m in
love and I’m moving to Mexico.’ I said what happened to the plan?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I said the plan was right here.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I got
it.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Can I kiss her now, or after you’ve gone to
bed?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Okay, I think now is as good as time as
any.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I bought it with my own money. I saved
it.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: It’s St. Jude, the patron saint of lost
causes.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: And hard cases. Creasy’s the reason
St. Jude became a Saint in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Thank you, Pinta, it’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Come on, baby. I feel like a third wheel.
Watch the kid.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Could I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Could I stop you?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You don’t drink like you used to.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: That’s not a question.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I know because I go in your room and check
the bottles.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Still not a question.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: My mom drinks, too… Why do people drink,
Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Now that’s a question. I don’t know about
your Mom. For me, the problem isn’t in the glass. The problem’s in
between my ears.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You think too much?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yeah. Because at one time, I didn’t think
enough.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He has to go, Samuel.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: What? Who?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Why? You were so pleased with him.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as
a father.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I’ve just been so busy, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He has to go.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: The three month trial ends in a week. I just
won’t confirm the position. That possibility was understood when I hired
him.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I won’t create bad feelings. And another
week won’t make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: It will be a hard break.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She’s young. She’ll get over it.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I wasn’t thinking of Pinta.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Creasy, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I don’t want to play piano! I want to
swim!</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: No discussion, Pinta. Mr. Lozzi is a famous
teacher. If he accepts you, you will play.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Frank. Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta, we’ve got to go. Travel sucks at this
time.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Frank. Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: That’s strange. Frank was a no-show. Not
like him to miss a ride.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then
tape them back together. I won’t be able to play the piano, but I could
still swim.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Don’t be a baby. You’re tougher than
that.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: There’s no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just
trained and untrained.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Then be trained.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I’m going to keep people safe someday. Just
like you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Be a swimmer.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I could do it. Remember the day you wanted
the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license
number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You’ll have to show me that number when we
get home.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Continue to play in the wrong key, like
you’re dyslexic.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Dyslexic?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a
complete block about ‘C’ Minor. But remember, “Whoever resists authority
will bring judgement upon themselves.” New Testament, Romans 13.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You’ll be back in the water in twenty- four
hours.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: For you, Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Remember ‘dyslexic.’</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Run, Pinta, run!</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Creasy…</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: Creasy!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta…</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Don’t die, Creasy, don’t die.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an American
citizen, is under arrest for the murder of two police officers, Hector
Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara. He is also the prime suspect in the
kidnapping of Pinta Martin Ramos.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: When did he say he would call back?</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: Senor Ramos. I am Ernesto Tazinari,
commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We do not need or want police involvement. I
am the negotiator. We feel a better guarantee of getting Pinta back
without your involvement.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: I have a written order from the Public
Ministry. Two police officers were killed. This is the Attorney General
Navarro Bernal Diaz.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: The law requires an intervention by the
authorities “de officio.”</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: It’s impossible. I cannot afford thirty
million. I will need to borrow the money.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: The realities are I do not have access to
this type of money.</p>
<p><strong>kidnapper</strong>: Two and a half million in two different
bags. The bags you can get from Save-On. Fifteen gallon, black canvas,
divide the money equally.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Yes, I will give you interest.</p>
<p><strong>kidnapper</strong>: I will instruct you on the exchange over
the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: The girl is a Mexican citizen. Her father is
Samuel Valencia Ramos.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9
year old. The bodyguard’s American. Not only that he’s black.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Is that good or bad?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: That’s good. Really good. He shot and
killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They’re
saying he’s responsible.</p>
<p><strong>reporter one</strong>: Beside the American in custody, are
any other Americans involved in the kidnapping?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We’re looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: The two officers who were killed. Records
show they were off duty at the time.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I’m not sure. All I know is they died
bravely.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: If they were off duty, why were they in a
patrol car? What exactly were they doing at the scene of a
kidnapping?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Were they known for their exceptional good
luck?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: They were known for their professionalism and
integrity!</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: No visitors.</p>
<p><strong>cop two</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I’m here to see my friend.</p>
<p><strong>cop two</strong>: Identification.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: When I heard it was this hospital I was so
pleased. There’s a pastry shop nearby. Delgado’s. Do you know it?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: The best pastries in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Miguel Manzano.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: He’s not a cop killer.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I’m sure he isn’t. Though he’s certainly
adept at killing.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: He was doing his job, protecting the girl.
If police were involved, you figure it out. I’m here for him.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You hear me, Crease?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You got three of the fuckers. All dead.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta…</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Two days gone. They’re negotiating a
ransom.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: These things take time, Mr. Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You have the money.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: OK,repeat the drop instructions.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided
into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which
will be checked at the bank by the K&amp;R agent. Then driven to the
house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery
car.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The car will not be powerful and have no
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I need a driver to drive Samuel, the
father.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: He has a heart condition. Angina. He
responds badly to stress.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and
Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times.
Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the
car.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There is a payphone on the Southeast corner.
The phone will ring. You will answer and wait for instruction.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We need proof of life.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is the father, there?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If this girl’s life is as important to you as
it is to me, do not play with the process. Family is everything. I am a
professional. You keep your word and I will keep mine.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: What’s the deal here?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: I wouldn’t gamble leaving him here. These
guys will kill him in a heartbeat ‘while trying to stop him from
escaping.’</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: He said no phones!</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: You do your job. I’ll do mine.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Leave the money in the trunk of the car with
white paper taped to the windshield, then return to your car and go
home. Do not look back.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Remember, I am a professional. If you keep
your word, I will keep mine. If you do not, then God be with your
child.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: She’s dead. Isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the
drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got killed.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You betrayed me. You killed my nephew and
took the money.</p>
<p><strong>k&amp;r agent</strong>: No, not us…No we did not.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Remember my words. Family is everything and
do not play with the process.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: She’s dead Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: She’s dead. They fucked with ‘the process’
and his nephew died.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He suffered gunshot wounds to the upper
extremity, chest and abdomen. He has a collapsed lung which is
stabilized, injured his spleen, which we may have to remove and ruptured
his intestine. He’s on strict bedrest or there’s a good chance we could
lose him.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: A strange man. He has much experience of
hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Did he say so?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: No. But a nurse knows.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Excellent work by the way. Three men dead.
Only ten rounds fired.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: If two of the men in my division could
shoot like that, I could get rid of the other thirty-six.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Believe it or not, you’re safe here. The
Judicial police will kill you. If they can. This page?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: You have a rather checkered past.
Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Am I a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: No. It would be convenient, but no.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe
then we’ll get somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: All these photos you just saw were of
policemen. Sadly they’re protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Stomach’s gone. But… okay.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I’ll get you up to the border. Friend of
mine’ll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Got a thing I gotta do first.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Creasy…</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: A lot of people are looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I guess that makes you the smart one.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: We’re interested in the same thing. I’m
writing a story.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: This might interest you. I found it across
the street.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Creasy at the police station. His photo
taken.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: It’s Santa Muerte. Death worship. The
religion of La Hermanidad. There’s a curse on you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s a little late.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: I can help. I have a situation Mr. Creasy.
There is a brotherhood called Le Hermanidad which protects both high
ranking Government officials, corrupt police, and organized crime at a
level that is very difficult for me to touch. I believe you were a
victim of this organization. You and this story may help to unmask
them.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You let them take her. She loved you and you
let them take her.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why are you here? Why didn’t you die?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Because… I was already dead.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I want you to know something. I’m going to
kill them. Anyone who opens their eyes at me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Creasy…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Kill them, Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Kill them all.</p>
<p><strong>pinta’s voice</strong>: Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where
you’re from?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta. Like you.</p>
<p><strong>pinta ghost</strong>: Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but
life is better.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>pinta ghost</strong>: I have to watch you now.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You’ll be Stateside by suppertime.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m going to need help, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Fuck. Look at you; you won’t last a day the
shape you’re in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen
removed.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I won’t kill again. Hunt people. I gave
that up. Anything else? It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Jesus, Creasy. You’re talking war.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Candy store. Every town in Mexico has one
if you know what door to bang on.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’ll take the .45 and the Webley .32.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I know it’s old fashioned, but it’s
reliable. Like us.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I need less than standard packing. Can you
knock up a case for fifteen of each?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make
sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Different door. Not far from here.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Maybe I can help your situation and you
mine.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: So where do we begin?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I need the name and address of the owner of
a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704…We didn’t get the last digit so
I need the ten possible matches.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: So what do I get in return?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Let’s see how the relationship develops.
I’ll call you in the AM. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: He’ll die of his wounds; bleed to death
before he can do anything.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we
are.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Because he’s outside. Because he’s not tied
to the same system we are.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: We did voice analysis of the last five high
profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man ‘The
Dreamer’. Listen to this.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “I used to run through the streets of Neza
because I was scared of being fucked with. I swore one day I would cross
the street walking. Now I walk.”</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: He’s protected by La Hermanidad.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I know this. Your point?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he
could be very valuable to us.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Then what do you have to lose?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: It’s a moral issue. On one hand you’re
cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem
that produces bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You are Jorge Ramirez.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: Stop here. Turn off the
ignition.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I am going to ask questions. If you don’t
answer, fully and truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have
to.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m going to cut your fingers off. One by
one. If I have to.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: That’s to cauterize the stubs.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I am the President of La Hermanidad.</p>
<p><strong>jorge’s voice</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Wh- wh- what do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t know. We were just given instructions
to take her.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Ordered by who?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t know! We work in parts. A voice calls
in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don’t even
know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and
the bosses don’t even see the target. They just make the deal!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who ordered it?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: The cops call him ‘The Dreamer’.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Where do I find him?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t know. No one knows.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t know, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I’m professional. I just do my job.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: He called me on the cell phone to set a time
and location for the switch.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: The one who transferred Pinta to their
car.</p>
<p><strong>flashbacks</strong>: See Pinta being manhandled from the
white Fiat to the trunk of Grand Marquis. She has been bound and taped
around the mouth and eyes.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t know, but I know his face.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I see him sometimes at the handball court in
Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: How do I recognize him.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his
back. He is part of the Brotherhood.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: In the next hour, where do I find your
partner?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: When will I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Her name was Pinta.</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: Roman’s Chapter 13:21. Do not be
overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. There is no authority
except from God.</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: Hola!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Tell me about the girl.</p>
<p><strong>guardian one</strong>: Who the fuck’s that?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: Everything on the cellphone. We wait
for calls. We have no number to call.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who pays you?</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: We have an ATM bank card. We draw out
300 dollars every two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What’s the PIN number?</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The number you use at the bank machine.</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: Four-seven-four-seven.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who killed her? You?</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: The boss did or his brother.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who’s the boss?</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: We don’t know! We never see his face!
We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl
that…</p>
<p><strong>flashback</strong>: Guardians POV. Hearing the above.</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: …his nephew was killed in the
exchange. And the money was stolen.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What money?</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: The ransom money. At the drop. He said
Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who’s Tazinari?</p>
<p><strong>guardian two</strong>: Head of the antikidnapping
division.</p>
<p><strong>flashback</strong>: Guardians POV. See the wall shake from a
bodily impact..</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>female guardian</strong>: He was screaming about the money
and his dead nephew. He threw the little girl against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>female guardian</strong>: She fell. She wasn’t moving. They
threw her body in the trunk of the car and drove away.</p>
<p><strong>flashback</strong>: Guardian’s POV through window. We glimpse
through a dirty window, Pinta’s body being put into a car trunk.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who? Who’s they?</p>
<p><strong>female guardian</strong>: The boss’s brother, I recognize his
voice. It’s high pitched. We call him Woody Woodpecker.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Now listen to me. If you tell me where to
find the boss. I will let you live.</p>
<p><strong>female guardian</strong>: Please. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>flashcut</strong>: We think it’s Pinta for a heartbeat, but
it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: Roman chapter 13:7. Therefore
whoever resists authority will bring judgement on themselves. Now it is
time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first
believed.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Rosanna Guerrero.</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: It’s Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: Los Arcos. Was a little girl
kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Last night. Do you know something?</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: What was her name?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Camila. Camila Valencias.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Camila.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’ve got her.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I need something. Do you have banking
connections?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: I have connections.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The PIN number is 4-7-4-7. I need to know
whose account it is.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Where do I find you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What do you know about the cop? Tazinari.
The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: He’s an old fashioned patrone with the
worst reputation. He’s high on my hit list.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Where does he live?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels
by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more
importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Give me the address.</p>
<p><strong>adjutant</strong>: Two in one day. And they died very badly.
Sandri and Jorge were prime suspects in twelve kidnappings in the last
six months.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Whoever did this was methodical, unafraid.
Was Jorge’s mugshot in the photos we showed Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>adjutant</strong>: No, I checked. But right after Sandri was
shot, a girlfriend of his was found naked, hysterical in the street. She
said it was a man fitting Creasy’s description who shot him.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a very
lethal human being.</p>
<p><strong>adjutant</strong>: You don’t seem very surprised?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: What’s surprising these days?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Your sister? Only a virgin cooks like
this.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Your man’s here. Interrogation room two.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage.
Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It’s a stew
really.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I already ate.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Tell me about your friend Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: You just said it. He’s my friend. Nothing
else to say.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I read the file. You and Creasy have seen
quite a bit together.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Two tourists who never went home.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: You helped him get this job.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: That’s what friends do.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others
will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not
better.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: You and Creasy both. A two man army
according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm.
Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi
military commanders. You two were a married couple.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: The kind that gets divorced, but still stay
friends.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: What happened to him? What happened to
Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: None of your business. Or mine for that
matter. I got nothing more to say.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: This is my jurisdiction. I want these men
as much as Creasy does.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: He’ll deliver more justice in a weekend,
than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I plan to. I’ll even help him if I can.
He’s going to lead me to the ‘The Dreamer’. Someone I want very badly.
But I’d like to understand him. Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you.
Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: What was she to Creasy then?</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel.
Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: And they took that away.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: A man can be an artist in anything. Stone,
paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy’s art is
death. And he’s about to paint his masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>rayburn</strong>: Me? I got Jap businessmen to drive across
the border. So, if you’ll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of
here…</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl
that was kidnapped yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: And left three more dead men.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: When you talked to him, did he look
sane?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: No. Not by the rules of polite society at
least.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I think he’s… magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: You only fuck me to get information.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: You only give information so you can fuck
me.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: A beautiful circle.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Let’s put Creasy to press. There’s a
vigilante cleaning up Mexico. An unstoppable hero.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: And as long as we’re talking information,
there’s something else as well.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I should start going for your tits
first.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m not here to hurt you. I need to borrow
your house and your car. Are you the proud owners of the Coupe
deVille?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: If you promise to speak softly and not to
shout, I won’t have to tape your mouths.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Did you know you have a dishonest policeman
living in your neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I know of you. You’re the American. The
bodyguard who’s killing the kidnapper.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: In the church, they say to forgive.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Forgiveness is between them and God. It’s my
job to arrange the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Do you have an old blanket you don’t care
about? I don’t want to burn that wall.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Under the bridge. Where the deal went south.
Now why don’t you tell me what went down?</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: Do you know who I am? I am the commandante
of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: And one of the founding members of La
Hermanidad.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: Correct!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: That’s not my dick. That’s the barrel of
your own gun. Shoved up your own ass.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: .44 Magnum. Now, how’s your hearing?</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: Please, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s all up to you, commandante. Tell me
about you and ‘The Dreamer’.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: I don’t know him. I saw the opportunity
and got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Lucky how?</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: That he used policemen. That you killed
them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn’t refuse our
involvement.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: And I had my men ready.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You stole the drop.</p>
<p><strong>more flashes</strong>: As we see this happen. POV from
opposite side of the bridge. POV from the drop car. See the money drop
get ambushed by unknown faces. ‘The nephew’ gets shot. The kidnapper
running the show sounds like Woody Woodpecker, high pitched squeaky
voice.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You done it before?</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: Yes. Many times.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: O.K. So tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: There was no ten million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: The ransom was ten.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: Two and a half. That’s how much there
was.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Don’t lie to me!</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips
of paper!</p>
<p><strong>flashback</strong>: Tazinari, in his office, sifting through
the paper.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Maybe your men stole from you.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: No. Whoever took the rest took it before
the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Who gave the bags to Ramos?</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.</p>
<p><strong>flashback</strong>: Ramos House. Bags of cash being switched
from the Mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd Mercedes in the garage.
See that Jordan does the switch, four bags on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>tazinari</strong>: That’s all I know! Please. I’m sorry for
the girl. But it was business! I’m a professional.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: That’s what everybody keeps saying.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Another favor… get me banking info on Jordan
Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on
Samuel Ramos.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: How do I contact you? We still don’t have
the ATM info.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You don’t, I’ll call you. Oh! I have a tape
recording that I am sure will interest you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m going to talk to your wife. If you move
or say one word, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m going to tell you a story. Your lawyer
is dead. Someone didn’t want him talking. Last week he wired $2.5
million into his U.S. bank account. Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also
dead. He hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5 million. If my
arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Your husband magically had five million
deposited in a U.S. bank account last Friday.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Planned what?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta
to be taken to a safehouse. I’m sure he thought she’d sit there for
three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn’t work out that way.
Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: On the surface it was low risk and high
return. This was the third autosequestra Jordan had organized for
clients. The other two succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain and
weakness only fueled your anger and determination. I wasn’t sure about
whether to go through with it or not. Then I woke up one day and it was
done. Jordan was supposed to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells the
truth. And the truth will set you free.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: In many ways I think this bullet should be
shared between you and Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>pinta’s voice</strong>: From the backseat I can see Creasy’s
eyes in the mirror. He watches and thinks. He never smiles. I wish I was
back in the front seat with him. I wish he would smile.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Hola…</p>
<p><strong>rosanna’s voice</strong>: Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: I traced the PIN. I have an address for
you. But I need to see you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I show, you give me the information?</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: We got the whole place wiretapped. But
no males that sound anything like ‘The Dreamer’.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: He’ll show.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: He’s the man, ‘the Boss?’ My guys got into
the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the
whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him. Manzano
looks at Rosanna. Now’s the time to really pressure him. Lets publish
his picture in tomorrow’s edition.</p>
<p><strong>rosanna</strong>: So how are going to recipricate?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m looking for Rosanna Guerrero.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That’s what
the papers have named you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s what you and Rosanna named me.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from
now on does so with my permission. Really. You won’t find a better carne
asada in all of Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: The last few days may represent the best
police work of my life.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: The same thing as you. Except, my reach
isn’t as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I don’t know shit about you.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: He was one of the original founders of ‘Le
Hermanidad’ in the days when it represented good not evil.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: He was murdered. And now here I am. Trying
to honor his memory. Hamstrung by bureaucracy and corruption. The
organization that he began now protects criminals at the highest level
where I would need a Presidential finding in order to expose it…or
you.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: My family lives in Miami. Because of the
death threats.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s not worth it. Be with them instead.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: It galls me to watch you. You can do as
much in days as I can in years. Men like the ‘The Dreamer’ are
protected. Out of everyone’s grasp it seems, but yours.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Are you going to arrest me or talk me to
death?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: My country needs justice. Proper justice.
Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be
brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law.
When they see it works.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: So you are going to talk me to death.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: You walk out and deal justice. You’re what
I wish I could be. The policemen who kills you, his family will have all
they want.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots
of kids. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I want to arrest you for murder! I want to
shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give
you my blessing.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys
were up to something. Are you two fucking?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: No, but I have to admit I thought about
it.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs
to. Name and address.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: You have no interest in making things easy,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I’m not… easy.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Percodan. I imagine you need handfuls by
now.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Account belongs to a woman we think is The
Dreamer’s girlfriend. Reina Rosas, who is 8 months pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: The plan is the girlfriend will lead you to
the Boss. You’ll lead me, and I’ll arrest him. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Creasy… I’d have liked to have known you
under different circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Off the top of my head, I don’t know what
they could’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: Romans chapter 13:4 - therefore
whoever resists authority will bring judgment on themselves. Now it is
time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first
believed.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’s inside. What should we do?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Reina Rosas.</p>
<p><strong>reina</strong>: Si.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: How do you contact ‘the Boss’?</p>
<p><strong>reina</strong>: We page him and he calls back on this cell
phone.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What is his name?</p>
<p><strong>reina</strong>: Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Daniel what?</p>
<p><strong>reina</strong>: Daniel Rosas Sanchez.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: So you’re married to him? And this looks
remarkably like his brother.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What is his name?</p>
<p><strong>reina</strong>: Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Do nothing. Prepare yourself for an
incoming call.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Hello Daniel. I’ve got your family and I
want to negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Mr. Creasy. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I want you.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: How much do you want?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: It’s non-negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Two million U.S…. Three million U.S.?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I told you, non-negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: The most important thing in life is family.
And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I want you.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: This is not possible. But in that house I
have money. If I tell you where –</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Your brother wants to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>aurillio</strong>: Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Listen to me. Listen! I’m going to take your
family apart piece by piece.</p>
<p><strong>reina</strong>: Under the sink. We have money under the sink.
Six million dollars. It’s wet but good.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Listen! I will give you a life for a
life.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Her life for your life.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Whose life?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: The girl’s. Pinta’s.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You’re a liar. Pinta’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’m a businessman. A dead girl is worth
nothing. She is alive.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I want proof of life. What did she call her
bear?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Creasy. She calls the bear ‘Creasy
Bear.’</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Okay. Where?</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: We received enough of a signal to at
least put him in the Zona Colonia. Shit not enough time. He hung up.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Lisa, don’t hang up on me. Pinta is
alive.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: I want you to get into your car now and meet
me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway
junction. In 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re lying. I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Then don’t come.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Creasy… Wait.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Stay here. If you do something stupid, we
won’t get her back.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Pinta. Pinta.</p>
<p><strong>pinta</strong>: I love you, Creasy… And you love me,
right?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: I’m your chauffeur now, Creasy.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: All units. Commence the operation. Repeat.
Commence.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Creasy? Creasy?</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Goddamn you.</p>
<p><strong>manzano</strong>: Hold at the perimeter. Until I enter.</p>
<p><strong>creasy’s voice</strong>: Ezekiel 25:17. Blessed is he who in
the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost
children.</p>
