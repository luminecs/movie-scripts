<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Top that off for ya, Hon?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: What’s in the case?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: You’re always lugging that case around. I’m
curious.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: What do you sell?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: I’m… in restaurant supplies. I didn’t get
your name?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Must travel a lot, huh?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Whole country, or just hereabouts?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: I don’t mean to be rude but–</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: How’s your wife feel about it?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: She must get lonely, with you gone all the
time. Does she?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: Look, I…</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Do you get lonely?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Ya miss fucking her, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: Listen, I don’t know who you are but you
can’t–</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Did it myself. It’s sort of a hobby. I’ve
got more. Would you like to see them?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Tell me: those jokes about the traveling
salesman and the farmer’s daughter - are they true?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Here. This one’s my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Really says it all, wouldn’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: You’re a… You’re sick.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: That’s a matter of opinion.</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: You’re sick!</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Mmm-hmm?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: I’m having a problem - with another customer.
I’d like you to ask him to leave, please.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: What kind of problem?</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: He’s–</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: What-do-you-want?! What-do-you-want-with-
me?!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: There’s a rest stop, next off-ramp. Pull
into it.</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: I have some money. It’s not a lot but–</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Nobody wants your money, Harold. Just pull
in.</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Because I don’t wanna do this at 70 miles an
hour. It could be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>speck</strong>: Please, Mister - what do you want from
me?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Got a spot set up for you, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Ms. Potter’s the nice girl you met at the
desk. She puts a package together for all the new agents, things to know
about the area, help with finding apartments and such. This one’s
yours:</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Not so different from Dallas, is it?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>grieves</strong>: Ya like Frito Pies?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I dunno. What are they?</p>
<p><strong>grieves</strong>: Welcome to the minors.</p>
<p><strong>a brief montage</strong>: Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching
as THOSE OTHER AGENTS take calls, strap on guns, head out on assignment.
Men in motion.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Here. Lemme do that.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It takes some experience.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You’re Mackelway, right?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Fax came in for you. It’s the room next
door.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Oh. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all
day, or do you wanna do something?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Afternoon, Rick. Looks like a
robbery/homicide. Body’s over that way.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Ya run the plates?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Fella’s name is Harold Speck. Traveling
salesman, from Abilene.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What the fuck’re you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>jumbo</strong>: What’s it look like, Bud?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You guys ever heard of evidentiary
procedure?</p>
<p><strong>mackwelway</strong>: Sorry, Sir. There wasn’t time.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway.
Let’s have a look.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sort of a… stickler for procedure.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: I imagine you would be.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar.</p>
<p><strong>jumbo</strong>: You said toss it.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Hold it a second.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Smells like… clove.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Where the hell’d you find this guy?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Field Office. Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Well now… So what the hell’s he doin’
here?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Christ…</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Mrs. Speck?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Just wanted to offer my condolences. I
didn’t know him well but… I think Harold was a much more complex man
than people realized.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: He was, wasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I’m very sorry for your loss, ma’am.</p>
<p>****: Please…</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Agent Mackelway. I was ’bout to introduce
you, but I understand that won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Seems your former office has decided we
might need some help on this one. So they sent out Agent Kulok.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Tom.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Fran.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: I guess we’re skipping the tearful
reunion. Have a seat, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: How’s things back at the ranch?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Movin’ right along.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Okay. Whadda we know?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Picked up a foot-print in the back seat of
Speck’s car, size-and-a-half bigger than Speck’s.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: ’Kay.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Wounds on Speck’s throat indicate that he was
strangled from behind… I think our guy waited for him in the backseat,
sprung this on him once the car was moving.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Lab picked up talcum traces on the edges of
the paper, consistent with powdered gloves. So he gets the dropped in
his lap, it spooks him, and the car winds up in the ravine.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I don’t think so, no. I think it was
pushed.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How ya figure?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: The look of the tracks. Foot-prints near
the embankment.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Okay. So our guy likes to draw pictures of
body parts and then spring ’em on people. What’s that get us? That’s
what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Oh. ’Fore I forget. This came in for
you:</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: It’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Don’t start in on me, Les. I couldn’t get the
pickup started and Harlan took the Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Holy Hell. My one shot at winding up on
“Cops” and I’m in my weekday boots!</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: He was a quiet guy. Normal. Liked to read
fishing magazines. Not much of a tipper. Is that a lousy thing to
say?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What can you tell us about the other
man?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Like I said, I never really saw him. Harold
came up, complainin’ about the guy - but time I turned, he was gone.</p>
<p><strong>fran mack</strong>: Could you de– Did you get a–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Can you describe him, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Sure. He was…</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: That’s weird. Guy was in here better part of
an hour. We had a real pleasant chat… But I can’t remember a thing about
him. For the life of me. Couldn’t even tell you what color his eyes
were.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Happen to see what he was driving?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: That one’s easy. It’s still in the lot. The
Bonneville out there with the awful paint job.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: We ought to work out some kind of
protocol.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty
silly, our talking over one another.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Fine. I’ll handle them from now on.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Trunk’s ajar.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why eyelids?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No other signs of torture here. Why take
somebody’s eyelids off?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: So they can’t blink.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It’s a metaphor - to make certain the
victim sees… or to make certain that we see something. Or maybe it’s
just a fuck-you.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m sorry about Don.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You’re not wearing your ring anymore.</p>
<p><strong>singing first and second graders</strong>: A-may-zing Grace,
How sweet the sound–</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Agent Mackelway?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: 50, lean, with a friendly smile.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Benjamin spent hours down here.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Did he have access to those?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: No. They’re staff-only.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Would you mind opening them for me?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He was here… seven years you said?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Off and on. It’s not uncommon for our guests
to vanish for months at a time.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I ran the name through our database, just
to be sure. There’s never been an Agent Benjamin O’Ryan in the
Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: No… but as elaborate fantasies go, it was one
of my favorites. And he always seemed so sincere about it.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Is that what you called him?
Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: It’s what he wished to be called.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: That one’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: He painted one of the walls in his room,
too.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Can I see it?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: We’ve painted it over.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Still, might be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. street - matamoros - night - mackelway’s
flashback</strong>: We’re RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of
chipped-adobe, hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and
the thuds of our own heavy feet.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor #1</strong>: D’you understand how fucked we
are?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor #1</strong>: Leaving a tissue sample in the care
of a Mexican lab? Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: They assured me that they understood
protocol.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor #1</strong>: Well guess what? They didn’t. And
this prick’s gonna walk, ten murders or not.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I guess you fellas’re never unaccounted for,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Anything urgent?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Ever seen a fifty-foot shark?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Fifty-foot shark. Ever seen one?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Doesn’t mean there aren’t any.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Did you know him? The guy who used to
stay upstairs. “O’Ryan.” Did you know him?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Why? Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You said “Did.” Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Oh. I mis-spoke. No, he’s not dead… You
know him?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He ever talk about this? A circle with a
slash through it?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: That’s not a circle. It’s a zero.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Oh. How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Little cute for my taste, but I can stand
three minutes of it.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’ll have a seven and seven, please.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Seven and seven. Got some i.d.?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s in the car. No one’s asked me for it
for a couple years now.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: If ya hurry, you’ll still catch the end
of the song.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Please, Mister…</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Hey, listen, I’m sorta new in town. Ya know
where I can find a good donkey show?</p>
<p><strong>starkey</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Oh. Forgot. Wrong country… In America
animals have rights. Don’t they, Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>starkey</strong>: How the fuck should I know?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I don’t think the eyes are right.</p>
<p><strong>composite artist</strong>: Narrower?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No, they were… I don’t really know.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sir? We got an i.d. yet?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Might wanna find yourself a
fender. You’re gonna need to sit down. It’s Virgil Ray Starkey.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Starkey did this?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: No. Starkey’s the one on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>grieves</strong>: Gonna make a wallet-size of that one?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Give him a break, Grieves.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: ’Scuse me.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Got nothing on the last fax.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Came from a business center at a Mariott in
Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Whadda we know about the map?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost
perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Why’s Greenville in blue?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Only city where the date on the fax and
the date on the map didn’t correspond.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Fax lists the date of disappearance as
August 7. On the map he’s written “10- 26.”</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Any of these bodies been recovered?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Two so far. Female, disappeared from
Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male, Trenton, New Jersey, January
5th.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: But both bodies were found over a
thousand miles from where they’d last been seen. One in Montana, the
other in Oregon. Got autopsy reports on both.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Either of the bodies have the zero on
them?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why you?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He could be sending these to any agent in any
office in the country… But he’s sending them to you. Why?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: This is Agent Kulok. Who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Do you know a professor named Daitz? Says he’s
from Tulane.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yeah. Criminal Psych. I’ve been trading
e- mails with him.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: One moment, please…</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Professor Daitz?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Agent Mackelway. Come in…</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: …The name of this theory was “Suspect Zero.”
The idea of Suspect Zero posits that if a serial killer were diabolical
enough, he could traverse the country without ever being caught, killing
randomly.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Tell me, what makes a killer catchable?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Patterns, repetition of behavior.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Now imagine a killer with no patterns, no
tell-tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden desire to be caught. A perfect
vessel of evil, killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in
his wake… He’d be immune to capture, wouldn’t he? Your task forces, your
forensics teams - they’d be helpless.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Is that something you believe in,
Professor? Evil?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: As a citizen of the world, it’s hard not to.
Wouldn’t you say? Evil is all around us, I think - a part of the natural
order of things. Like gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave, corrupting
everything it touches. A virus invades a cell, causing it to
dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But did it ever occur to you that
something may have invaded that virus, something capable of using it to
mutate so powerfully?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Just because something’s invisible to us
doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: A shark, as we know, will only attack humans
if he runs out of food. But biologists have theorized that for a shark
of fifty feet the ocean would be an endless buffet. He’d never run out
of food, so he’d have no need to come to the surface. Consequently, we
would never see him. Do you follow? We’ll never see one. But that
doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Hence Suspect Zero.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Some of my colleagues think I’m fascinated
with evil. I think the truth is just the opposite: evil is fascinated
with us. What better vehicle could there be for creating havoc in the
world - what better instrument - than Man? We’re vain, we’re stubborn,
we’re deceitful, we have an imagination that is limitless in its
perversions. Of course Evil keeps trying to harness us. Wouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>coed</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry. I was looking for
Professor–</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Hey! You! What’re you doing down
here!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: We’re gonna need everything you can
remember about this guy, Tom. Physical description, any kind of
distinguishing characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: The suspect fled. Couple janitors walked
in on it.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: They’re fine. But the description they
gave of him wasn’t worth a damn.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Case you’re curious the real Professor
Daitz is on sabbatical, out of the country. We can’t find him. Whose
idea was it to meet there?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: His, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Uh-huh. Did he ask you to come alone?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: But you figured you’d get a bigger pat on
the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help - is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sir, I’m the one who took the call. Agent
Mackelway was acting under the assumption that I’d already checked the
guy out. We’re both to blame.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview
unaccompanied?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Then whose fuck-up is it?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It was… poor judgment, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: You wanna work alone, start your own
agency.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Let’s get you two started.</p>
<p><strong>continue intercut</strong>: this incoming fax, set against a
few tableaus of Americana. Innocence…</p>
<p><strong>band-leader</strong>: Everybody into the gym!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Girls, I want you to come in now. Startin’
to rain.</p>
<p><strong>a young woman’s voice</strong>: Agent Mackelway?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I can’t anymore.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Can’t sleep?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What was that music?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It’s Navajo. A song for dead warriors. I
never played it for anybody before.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Just had a feeling you’d like it.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I dunno. The way you stare when you think
nobody’s looking.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What’re you–</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I can’t get a read on this guy.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Why is he sending us all this shit? I’ve
got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing people. What’s he telling us?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He kills a travelling salesman, then a
school-teacher. Then Starkey? It doesn’t connect.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You’re a mess…</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m fine. I’m clear. I just didn’t think
this could wait. Fran, this guy is trying to point us at something.
Starkey’s part of it. But the other two don’t connect.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Did you drive here?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m fine! I just need somebody to think
this through with me! He wanted to meet me. It’s like he was
interviewing me somehow. What is that? Then he kills Starkey. So what
was he doing with Speck and Fulcher?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You wanna come in?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No. No. You come out. Get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Out where?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I dunno. Somewhere. We’re right on the
edge of this thing.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m going back to bed. You’re welcome to the
couch if you want. I think you could do with some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mack…</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Agent Mackelway?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Mrs. Speck. Just had a few more
questions.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I’m sorry I don’t have more time, Agent
Mackelway. It’s my PTA Day.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It’s fine. I should’ve called.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I hope I was of some help.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You were. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: A friend of mine said I’ll feel like this one
month for every year we were together. Sort of a grieving rule-of-
thumb. Have you ever heard that?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Oh. There was one other thing: Did he
keep any kind of chemicals around the house? Acids, that sort of
thing?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It’s nothing. Trace elements we found on
his trunk. Any interest in chemistry? Maybe as a hobby?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Anyway, thank you. And thanks for the
coffee. Next time I’ll call first, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: No trouble at all.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor lady</strong>: He’s inside! He’s inside! Went in
through the back!</p>
<p><strong>abilene cop #1</strong>: Freeze, Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It’s okay, Fellas. FBI.</p>
<p><strong>abilene cop #1</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>abilene cop #1</strong>: Oh Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Listen to me Cowboy. You have any idea the
kind of favors I had to pull with the Abilene cops to cover your
ass?!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sir…</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house
without a shred of evidence and NO</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: The sample I took from Speck’s bumper…
It’s crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with oil of Clove, the clove
neutralizes the odor of the acid.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It was SPECK not his killer who was
hiding something.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent
from Dallas gets sent down to the Wichita Falls Field Office? I’ll give
you TWO WORDS… Hell I’ll even write it down for ya.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: “EVIDENTIARY PROCEDURE.” Don’t talk about
it. Learn it.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Turns out you were right about this guy.
You were right about both of them. But that doesn’t change the fact that
you went about your business like a rookie. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>grieves</strong>: Nice job, Mack.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Seated please.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Okay. We’ve got a serial killer of serial
killers.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: He’s a transient with a history of mental
illness. He also happens to think he’s a former agent of this Bureau.
And he is pursuing something that he calls “Suspect Zero.” Anybody got
anything intelligent to say?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: That’s what I thought…</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Somethin’, huh? Guy with a wife and kids
keepin’ bodies in his attic?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yeah. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Yeah. Just… Wondered if you could do me a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Her name’s Karen Sumpter. We were friends.
She disappeared last year. Nobody knows where. She was a little wild,
but not like that.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Anyway, I know you’re gonna be in on the
autopsies - of the girls they found over at Speck’s. Figured you might
see if one of ’em was…</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: If it is, I’d like to be the one to notify
her folks. Out families’ve been friends for years.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sure. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Thanks… ’Night.</p>
<p>****: Please…</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Evening.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Evening, Officer.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: See your license, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: ’Course. Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: See your registration, please?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Mind stepping out of the car, please?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Officer, I am carrying something that could
be construed as a weapon. I’d like to hand it over, voluntarily, so you
won’t think I’m trying to conceal anything. Would that be all right?</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: What kind of weapon, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: It’s a hunting knife, right here on my
hip.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I was on my way to the woods. My gear’s in
the trunk. Would you like me to hand it to you? I don’t know what the
procedure is for something like this.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Take the weapon off your hip, place it on
the ground, and kick it toward me.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Happy to.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: What exactly were you planning on hunting,
Sir?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: A fifty-foot shark.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Ya know, I used to be in law enforcement
too.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: That right?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Mmm-hmmm. FBI. ’Course this was some years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Psy Ops. Classified.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Had anything to drink tonight, Sir? Under
medication of any kind?</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Oh. Sorry. Just found myself wondering what
was inside that truck.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Sir, I’m going to ask you to hand me the
keys to your vehicle, please.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Kulok.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He really was FBI.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: O’Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep.
Fran, he was FBI.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m look at his whole history! Citations,
letters of commendation, even his fucking test scores from Quantico. The
guy was an agent.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Listen to me–</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Shit! Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Read anything interesting lately?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: That was him.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He called you at home?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Jesus. Call me back.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: O’Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I’ve found him, you know.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Zero.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Zero’s a myth. You made him up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Myths don’t kidnap little boys. Do they?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Was she pretty?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I could hear her moaning, right under the
Navajo chanting. Whole thing was downright tribal. What’s she look
like?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Fair enough. We’ll stick to business: How’d
ya like my old room?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: “Hope House.” You were there.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Dyson re-paint it? My room. Did he re-paint
it?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yeah. White.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: …But you saw what was underneath, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: No. Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: No. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I’ll be in my office.</p>
<p><strong>kathleen</strong>: Charlie?! Charlie, where are you, Honey?!
Charlie?! Honey, are you out here?!</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Got one of those pins in Denton yet?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: O’Ryan was spotted there tonight. Took a
squad-car and a side-arm from a State Trooper. ’Bout an hour later a
five-year old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up the Interstate.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: The vehicle was found in an abandoned lot.
We’re establishing a perimeter around the city now.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: But the Trooper wasn’t hurt…</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: What makes you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Professional courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Is that… possible, Sir? An agent can just
be deleted?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Looks like it.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I couldn’t understand it before - pushing
Speck’s car onto the state line. Makes sense now. He wanted to make the
case Federal. He’s drawing us in.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Why would he do that?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: So we’d be paying attention when he found
Suspect Zero.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Ya know what? I’m getting extremely tired
of hearing that word. In fact, that’s gonna be policy from now on. No
Zero.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sir, profile the guy. He’s straight outta
Quantico. All he’s doing is working a case, like we would. He’s not
kidnapping little kids - he’s chasing the guy who’s doing the
kidnapping! Look at the map!</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: What’re you saying - that all these
abductions are the work of one guy? Do you know how fucking insane that
is?! Not let’s try something that actually makes sense: He sends in
these faxes, picks off three scumbags. For what?! So we’ll think exactly
what you’re thinking right now - that we’ve got a friend out there,
somebody willing to take out the garbage for the rest of us. And it’s
all horse-shit!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What if it isn’t? What if there really is
a Zero out there and O’Ryan’s the one guy who’s got a shot at him?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Fuck’s sake, Mackelway - when did you
start buying into this guy?!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He’s smarter than we are.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Speak for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sir? What if I told you I knew how to
catch him?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: And what if I told you that the way I’d
catch him involved sitting in a dark room, with nothing in front of me
but a pad of paper… until I’d tapped into some kind of… energy out
there. The collective unconscious. Something. If I told you I thought I
could target and</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: locate him, without ever leaving this
building, what would you say?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: I’d say you’d watched too many
“X-Files.”</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Y’ever heard of a project called
“Icarus,” Sir?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Agents, trained to “see” distant
locations using nothing but the mind. They called it Remote Viewing.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Army stole it from the Soviets. The
Bureau stole it from the Army - used it to track serial killers.
Experimental program. O’Ryan was the first agent they recruited.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Good for him.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit. …except, it
worked. It’s how he drew this:</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He’d never been in that house before. He
just saw what was in there - the Bureau taught him how… same one that
deleted him. Same one that’s trying to catch him now… Does anything
about all this strike you as odd?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: I’m going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred. You
can take the day off.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Oh silly songs get sillier/When you hear
them once again/And maybe you’re hearing an echo/Or maybe it’s only a
friend!</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Does he listen to you?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: It’s not a strength of his. I’m noticing
that lately.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: I’m not so sure. You oughtta sit him down,
remind him how a chain-of-command works.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He’s fine, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: They going to Denton?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: But not you?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sitting in on two autopsies.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yeah. Why?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Are they male or female?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: The autopsies.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Females - Logan, Utah; and Decatur,
Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: So is this what happens when an agent spins
out? He gets deleted?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sometimes. The lucky ones get sent to
Wichita Falls.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Friend of the Receptionist, missing for
about a year now. I told her I’d let her know if the body ever turned
up.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: The Receptionist.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Her name’s Katie.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I see you got the blue pin out of
Greenville.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yeah. Last night. Kid named Simms.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No. I meant her. The girl.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Did ya look at her vitals?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Greenville, Texas. October 26.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Need an address on this fax line.</p>
<p><strong>grieves</strong>: ’Kay.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: O’Ryan’s in Greenville.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What makes you think so?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: That’s where Zero is. Lloyd Simms -
October 26, ’99. Karen Sumpter - October 26, 2000. Both disappeared from
Greenville. Zero comes back to the same spot, once a year. Today’s the
25th.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Wait. When did we establish that Zero was
real?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: O’Ryan thinks so.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’ve seen this before.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Same burn-mark. I saw it before but it
didn’t register.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He burns them?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I dunno. Almost looks too symmetrical to
be a burn. They’re autopsying her this morning?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grieves</strong>: Fax number traces back to a Copy Center on
I-30. Greenville. I called. They don’t open for another hour.</p>
<p><strong>day-manager</strong>: Naah. I never saw that guy in here.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He sent a fax from this location ’bout
seven o’clock this morning.</p>
<p><strong>day-manager</strong>: We’re closed at seven.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Are your faxes programmable? Could he
have paid last night to have it sent this morning?</p>
<p><strong>day-manager</strong>: Sure. But that costs extra.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Were you here last night?</p>
<p><strong>day-manager</strong>: Nope. Haven’t done nights since I got
promoted.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: ’Scuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Mackelway.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: It’s not a burn. It’s a freezer-burn.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You’re sure.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: There’s crystallization in the blood stream.
The blood never clotted in the wound. It’s a freezer burn… I’m having
the other body shipped out - the guy from Trenton. We’ll see if he’s got
the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: So… he keeps the bodies in a freezer,
then buries them…?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I dunno. If he kept them in a freezer they’d
have marks like this all over. Wouldn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Thanks, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You want some more breakfast, Honey, or
are we just rollin’ right on into lunch?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Just some coffee, thanks. Might hit the
buffet in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Meatloaf’s lookin’ good today.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Mackelway.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Surveilling. What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Driving to Greenville.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Why would you be doing that?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I think agents are safer when they have some
company. I can send along Katie if you’d rather.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m at the truck-stop we traced. Off
the</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m ’bout a half hour out.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’ll order some lunch for you. Hear the
meatloaf’s good today.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a
plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor- Alpha. Got that?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You okay? Kid? You okay in there?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’ll be back. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Well, well… Must be quite a moment for you.
Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>five year-old</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Morning, Baby!</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: I told you she’d be here. He’s been a brat all
morning.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Hands up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Awfully conventional - don’t ya think?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Apprehend the fugitive, then call it in for
your pat on the head.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I’ll get over it. But I’m not too sure that
little boy will.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What little boy?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: The one from the Diner, in Denton.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I can find him.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Same way I found Starkey, and Speck, and
Fulcher… and you.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I need someplace quiet - someplace I can
concentrate… And your assurance that once he’s located, we go get him
together.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Then I can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I’m talking about uncompromised justice. No
trials. No lawyers. No hiccups in a chain of evidence that can set a
monster free. You of all people should be able to appreciate the value
of that.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Where’s the boy?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I won’t be doing this much longer. Actually,
this is the end of it. I’ve</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: come to accept that. But there is one last
thing to–</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Where’s the boy, O’Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Do we have an understanding?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Enough of this shit. Where’s the boy?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Good. This is good. Sort of thing you’d
never find in a procedural manual. It tells me I was right about
you.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I will kill you, O’Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I know. But we have work to do first.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Where’s the Goddamn kid?!?!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Don’t pick that up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: This is the guy who put all those pins in
that map of yours! And I can take you to him!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Fine. Where is he? Where is he?!?!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Right here…</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: “Imagine a killer with no patterns, no
tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any kind. No hidden desire to be
caught. A perfect vessel of evil.”</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: And the name we give that killer… is Zero.
Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: It’d be customary at this point to start
praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven’t seen too many answers though. I
wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and
save you, either. You’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Where’s the boy?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to
watch yourself say something so heroic. I’m almost envious.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: The boy’s under the bed. In pieces. Are you
afraid?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I know what you’re thinking: “There is pain
coming. Am I going to take it like a man?” Let me put you at ease: You
won’t. None of them do. Men, women, children. They all weep, they all
beg. They pass out, they piss themselves. They attempt negotiation: You
wouldn’t believe how many men have lain right where you’re lying right
now - grown men, with wives and children back home - offering all kinds
of sexual gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve. It’s
pathetic. Are you afraid? Then there’s that moment when they realize
there’s nothing left to be negotiated. They’re just mine. And they’re
helpless. And the look in their eyes, the level of surrender… well, it’s
almost pornographic. I put this mirror here because I don’t want you to
miss it. Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: How about now?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Are you afraid?!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Open your eyes! Open your eyes Goddammit or
I’ll cut the fucking lids off!!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Stand up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: It’s over now. Can you stand?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: We really do have to go.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: This is where he’ll be. With the boy. Zero.
He’s coming home today. We’re going to be there.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: You’re ready to come with me now. You’ve
been in the pit. Stand up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Soon. I promise… But not yet.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Please… I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Tell me about Icarus.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Just… wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: There were five of us. In the program.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: We’d come in in the morning, have a cup of
coffee, talk about the Yankees. Then you’d go to your room, with your
pen and</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: your pad of paper, always alone, and you’d
try to lock in. Son of Sam. John Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. He might be
driving his car, or having a beer or brushing his teeth… or cutting
someone’s eyes out.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: If you did it right, you got all of it: The
way it sounded. The way it smelled… Those people were looking up at you,
begging you for mercy. It was like being God. …except you’re not.
Because you can’t do a thing for them. Can’t make it stop. You’re just
watching, helpless.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: They wired us into this current, the five of
us: darkness, the pit itself. We were plugged right into it. But nobody
taught us how to shut it off… We were just men. And we saw things men
shouldn’t see. Agony, torture, evil - and it never shut off. Even now,
it’s still there.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: They all wind up like you? The other
agents?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: No. They’re dead now.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: They broke down. Then they opted out. Killed
themselves… After a while, those conversations about the Yankees became
impossible. Ya see?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Can’t bring you in with me. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me’s… How
many of ’em is he actually responsible for?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: All of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: It’s his birthday, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: He comes home on his birthday.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Darling?! That you?!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Daryl? Honey?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: This is Mackelway! I’m travelling north
on… Grove Road, approaching I-30 in Greenville. Request immediate
back-up. Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated truck, Texas license plate
Alpha–</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Brakes!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Travelling due west now. Don’t see a
name. It’s a service road, running parallel to the–</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: What’re you…</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Can’t let him hit the Interstate.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Get the van open! He’s got a kid in the
van!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Up.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Glad you’re here, Man. Guy was about to kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’ll take it from here.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Are you going to shoot him?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Give me the gun, O’Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Hey, I just surrendered.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: I surrendered! That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Look at him, Mack. He’s not human anymore.
Go dig up that old lady’s backyard - you’ll find bodies there… Maybe
hundreds of them. Of course, ya gotta get a warrant first, chain of
custody’s gotta be followed. One breach, and he walks. My way, he’s
eliminated; the world is rid of him. It’s a lot closer to justice than
having some Prosecutor tell you you’ve left a tissue sample in the wrong
lab. Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Give me the fucking gun!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: You have to understand: none of this was
arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I saw us here. You did too.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Okay. You made your point.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Bullshit! If I’d made my fucking point you
would’ve shot him yourself by now!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Just drop it.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Would you shoot me?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I want you to think for a second. About your
destiny. Who you are. You’re cursed, like I am - except you keep running
from it. You hear things. You see things. That’s why you can’t sleep,
why your head always aches.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: …and it’s why you are going to let me kill
this animal. And then you’re going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I can’t do that, Mack. I’ve seen all this
already. For months now.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Every time, we’re in this field: same wind,
same rain. And you…</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: It’s okay. I want you to. I’m begging you
to.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mack?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: I’m tired, Mack.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Pull the trigger… I’m not going to jail. Now
pull the fucking trigger!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Fucking coward.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Some things are not up to us to decide. They
just exist. They’re inevitable. This field. This rain. This moment. It
has all already happened. You know that. You’ve seen it too.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mack?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Shut it off for me.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m not going to kill you, O’Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Of course you will. I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: You saw wrong!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mack? Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: You don’t understand. Those fucking
faces</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: on that map. They call to me. I see their
eyes in the dark - they’re staring at me: “How did you let this happen
to me?” But that’s the thing about them - they’re like pictures. They
never blink. They just…stare, and always at me. That’s my destiny, do
you see? I didn’t help them when they needed me and this is my penance.
Fine. I ACCEPT IT. But I’m opting out now, ya get it? I can’t stand this
anymore! I wanna close my eyes for once and see something other than
torture. It’s not a bad start, Mack. We’ve made the world a little safer
now. Speck, Fulcher, Starkey, now Zero. We’ve made justice. But I get
some too. You have to end all this for me. That’s why you’re here. It’s
your destiny.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Stop telling me about my fucking
destiny!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: But I’ve seen it!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Open your eyes, O’Ryan! Here I am,
standing here. I’m not shooting you. Doesn’t that fucking tell you
something? You’re a guy with a skill. Period. They taught you more than
they should’ve. I’m sorry about that… But you’re not God. You can’t see
everything.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Yes I can! And you can too! That’s why I
chose you!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mack?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Fine. I’ll make it easy for you:</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Put the fucking thing down, O’Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Look. It’s perfect. Won’t even need a
hearing this way. You apprehended the suspect in the commission of a
murder. Then he turned on you and you fired in self-defense.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: These things are bigger than you - haven’t
you seen that yet? Destiny. Justice. Mercy. They’re vast. We’re just
puppets!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m not going to kill you!</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: You don’t get to decide that!</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Yes I do!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: It’s funny. I never saw anyone else out
here. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Do it, Mack. Please. Please. I’m begging
you.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: I’m not you.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Yet.</p>
<p><strong>o’ryan</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Nice work. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>mackelway</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: O’Ryan. Where is he?</p>
