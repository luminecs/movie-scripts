<h1 id="days-of-heaven">days-of-heaven</h1>
<p><strong>days of heaven”</strong>: by Terry Malick</p>
<p><strong>setting</strong>: The story is set in Texas just before the
First World War.</p>
<p><strong>cast of characters</strong>: BILL: A young man from Chicago
following the harvest.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: The beautiful young woman he loves.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: The owner of a vast wheat ranch in the Texas
Panhandle.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Abby’s younger sister, a reckless child
of14.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: The bonanza foreman, an enemy of the
newcomers.</p>
<p><strong>miss carter</strong>: Chief domestic at the Belvedere,
Chuck’s home. McLEAN: Chuck’s accountant.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A young pilot who interests Ursula. A
PREACHER, A DOCTOR, AN ORGANIST, VARIOUS HARVEST HANDS, LAWMEN,
VAUDEVILLIANS, etc. “Troops of nomads swept over the country at harvest
time like a visitation of locusts, reckless young fellows, handsome,
profane, licentious, given to drink, powerful but inconstant workmen,
quarrelsome and difficult to manage at all times. They came in the
season when work was plenty and wages high. They dressed well, in their
own peculiar fashion, and made much of their freedom to come and go.”
“They told of the city, and sinister and poisonous jungles all cities
seemed in their stories. They were scarred with battles. They came from
the far-away and unknown, and passed on to the north, mysterious as the
flight of locusts, leaving the people of Sun Prairie quite as ignorant
of their real names and characters as upon the first day of their
coming.” Hamlin Garland, Boy Life on the Prairie</p>
<p><strong>1 int. chicago mill - series of angles</strong>: WORKERS in a
dark Chicago mill pound molten iron out in flaming sheets. The year is
1916.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext. mill</strong>: BILL, a handsome young man from the
slums, and his brother STEVE sit outside on their lunch break talking
with an older man named BLACKIE. By the look of his flashy clothes
Blackie is not a worker.</p>
<p><strong>blackie</strong>: Listen, if I ever seen a tit, this here’s a
tit. You understand? Candy. My kid sister could do this one. Pure
fucking candy’d melt in your hand. Don’t take brains. Just a set of
rocks. I told you this already.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Blackie, you told me it was going to snow in
the winter, I’d go out and bet against it. You know? There is nothing,
nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea.</p>
<p><strong>blackie</strong>: Okay, all right, fine. Why should I be
doing favors for a guy that isn’t doing me any favors? I must be losing
my grip. I got to give it to you, though. Couple of guys look like you
just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens. You ever get laid?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>blackie</strong>: Without a lot of talk, I mean? ’Cause I’m
beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up
for a couple of bucks. It’s clean, and you know what you’re in for.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. alley</strong>: Sam the Collector’s GANG swaggers
around in the alley behind a textile plant. ONE of them has filed his
teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them. ANOTHER wears
big suspenders. Sam and Bill appear to know one another.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, Billy, you made a mistake. You made
somebody mad. Nothing personal, okay? It’s just gotta be done. You made
a mistake. Happens in the best of families.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I paid you everything I have. Search me. The
rest he gets next week.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Listen, what happens if I don’t do this? I
gotta leave town?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I could do something, you know. You guys wanta
do something to me, I know who to tell about it. You guys ought to think
about that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You maybe already did something. Maybe that’s
why you’re here, on account of you already done something.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I haven’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Then you’re all right, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>razor teeth</strong>: You got nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Cut it out, Billy, all right? You know what can
happen to a guy that doesn’t wanta do what people tell him? You know. So
don’t give us a lot of trouble. You’re liable to get everybody all
pissed off. Sam, a busy man, checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>4 new angle</strong>: Bill puts his hand on the ground. Sam
drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his
gang. Bill sobs with pain.</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. lot beyond mill</strong>: Bill and Steve drag a safe
by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill. Blackie walks
behind.</p>
<p><strong>blackie</strong>: You know what I’m doing with my end? Buy a
boat. Get that? I had a boat. I had a nice apartment, I had a boat.
Margie don’t like that. We got to have a house. “I can’t afford no
house,” I said. She says, “Sell the boat.” I didn’t want to sell my
boat. I didn’t want to buy the house. I sell the boat, I buy the house.
Nine years we had the house, eight of them she’s after me, we should get
another boat. I give up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Same as always, I do all the work, you gripe
about it. Suddenly FOUR POLICEMEN surprise them from ambush. Bill lets
go of the rope and starts to run. Steve does not give up immediately,
however, and they shoot him down. Bill picks up Steve’s gun and fires
back. Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon
bring to heel. The FOURTH stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he
attends to Steve.</p>
<p><strong>6 tight on steve</strong>: Steve, badly wounded, is about to
die.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Run. Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I love you so much. Why didn’t you run. Don’t
die. Steve dies. Bullets kick up dust around him. He takes off running.
One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. sewer</strong>: ABBY, a beautiful woman in her late
twenties, attends to Bill’s wounds in a big vaulted sewer. Her sister
URSULA, a reckless girl of14, stands watch.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They shot the shit out of him. My brother. I
couldn’t believe what I was seeing.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Hold still, or I can’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I love you, Abby. You’re so good to me.
Remember how much fun we had, on the roof…</p>
<p><strong>8 ext. roof - matte shot</strong>: Bill and Abby flirt on the
root of a tenement, happily in love. The city stretches out behind
them.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. bed - quick cut</strong>: Abby lies shivering with
fever. Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth. Ursula rolls paper flowers
for extra change. BILL … even when you were sick and I was in the
mill.</p>
<p><strong>10 int. mill - quick cut</strong>: Bill works in the glow of
a blast furnace. He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the
workers. A pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his
appearance. He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any
better–like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim
hopes for a better way of life. BILL I won’t let you go back in the
mill. People die in there. I’m a man, and I can look out for you.</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. siding outside mill</strong>: Along a railroad spur
outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen
from the tenders. BILL We’re going west. Things gotta be better out
there.</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. tenement</strong>: A POLICEMAN, looking for Bill,
roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live. Suddenly Bill runs
out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full
of water.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: What’d you do? Bill shrugs, then hits him
again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun. Abby calls
Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of
their laundry off a clothesline.</p>
<p><strong>13 ext. freight yards</strong>: They hop a freight train.</p>
<p><strong>14 credits</strong>: The CREDITS run over black and white
photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters.
Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway. A blind man hawks
stale bread. Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant. Laundry
hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes. Police look for a thief under
a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look.
The CREDITS end.</p>
<p><strong>15 ext. moving train</strong>: Abby and Bill sit atop a train
racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I like the sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Everybody does. They laugh. She is dressed in
men’s clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap. They are sharing a bottle
of wine.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I never wanted to fall in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Nobody asked you to. He draws her toward him.
She pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s the matter? A while ago you said I was
irresistible. I still am.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: That was then. She pushes her nose up against
his chest and sniffs around.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You playing mousie again?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I love how nice and hard your shoulders are.
And your hair is light. You’re not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum
on every night.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I love it when you’ve been drinking.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re not greasy, Bill. You have any idea
what that means?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Kind of. They share the boxcar with a crowd of
other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill
gestures out at the landscape.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Look at all that space. Oweee! We should’ve
done this a long time ago. It’s just us and the road now, Abby.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: We’re all still together, though. That’s all I
care about.</p>
<p><strong>16 ext. jerkwater</strong>: The train slows down to take on
water. The hands jump off. Each carries his “bindle”– a blanket and a
few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on
hand to greet them. The harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German
to Uzbek to Swedish. Only English is rare. Some retain odd bits of their
national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and
so far from home. Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps.
Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the
factories of the East. They dress inappropriately for farm work, in the
latest fashions.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Elbow room! Oweee! Give me a chance and I’m
going to dance! Bill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white
Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a
sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to
set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known
that he was born to greater things.</p>
<p><strong>17 new angle</strong>: Bill comes upon a BIG MAN whose face
is covered with blood.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good, very good. Where you from, mister?</p>
<p><strong>big man</strong>: Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Like to see the other guy. Bill helps him to
his feet and dusts him off. A TOUGH walks up.</p>
<p><strong>tough</strong>: You doing this shit? Then keep it moving.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh yeah? Who’re you? The Tough hits Bill
across the head with his ax handle.</p>
<p><strong>tough</strong>: Name is Morrison. Bill looks around to see
whether Abby has seen this. She hasn’t. He walks dizzily off down the
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>18 new angle</strong>: He takes Abby by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What happened to your ear?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nothing. She is a sultry beauty–emancipated,
full of bright hopes and a zest for life. Her costume does not fool the
men. Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wagons</strong>: The FOREMEN of the surrounding farms
wait by their wagons to carry the workers off. A flag pole is planted by
each wagon. Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a
blackboard. BENSON, a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a
megaphone. In the background a NEWCOMER to the harvest talks with a
VETERAN.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Shockers! Four more and I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How much you paying?</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Man can make three dollars a day, he wants
to work.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who’re you kidding? Bill mills around. They
have no choice but to accept his offer.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Sackers! Abby steps up. Benson takes her for
a young man.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: You ever sacked before? She nods.
Transcriber’s Note: the following seven lines of dialogue between the
NEWCOMER and the VETERAN runs concurrent with the previous six lines of
dialogue between Benson and Bill and Abby. In the original script they
are typed in two columns running side-by-side down the page.</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: Not good. Where you from? NEWCOMER
Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: How’s the pussy up there? NEWCOMER Good.
The guys tough out here? VETERAN Not so tough. How about up there?
NEWCOMER Tough.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: When’s that?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Last year. He waves her on. Abby nods at
Ursula.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re making a mistake, you pass this kid
up.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Get on. He snaps his fingers at her. Bill
climbs up ahead of the women. Anger makes him extremely polite.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You don’t need to say it like that. Benson
ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first.</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. plains</strong>: Benson’s wagons roll across the
plains toward the Razumihin, a “bonanza” or wheat ranch of spectacular
dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a
hill.</p>
<p><strong>21 ext. bonanza gates</strong>: The wagons pass under a large
arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished
kingdom. Goats peer down from on top. Bill looks at Abby and raises his
eyebrows.</p>
<p><strong>22 ext. belvedere</strong>: At the center of the bonanza,
amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories
tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground,
protected from the elements, “The Belvedere” occupies the highest ridge
around, commanding the view and esteem of all. Filigrees of gingerbread
adorn the eaves. Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been
planted in the front. Peacocks fuss about the yard. There is a lawn
swing and a flagpole, used like a ship’s mast for signaling distant
parts of the bonanza. A wind generator supplies electric power. A white
picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where
the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell. Bison
drift over the hills like boats on the ocean. Bill shouts at the nearest
one.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yo, Beevo!</p>
<p><strong>23 tight on chuck</strong>: CHUCK ARTUNOV, the owner–a man of
great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor–stands on the front porch of
the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals.</p>
<p><strong>24 ext. dormitory</strong>: Benson drops the hands off at the
dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a
ceiling of exposed joists. Ursula sees Chuck watching them.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Whose place is that?</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: The owner’s. Don’t none of you go up around
his place. First one that does is fired. I’m warning you right now. In
the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their
bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn. Abby
and Bill slip off to share a cigarette. Ursula tags behind.</p>
<p><strong>25 ext. rock</strong>: Bill lifts a big rock. Abby applauds.
Ursula kneels down behind him. Abby pushes him over backwards.</p>
<p><strong>26 ext. barn</strong>: Ursula gasps as Abby tumbles off the
roof of the barn and falls through the air screaming:</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Urs! She lands in a straw pile.</p>
<p><strong>27 tight on abby and bill</strong>: Bill takes Abby by the
hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her
across the chest.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Ready? She giggles her consent. He crushes her
in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets
her go. She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication.</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. lantern - night</strong>: Bill looks deeply into
Abby’s eyes by the light of a lantern that night. They have made a
shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood
like children.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re all I’ve got, Abby. No, really,
everything I ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I know. They laugh. He bends to kiss her. She
pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sometimes I think you don’t like men.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: As individuals? Very seldom. She kisses him
lovingly.</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. wheat fields - dawn</strong>: The sun peers over the
horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as
far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and
surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: “… that your days may be multiplied, and
the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your
fathers to give them, as the days of’ heaven upon the earth.” The
harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn
off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in
summer.</p>
<p><strong>30 tight on wheat</strong>: Chuck looks to see if the wheat
is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper.
He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the
chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown
properly hard. Tiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness:
grasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk. He pops
the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in
his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher
begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a
smoking censer, the other with a crucifix. All repeat the “Amen.” Benson
makes a tugging signal with his arm. A Case tractor–forty tons of iron,
steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive–blasts its whistle.
This is the moment they have been waiting all year for.</p>
<p><strong>31 other fields - series of angles</strong>: A SIGNALMAN with
two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In
the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews
set to work. Abby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing
machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to
make bunches or “shocks.” A cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting
the sun down to a cold red bulb. Abby is well turned out, in a boater
and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a
picnic. Bill, too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark
trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of
the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed
toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring. While at work
he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him
the air more of a researcher than a worker. The harvesters itch madly as
the chaff gets into their clothes. The shocks, full of briars, cut their
hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire. Nobody talks. From
time to time they raise a chant. Ursula, plucking chickens by the
cookhouse–a shack on wheels– steals a key chain from an unwatched coat.
Benson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their
hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city
people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most–Abby and Bill are no
exception–have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it.
Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not
damaged. Where the others loaf whenever Benson’s back is turned, Bill
works like a demon, as a point of pride.</p>
<p><strong>32 chuck and benson</strong>: Lightning shivers through the
clouds along the horizon. Chuck looks concerned. Benson consults a
windsock.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Should miss us.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: They must be having trouble over there,
though. Abby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does
her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields.
One so beautiful is unprecedented.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I didn’t know we had any women on.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: I thought she was a boy. Should I get rid of
her?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>33 montage</strong>: A COOK stands on the horizon waving a
white flag at the end of a fishing pole. Ursula bounds through the wheat
blowing a horn. Benson consults the large clock strapped to the back of
his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air. Their faces black with
chaff, the hands fall out in silence. They shuffle across the field
toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid
being spiked by the stubble.</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. cookhouse - stubble field in b.g.</strong>: The
COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses.
The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water,
brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon
and a fire truck are parked nearby. Most sit on the ground to eat, under
awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools. The
Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon. Bill is carrying Abby’s
lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.</p>
<p><strong>dutchman</strong>: Your sister keep you warm at night? Bill
throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists
are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away,
flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt.</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. grain wagon - stubble field in b.g.</strong>: Bill
and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon. Demoralized,
Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water. Bill inspects them
anxiously. They are swollen and cracked from the morning’s work.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I ran a stubble under my nail.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Didn’t you ever learn how to take care of
yourself? I told you to keep the gloves on. What can I do if you don’t
listen? Bill presses her wrists against his cheek, ashamed that he can
do nothing to shield her from such indignities. In the b.g. a MAN with a
fungo bat hits flies to SOME MEN with baseball gloves.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You can’t keep on like this.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What else can we do? She nods at the
others.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Anyway, if they can, I can too.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That bunch? Don’t compare yourself to them.
She flexes her fingers. They seem lame.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You drop off this weak. I can make enough for
us both. It was a crime to bring you out here. Somebody like you. Right
now, what I’m doing, I’m just dragging you down. Maybe you should go
back to Chicago. We’ve got enough for a ticket, and I can send you what
I make. He seems a little surprised when she does not reject this idea
out of hand. Perhaps he fears that if she ever did go back, he might
never see her again.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s the matter? She begins to cry. He takes
her in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I know how you feel, honey. Things won’t
always be this way. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>36 abby and bill - chuck’s pov</strong>: The men knock out
their pipes as Benson’s whistle summons them back to their stations.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Tick tockl Tick tock! Nothing moving but the
clock! Bill pulls Abby to her feet. He sees the Dutchman he fought with
and shoots him the finger.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You better be careful.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Of him? He’s just a. sack of shit.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Stop it! He’s liable to see you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I want him to. He’s the one better be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>37 tight on chuck</strong>: Chuck looks on. Something about
her captivates hint, not so much her beauty–which only makes her seem
beyond his reach–as the way she takes it utterly for granted.</p>
<p><strong>38 montage</strong>: The work goes on through the afternoon.
The pace is stern and incessant, and for a reason: a storm could rise at
any moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up. A
series of dissolves gives the sense of many days passing. Iany moment
and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up.Animals–snakes
and gophers, rabbits and foxes–dart through the field into the deep of
the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the
reapers make their rounds. The moment will come when they will every one
be killed with rakes and flails. The wheat changes colors in the wind,
like velvet. As the sun drops toward the horizon a dew sets, making the
straw hard to cut. Benson fires his pistol. A vine of smoke sinks lazily
through the sky. As the workers move off, the fields grow vast and
inhospitable. Oil wells can be seen here and there amid the grain.</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. abby’s row</strong>: Bill helps Abby finish up a row.
Thousands of shocks stretch out in the distance. Benson comes up behind
her, making a spray of the stalks that she missed.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: You must’ve passed over a dozen bushels
here. I’m docking you three dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’re you talking about? That’s not
fair.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Then leave. You’re fired. Abby is
speechless. Bill squeezes the small rubber ball which he carries around
to improve his grip and swallows his pride.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: You want to stay? Then shut up and get back
to work. Benson leaves. Abby covers Bill’s embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I guess he meant it. She turns her back to him
and goes about picking up the sheaf Benson threw down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He did. Ask him. If you can’t sing or dance,
what do you do in this world? You might as well forget it. Ising or
dance, what do you do this world? You might as wellu rorget it.</p>
<p><strong>40 ext. stock pond - dusk</strong>: Their day’s work done,
the men swim naked in a stock pond. Their faces are black, their bodies
white as a baby’s. A retriever plunges through the water fetching
sticks.</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. road - dusk</strong>: Some bowl with their hats on in
a dusty road and argue in Italian.</p>
<p><strong>42 ext. belvedere - doctor’s wagon - dusk</strong>: A
physician’s wagon stands in front of the Belvedere. Bill hunts nervously
through it for medicine to soothe Abby’s hands. Not knowing quite what
to look for, he sniffs whatever catches his eye. Suddenly the front door
opens and Chuck steps out with a DOCTOR, a stooped old man in a black
frock coat. Bill, surprised, crouches behind the wheel. As they draw
closer their conversation becomes faintly audible. CHUCK How long you
give it? DOCTOR Could be next month. Could be a year. Hard to say.
Anyway, I’m sorry. CHUCK Got to happen sometime. They shake hands</p>
<p><strong>43 new angle - duski</strong>: The Doctor snaps his whip at

<p><strong>44 ext. barn - dusk</strong>: Ursula and Abby case the barn
for dinner. Abby points at a pair of peacocks strutting by, nods to
Ursula and puts a finger over her lips. Ursula, with a giggle,
followsone while Abby stalks the other.</p>
<p><strong>45 ext. rapeseed field - series of angles - dusk</strong>:
The peacock, a resplendent white, leads Abby through a bright yellow
rapeseed field. It keeps just out of reach, as though it were enticing
her on. as though it were enticing her on.’U All at once she looks up
with a start. Chuck is standing in front of her, dressed in his habitual
black. The Belvedere rises behind him like a castle in a fairy tale. She
remembers Benson’s warning that this is forbidden ground.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I forgot where I was.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Don’t worry. Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: We hardly ever see a woman on the harvest.
There is a small rip in the side of her shirt, which the camera observes
with Chuck. She pulls her sweater over it.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You like the work? Where do you go from
here?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Wyoming and places. I’ve never been up that
way. You think I’ll like it? He shrugs. Shy at first, she begins to open
up.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: That dog belongs to you that was running
around here? That little pointer? What’s his name</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Buster.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He seems like a good dog.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He came over and tried to eat my bread from
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Maybe I should keep him penned up.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You asking me?</p>
<p><strong>46 ext. spit - dusk</strong>: Bill finds Ursula roasting a
peacock on a spit. She has arranged some of its tail feathers in her
hair.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re getting prettier every day.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Aren’t you sweet!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Depends how people are with me. Where’s Abby?
I found her something. He holds out a jar of salve. Ursula shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She mention anything to you about going back?
What? Ursula has no idea what he is talking about. 47 EXT. STRAW STACK -
MAGIC HOURMost of the workers are fast asleep around the strawp�lU Most
of the workers are fast asleep around the strawpile, their bodies
radiating out like the spokes of a wheel. A few stay up late to shoot
dice in the back of a wagon.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. separate stack - magic hour</strong>: Abby and Bill
have laid their bedrolls out by a stack away from the others. A fire
burns nearby. Abby look at the stars. Bill shines his shoes. The straw
is fragrant as thyme.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’ve had it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re tired, that’s all. I’m going to find
you another blanket.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No, it’s not that. I’m not tired. I just
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t you want to be with me?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You know I do. It’s just that, well, I’m not a
bum, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I know. I told you though, this is only for a
while. Then we’re going to New York.Then we’re New York.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: And after that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Then we’re there. Then we get fixed up.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You mean spend one night in a flophouse and
start looking for work. They are silent for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You should go back.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: And leave you? I couldn’t do that. Someday,
when I’m dying, I’d like somebody to ask me if I still see life the same
way as before–and I’d like them to write down what I say. It might be
interesting.I Suddenly they look around. The chief domestic at the
Belvedere, a churlish lady named MISS CARTER, stands above them with a
salver of fruit and roast fowl.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s going on? Who sent it? She nods up
toward the Belvedere and sets it down.I</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What for? She withdraws with a shrug. She does
not appear to relish this duty. Bill watches her walk back to the buggy
she came down in. Benson waits beside it.U</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She’s the kind wouldn’t tell you if your coat
was on fire.U</p>
<p><strong>49 new angle - magic houri</strong>: Abby, with the look of a
child that has wandered into aI magic world, digs in. Bill looks on,
suspicious of the_ motives behind this generosity.</p>
<p><strong>50 ext. field with oil well - ursula’s theme - magic
hour</strong>: A bank of clouds moves across the moon. Ursula roams the
fields, keen with unsatisfied intelligence. The stubble hisses as a hot
wind blows up from the South, driving bits of grain into her face like
sleet. From time to time she does a cartwheel. Equipment cools in the
fields. Little jets of steam escape the boilers of the tractors.Ursula
stops in front of a donkey well. It nods up and down in ceaseless
agreement, pumping up riches from deep in the earth.</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. bedroom window - magic hour</strong>: The camera
moves through the bedroom window to find Chuck asleep on his pillow. The
wind taps the curtain into the room.</p>

Biblical figure with a long plaited beard, in a frock coat and Astrakhan
hat, sitting in a_ chair on the open prairie, guarding his land with a
brace of guns. This man will later be identified as his FATHER.</p>
<p><strong>53 ext. fields - day</strong>: The next day Benson yells
through a megaphone from atop a stool.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Hold your horses!I The huge tractors start
up with a bang. Despite Benson’s warning a team of Percherons breaks
free. Threshing, the separating of the wheat from the chaff, has
begun.</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. separator - series of anglesi</strong>: Sixty foot
belts connect the tractors to the separating machines, huge rattletrap
devices that shell the wheat out at deafening volume. Benson tosses
bundles down the hissing maw, squirts oil into the gears, tightens
belts, chews out a MAN who’s sliced a hand on the driveshaft, etc. Bill
works on the straw pile at the back of the machine, in a soft rain of
chaff, spreading it out with a pitchfork. Ursula helps stoke the tractor
with coal and water. When nothing is required of her she sneaks off to
burrow in the straw. Gingerbread on the eaves of the tractors gives them
a Victorian appearance. Tall flags mark their position in the field.
Abby moves quickly, without a moment’s rest, sewing up the sacks of
grain as they are measured out at the bottom of the separator. A
clowning WORKER comes up and smells herU like a flower.</p>
<p><strong>55 ext. grain elevatorsu</strong>: Fully laden wagons set off
toward distant grain elevators.U</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. couch on ridge</strong>: Chuck and McLEAN, his
accountant, sit on a ridge away from the chaff, in the shade of a beach
umbrella. Chuck keeps track of operations through a telescope. Our last
view of Abby, we realize, was from his POV. A plush Empire couch has
been drawn up for his to rest in. At a table beside it, McLean computes
the yield. McLEAN This must be wrong. No, dammit, nineteen bushels an
acre. Chuck sails his hat out in the stubble with a whoop. McLean leans
over his adding machine, cackling like a thief. McLEAN Say it goes at
fifty-five cents a bushel, that means a profit of four dollars and
seventy-five cents per acre. Multiply by twenty thousand and you’re
talking over six figures.I</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Big year. McLEAN Your biggest ever. This
could make you the richest man in thePanhandle. You ought to get out
while you’re this far ahead. You’ll never do better. I mean it. You have
nothing to gain by staying.U nothing to gain by staying. I</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I want to expand. I want to run this land
clear to the Oklahoma border. Next spring I will. McLEAN And gamble
everything?U I You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I been out here all my life. Selling this
place would be like cutting my heart out. This is the only home I ever
had. ThisI is where I belong. Besides, I don’t want to live in town. I
couldn’t take my dogs.I</p>
<p><strong>57 chuck’s pov - telescope matte</strong>: Chuck takes
another look at Abby through the telescope. 25</p>

<p><strong>bill</strong>: Big place here.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: The President’s going to pay a visit next
time he comes West.U</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Got a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: No.I Bill puts his hat back on. He keeps wet
cottonwood leaves in the crown to cool himself off.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why’s that guy dragging an expensive piece of
furniture out here? Reason I ask is he’s going to ruin thefinish and
have to strip it.I Benson hesitates, uncertain whether he might be
divulging a confidence.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: He’s not well.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s the matter with him?I Benson
immediately regrets having spoken so freely. He checks his watch to
suggest Bill should get back to work. This uneasiness confirms Bill’s
sense that Chuck is gravely ill.</p>
<p><strong>59 ext. separator - duski</strong>: Abby is sewing up her
last sacks by the separator that evening when Chuck walks up, still in
the flush of McLean’s good news. The others have finished and left to
wash up. He sits down and helps her. Shy and upright, he does not know
quite how to behave with a woman.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Probably be all done tomorrow. You still plan
on going North? She nods and draws her last stitch. Chuck musters his
courage. It must be now or never.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Reason I ask is maybe you’d like to stay on.
Be easier than now. There’s hardly any work after harvest. The pay is
just as good, though. Better in fact.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why’re you offering me this? My honest face?
Chuck takes a moment to compose his reply.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I’ve watched you work. Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Maybe I will. She backs off toward Bill, who
is waiting in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: My brother. Chuck nods.</p>
<p><strong>60 new angle - dusk</strong>: She joins Bill. He gives her a
melon, wanting to pick up her spirits.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This is all I could find. You feeling better?
What’d he want? They look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>61 ext. river - dusk</strong>: As Bill and Abby bathe in the
river that evening, he tells her what he seems to have learned about
Chuck’s state of health. Down the way Ursula sits under a tree playing a
guitar. Otherwise they are alone. They all wear bathing suits, Bill a
shirt as well.</p>
<p><strong>billu</strong>: It must be something wrong with his lungs. He
doesn’t have any family, either.his lungs.I I</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: So what? Bill shrugs. Does he have to draw her
a picture? A shy, virginal light has descended over the world. Cranes
peer at them from the tamarack.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Tell him you’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What for? Bill is wondering what might happen
if Chuck got interested enough to marry her. Isn’t he soon to die,
leaving a vast inheritance that will otherwise go to waste?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know I love you, don’t you? ABBY Yes. Abby
guesses what is going through his mind, and it shocks her.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Oh, Bill! He takes her into his arms, full of
emotion.I</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What else can we really do? I know how you
feel, but we keepon this way, in five years we’ll be washed up. He
catches a stick drifting by and throws it further down stream.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You ever think about all those ladies parading
up and downU Michigan Avenue? Bunch of whores! You’re better than anyI
of them. You ever think how they got where they are? He wants to breathe
hope into her. He thinks of himself as responding to what she needs and
secretly wants. When she does not answer he gives up with a sigh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Let’s forget it.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I know what you mean, though. He takes her
hand, with fresh hope of convincing her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We weren’t meant to end up like this. At least
you weren’t. You could be something. I’ve heard you sing. You have a lot
of fine qualities that need to come out. Ursula, too. What.U kind of
people is she meeting up with, riding the rods? The girl’s never had a
clean shot– never will. She oughta be in school.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You wouldn’t say this if you really loved
me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But I do. You know I do. This just shows how
much. We’re shitI out of luck, Abby. People need luck. What’re you
crying about? Oh, don’t tell me. I already know. All on account of your
unhappy life and all that stuff. Well, we gotta do something about it,
honey. We can’t expect anybody else to. Abby runs into the woods.U</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Always the lady! Well, you don’t know how
things work in this country. This is why every hunkie I ever met is
going nowhere. Why do you want to make me feel worse than I already
do?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You people get hold of the guy that’s passing
out dough, giveI him my name, would you? I’d appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>62 tight on bill</strong>: Bill skims rocks off the water to
calm himself down. HeI feels that somehow he did not get to say what he
wanted to.U</p>
<p><strong>63 ext. woods by river</strong>: Abby is dressing in the cool
woven shade of the woods when Ursula, her face caked with a mask of
river mud, jumps from the bushes with a shriek, scaring the wits out of
her sister.</p>
<p><strong>64 ext. belvedere - dusku</strong>: On their way home they
pass the Belvedere. A single light burns on the second floor. Abby picks
cornflowers to put in her hair. Bill runs his hand down her back.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why’re you touching me that way? He shrugs.
Muffled by the walls of the house, above the cries of the peafowl, they
can faintly hear Chuck singing to himself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’s singing.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He can’t be too sick if he’s singing to
himself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He might be singing to God. They look at each
other and smile. It does not appear that she has held what he said by
the river against him. Bill stands for a moment and looks up at the
Belvedere before passing on.</p>
<p><strong>65 ext. separator, last sheaves, rats</strong>: Work goes on
the next day. As they near the last sheaves of unthreshed grain,
hundreds of rats burst out of hiding. The harvesters go after them with
shovels and stones. The dogs chase down the ones that escape.</p>
<p><strong>66 benson and chuck</strong>: Benson and Chuck smile at each
other.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: We should be done around four. They
improvise a chat about past harvests. Years of shared hardship have
drawn them close. Chuck trails off in the middle of a reminiscence.
Something else weighing on his mind.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You put her on the slowest machine? Benson
nods.U</p>
<p><strong>67 new angle</strong>: The threshing is done. A bundle is

<p><strong>sorrowful man</strong>: And I let somebody like that get away
from me. Redhead. Lost her to a guy named Ed. Just let it happen.
Should’ve gone out there outside the city limits and shot him. I just
about did, too. If you’re knocking yourself out like this, I hope it’s
for a woman. And I hope she’s good looking. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>70 tight on abby and ursulai</strong>: Abby snatches a
cigarette out of Ursula’s mouth, takes a drag and throws it away. When
Ursula goes to pick it up, she stamps it out.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Don’t spend a cent of that.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Why don’t you leave me alone?U</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m not going to sit around and watch you
throw your life away. Nobody’s going to look at you twice if you’ve got
nothing to your name. Ursula dislikes meddlesome adults. She takes out a
pouch of tobacco to roll another cigarette. Abby swats it out of her
hand and chases her off.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You want me to cut a switch?</p>
<p><strong>71 series of angles - festivities - dusku</strong>: There are
feats of strength and prowess as workers from the many fields of the
bonanza join to celebrate the harvest home: boxing, wrestling, barrel
jumping, rooster bouts, bear hugs, “Crack the Whip” and nut fights. Two
tractors, joined by a heavy chain, vie to see which can outpull the
other. Chuck lifts the back wheel of the separator off the ground;
Benson replies by holding an anvil at arm’s length; they tease each
other about showing off. A GYMNAST does flips. They all seem happy as
kids on holiday.</p>
<p><strong>72 new angle</strong>: Bill and Ursula share a cigarette.
Ursula tries on his sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: We going to stay?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If she wants to.</p>

thought, shrugs.</p>

<p><strong>ursula</strong>: No. She hands back his sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Keep them.</p>
<p><strong>73 ext. mud pit - dusk</strong>: Two TEAMS of harvesters have
a tug of war. The losers are dragged through a pit of mud. Cradling
handfuls of slime, they chase the winners off into the dusk.</p>
<p><strong>74 bill and abby - duski</strong>: Bill finds Abby sitting
off by herself, wanting no part of the festivities. This is the first
time since their arrival in Texas we have seen her wearing a dress.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sunny Jim, look at this. My first ice cream in
six months. And the lady even asks do I want sprinkles on top, thank
you. Big, deep dish of ice cream. You couldn’t pay me to leave this
place, Got you one, too. You should’ve heard the line I had to give her,
though. Oowee!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Good, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Now you’re trying to coax me. You never used
to act like this. Bill throws down the bowls of ice cream. In the
distance, some MEN compete at throwing a sledge hammer.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: For as long as I can remember, people been
giving me a hard time about one thing or another. Don’t you start in,
too!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You want to turn me into a whore?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We don’t have to decide anything final now.
Just if we’re going to stay. You never have to touch him if you don’t
feel like it. Minute you get fed up, we take off. Worst that can happen
is we had it soft for a while.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Something’s made you mean. She walks off,
uncertain what Bill really wants.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Or else we can forget it. I’m not going to
spend the whole afternoon on this, though. That I’m not going to do.</p>

ONE PERSON rolls a flaming wheel down a hill. ANOTHER sets off a string

hogsheads out of a pit of hot coals. The YOUNGER MEN tease her. She is

to suggest he still has the prudence he long since has abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: There’s work for them, too.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. bonfire - dusk.</strong>: A bonfire burns like a huge
eye in the vat of the prairie night. The band strikes up a reel. Chuck
and Abby lead the dancing off, as though to celebrate their agreement.
Their giant shadows dance with them. Soon the other harvesters join
in.</p>
<p><strong>81 tight on bill - dusku</strong>: Bill watches Abby dance–it
almost seems in farewell to their innocence. After a moment he turns off
into the night.I</p>
<p><strong>82 montage - night_</strong>: The effigy is held over the
flame at the end of a pole until it catches fire. The harvesters prance
around in the dark, trading it from hand to hand. The MUSICIANS, drunk
and happy, bow their hearts out.</p>
<p><strong>83 tight on bill - dawn</strong>: While the others pursue
their merriment, Bill walks the fields by himself, trembling with grief
and indecision. Dawn is breaking. The eastern sky glows like a forge.
Suddenly he comes upon a wolf. He catches his breath. The wolf stares
back at him for a moment, then turns and pads off into the stubble.</p>
<p><strong>84 ext. railroad tracks - dawneext. railroad tracks -
dawnu</strong>: Early the next morning the HARVESTERS wander by the
hundreds down to the railroad tracks to catch a train for the North,
where the crops are just now coming into maturity. A subtle feeling of
sadness pervades the group. Bill gives his sword cane away to a MAN who
seems to have admired it. The MAN offers him money, but he declines
it.</p>
<p><strong>85 ext. train - ursula and john - later</strong>: Ursula says
goodbye to her favorite, a redhead named JOHN. She is hoarse, as
always.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why don’t you come with us?</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: They won’t let me. So when am I going to see
you again?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe in Cheyenne. She nods okay. They both
know they will never see each other again. On a sudden impulse she gives
him a love note.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s this? She takes it back immediately,
but he snatches it away from her and, after a brief, giggling scuffle,
hops aboard the train, now picking up speed. Ursula runs along behind,
cursing and throwing rocks at him.</p>
<p><strong>86 tight on bill and abby</strong>: Bill and Abby look
on.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I told her, “none of my business Urs, I just
hope you’re not rolling around with some redhead is all.” She looks me
over. “Why?” she says, “What’ve you guys got that redheads don’t?” I
pity that kid. Ursula runs up and throws herself tearfully into Abby’s
arms.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s the matter? What’d he do? Bill starts
off after the train.</p>
<p><strong>87 ext.-“sheep power”</strong>: Abby tends a washing machine
driven by a sheep on a treadmill. Chuck watches from the front steps of
the Belvedere.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m just about done with this.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: So what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Next?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: There’s nothing else you want done?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Not that I can think of. Not right now. Miss
Carter, the housekeeper, steps out on the porch and pours a bucket of
milk into a cream separator.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How about the cream?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: She takes care of that. He nods at Miss
Carter, who conspicuously lets the screen door clap shut as she goes
back inside. She misses no opportunity to express her disdain for these
newcomers. She and Benson are the only employees seen at the Belvedere.
Several dozen others have stayed on after the harvest but they keep to
their quarters down at the dorm.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You mean I’m done for today?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Something else might come up. In truth, Chuck
does not want to see Abby degraded by menial labor, considering her more
a guest than an employee. They look at each other. Abby does not know
quite what to make of him</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well, I’m going back to the dorm.</p>
<p><strong>chucku</strong>: Is everything okay down there? In the way of
accommodations, I mean.U She nods and waves goodbye.I</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. barn</strong>: Down by the barn Bill teaches Chuck
how to shoot dice. Chuck feigns interest.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I like to gamble, and I like to win. I make no
bones about it. Got to where the guys on Throop Street wouldn’t even lag
pennies with me on account of I was such a winner. I’m starting out
level with you, you understand.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Have you ever been in trouble with the law?
Bill looks around. Abby would think it impolitic of him to speak so
openly with Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>billi</strong>: Nothing they could make stick. My problem has
always been not having the education. I bullshitted my way into school.
They gave me a test. It was ridiculous. I got in fights. Ended up paying
for a window. They threw me out. Don’t blame them either. Still, I
wanted to make something of myself. I mean, guys look at you across a
desk, you know what they’re thinking. So I went in the mill. Couldn’t
wait to get in there. Begin at seven, got to have a smile on your face.
Didn’t work out, though. No matter what you do, sometimes things just
don’t go right. It gets to you after a while. It gives you that feeling,
“Oh hell, what’s the use?” My dad told me, forget what the people around
you are doing. You got enough to worry about without considering what
somebody else does. Otherwise you get fouled up. He used to say “All you
got is this.” Only one day you wake up, find you’re not the smartest guy
in the world, never going to come up with the big score. I really
believed when I was growing up that somehow I would. I worked like a
bastard in that mill. I felt all right about it, though. I felt that
somewhere along the line somebody would see I had that special gleam.
“Hey, you, come over here.” So then I’d go. They are silent for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>chucki</strong>: You seem close to your sister._</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah. We’ve been together since we were kids.
You like her, don’t you? She likes you, too. Chuck looks down, feeling
transparent in the pleasure he takes at this news.</p>
<p><strong>89 tight on abby</strong>: The camera moves back to reveal
Abby listening in from the other side of the barn. Her eyes are full of
tears. How can Bill prize her so lightly? BILL Don’t get the wrong idea,
though.</p>
<p><strong>90 isolated on bill - lateri</strong>: Bill sits on the
ground reading his Police Gazette. Abby walks up and without a word of
explanation, slaps him. He jumps up and protests but quickly tapers off.
She turns on her heel and leaves.U Bill sits down feeling misunderstood
and abused. Does she think all this pleases him? 1</p>
<p><strong>91 ext. fairy rings</strong>: Chuck, out for a stroll with
Abby and Ursula, shows them a fairy ring–a colony of mushrooms growing
in a circle thirty feet across.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: I heard you farmers were big and dumb. You
aren’t so big. Where do they learn how to?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: They’re so darling! Can you eat them? Chuck
nods. Abby snaps the mushrooms off flush at the ground. The music
underscores this moment. She smiles at Chuck as she eats the dark earthy
flesh.</p>
<p><strong>92 ext. post</strong>: They pitch rocks at a post and
exchange intimacies. Abby has grown more lively.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You know sometimes I think there might have
been a mixup at the hospital where I. was born and that I could actually
be the interesting daughter of some big financier. Nobody would actually
know.I Are you in love with me, Chuck, or why are you always so
nervous?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Maybe I am. I must be.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why? On account of something I’ve done?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Because you’re so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What a nice thing to say. Look, I hit it. Did
you see? She goes right on with their game, as though she attached no
great importance to his momentous declaration.</p>
<p><strong>93 tight on chuck and abby - lateri</strong>: Chuck takes
Abby’s hand for the first time. Abby, startled, gives him a gentle
smile, then lets go.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What about my shoes? Aren’t they
pretty?U94EXT. SWING</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. swing</strong>: Bill sits in a swing and plays a
clarinet. The music flows out across the fields like a night breeze from
the city. Abby, passing by, glowers at him, as though to ask if things
are going along to his satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>95 astronomical sights</strong>: Jupiter, the Crab Nebula,
the canals of Mars, etc. CHUCK It turns out that people might have built
them. Does that surprise you? ABBY U No.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. ridge - dawn</strong>: They are on a ridge opposite
the Belvedere looking at the heavens through Chuck’s telescope. Abby
tingles with a sense of wonder. Chuck has opened a whole new world to
her.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You know so much! Would you bring my sister up
here and tell her some of this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>97 ext. father’s grave - night</strong>: Nearby the grave of
Chuck’s father stands in helpless witness to Abby’s deception. A
cottonwood tree rises against the cold blue sky, still as a statue.</p>
<p><strong>98 tight on book - flashback</strong>: A hand turns the pages
of a book from Chuck’s childhood. The text and VOICE reading it are in
Russian, the picture of Russian wood folk and animals.</p>
<p><strong>99 ext. virgin prairie - flashback</strong>: Chuck’s father
rushes around marking off his property with stakes.</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. unfinished sod house - flashback</strong>: Chuck,
ten years old, scours up the blade of a scythe. Family effects – a big
green stove, a bird cage, a table stacked with melons and a mirror–stand
waiting in front of their half-finished sod house. We see no sign of
Chuck’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>101 ext. plowed field - flashback</strong>: A plow folds back
the earth. The roots of the prairie grass twang like harp strings. The
plowing done, his father sows the seed. Poverty requires that for a
harrow he drag a tree branch in back of his ox. Over his shoulder he
carries a rifle. Chuck blows a horn to chase the blackbirds off the
seed. A scarecrow is rigged to his back, to make him more
intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>102 chuck and father - flashback</strong>: Chuck’s father has
caught smallpox. His face is covered with sores. Chuck wants to embrace
him, but the father wards him off with a long stick as he passes on some
last instructions in Russian.</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. river - flashback</strong>: The father stands on a
ledge above the river, filling his pockets with rocks to weight him
down.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: My father caught smallpox when I was eleven.
I fished him out of the river and buried him myself.</p>
<p><strong>104 ext. sand bar - flashback</strong>: Chuck drags his
father’s drowned body across a sand bar with a rope.</p>
<p><strong>105 ext. father’s grave - flashback</strong>: Chuck heaps the
last bit of earth on his father’s grave. The stove stands as a marker.
ABBY So who raised you? CHUCK Nobody. Did it myself.</p>
<p><strong>106 chuck as boy - with coyote, indians - flashback</strong>:
Famished, Chuck eats from the carcass of a coyote. Some INDIANS watch
him from a ridge. ABBY From the time you were a kid? How?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Worked hard, didn’t fool around. I never saw
a city. Never had time. All I ever did is work. He digs a post hole with
a shovel twice his size.</p>
<p><strong>107 pan over hills-dawn</strong>: The camera pans across
Chuck’s vast domain. CHUCK I gave my life to that land. But what do I
really have now? It’ll still be here when I’m gone. It won’t remember
me. I’d give it all up for you. I could make you happy, too, I think-if
only you’d trust me. The camera settles on Ursula, playing with a dog on
a seesaw Chuck has built her, then begins to move again, to a long shot
of Chuck and Abby on the ridge by the telescope. Chuck is proposing.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. dorm</strong>: Abby has told him of the proposal.
Bill broods over an unlit cigarette. Is this a great blessing or a great
misfortune which has befallen them?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He’s asked me to marry him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I never really thought he would.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I thought you wanted me to.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Before I did. You cold? Abby is shivering.
Bill takes off his jacket and slips it over her shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’re you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: We’ve never done anything like this.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who’d know but you and me?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s it, Ab. That’s all that matters, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You talk like it was all right. It would be a
crime.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But to give him what he wants more than
anything? Two, threeI months of sunshine? He’ll never get to enjoy his
money anyway. What’re you talking about? We’d be showing him the first
good times of his life.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Maybe you’re right. At each hint of consent
from Abby, Bill feels he must press on.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know what they’re going to stick on his
tombstone? “Born like a fool, worked like a mule.” Two lines. Abby
cannot say the proposal is devoid of principle. The idea of easing
Chuck’s imminent death gives them just the shade of a good motive. This
would be a trade.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What makes you think we’re just talking about
a couple of months?U</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Listen, the man’s got one foot on a banana
peel and the other on a roller skate. What can I say? We’ll be gone
before theI President shows up. He straightens his coat and smooths back
his hair, to make her smile, without success. BILL Hey, I know how you
feel. II Hey, I know how you feel. I feel just as bad. Like I was
sticking an icepick in my heart. Makes me sick just to think about it!
heart. Makes me sick just to</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I held out a long time. I could’ve taken the
first guy with a gold watch, but I held out. I told myself that when I
found somebody, I’d stick by him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I know. We’re in quicksand, though. We stand
around, it’s going to suck us down like everybody else. Somewhere along
the line you have to make a sacrifice. Lots of people want to sit back
and take a piece without doing nothing. He waits to see how she will
respond. Half of him wants her to turn him down flat. Abby is
bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Have I ever complained? Have I said anything
that would make you think…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You don’t have to. I hate it when I see you
stooped over and them looking at your ass like you were a whore. I
personally feel ashamed! I want to take a .45 and let somebody have it.
We got to look on the bright side of this, Ab. Year from today we got a
Chinese butler and no shit from anybody. Some people need more’n they
have, some have more’n they need. It’s just a matter of getting us all
together. I don’t even know if I believe what I’m saying, though. I feel
like we’re on the edge of a big cliff. Abby looks at the ground for a
moment, then nods.</p>
<p><strong>109 tight on chuck</strong>: Chuck lies in bed,
daydreaning.</p>
<p><strong>110 tight on abby and ursula</strong>: Ursula decorates
Abby’s hair with flowers and tells her how pretty she looks.</p>
<p><strong>111 ext. river bank</strong>: The wedding takes place along
the river. The Preacher has come back with his ACOLYTES. A chest of
drawers serves as the altar. Benson is the best man–a joyless one.
Ursula bounces around in a beautiful gown, looking for the first time
like a young woman. The BAND practically outnumbers the guests: ELDERS
from the local Mennonites, the MAYORS of a few surrounding towns decked
out in sashes and medals, etc.</p>
<p><strong>112 tight on abby and bill</strong>: Bill kisses the bride on
the cheek. Each believes she is going through with this for the other’s
sake. They whisper back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You know what this means, don’t you? We won’t
ever let each other down, will we?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I love you more than ever. I always will. I
couldn’t do this unless I loved you.</p>
<p><strong>113 series of angles</strong>: The Acolytes ring an angelus
bell. Chuck slips a sapphire on her finger. The Preacher, with
outstretched arms, reminds them all that they are witness to a great
event.</p>
<p><strong>114 sky - abby’s pov</strong>: Abby, frightened, looks off at
the rolling sky, wondering how all thislooks in the sight of heaven.</p>
<p><strong>115 int. bedroom - dusk</strong>: From her pillow, Abby
watches Chuck shyly enter the bedroom He comes over and sits down beside
her</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re wonderful. She is silent for a moment.
The wind moans in the rafter</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No. But I wish I were. Listen. It sounds like
the ocean. They smile at each other.</p>
<p><strong>116 ext. belvedere - duski</strong>: Bill watches the lights
go out in the Belvedere. A lump rises to his throat. How exactly did
this happen? He sets his jaw, vowing not to give way to weakness or
jealousy. This is the price they have to pay for a lasting
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>117 tight on abby, chuck, etc.</strong>: The next morning the
newlyweds set off on their honeymoon. Chuck tells Bill to move his
things from the dorm into the Belvedere. Abby, a basket of cucumbers
under her arm, waves goodbye, angling her wrist so that Bill and Ursula
can see the diamond bracelet Chuck has given her.</p>
<p><strong>118 ext. prairiei</strong>: They steer out across the prairie
in a1912 Overland auto. Ursula runs after them, slaps the back fender
and hops around on one foot, pretending the other was run over. Abby
laughs. She knows this stunt. When they are gone Ursula turns fiercely
on Bill.U</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What for? Don’t be any more of a pain in the
neck than you gotta be, okay? She swings at him with her fist. He pushes
her away._</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You think I like this? I’m doing it for
her!</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: You scum. Bill slaps her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Still think so? She throws a rock at him and
runs off. He catches her, repenting of his meanness.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I know you can’t understand this, but there’s
nothing I want except good things for Abby and you. Go ahead and hit me
back. She hesitates a second, then slaps him as hard as she can. Blood
glistens on his lip. He does not say a word in protest. She looks at the
wound, horrified, then throws her arms tight around him.</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. pieri</strong>: Abby and Chuck disembark from a
paddleboat steamer at a pier along the river. Chuck looks excited.</p>
<p><strong>120 ext. yellowstone pool</strong>: Chuck and Abby have gone
to Yellowstone Park for their honeymoon. Abby wades in a pool, wreathed
by mists from the underworld. She carries a parasol to protect her from
the sun. The trees in the vicinity are bare of leaves.</p>
<p><strong>121 ext. antlers - freeze frame</strong>: Chuck kneels with a
box camera to photograph a large pair of antlers lying on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>122 series of stills</strong>: This photo becomes the first
in a series from their Yellowstone trip: fishermen displaying
sensational catches by a river, buggies vying with early autos on rutted
roads, the giant Beaupre who stood eight feet tall, etc. Each of the
pictures bears a caption. Together they make a little story. ABBY We saw
grizzly bears and a boar. The bears scared me the most. They eat
garbage. I was so lonesome. I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>123 tight on bill and abby</strong>: Bill and Abby kiss,
renewing old ties.U</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: There was a mountain partly made of glass,
too, but we didn’t get to see it. And a petrified tree.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ll go back.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Can we? Because there’s a whole lot I didn’t
get to see. Bill straightens up. Chuck sits down on Abby’s other
side.</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. dinner table under neti</strong>: They are having
dinner on the lawn in front of the Belvedere. A fine mesh net is spread
above them like a tent to keep the insects out. Ursula sits on Bill’s
lap. He puts a hand up the back of her shirt and they play as though she
were a ventriloquist’s dummy.</p>
<p><strong>125 tight on rabbit</strong>: Bill displays a rabbit which he
trained in their absence to perform a card trick. BILL I have you now,
Ed. Only thing that can beat me is the ace of spades. Her name’s
Abigail. Hungarian name. Andrew drew Ann. Ann drew Andrew. From the
whole of a spread deck it picks the ace of spades.</p>
<p><strong>126 new angle</strong>: Abby and Chuck applaud. Ursula cranks
up the victrola and puts on a record. Bill strokes the rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know why I like him? He minds his business
and isn’t full of baloney. Chuck turns to Abby and, for nearly the first
time, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: He’s funny. Bill holds a plate up for Abby to
see. Limoges china. Abby rolls her eyes and spits out a cherry pit. They
eat like pigs, with no respect for bourgeois manners.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: You have any talents, Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: No, but I admire people who do.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: That’s not so. He can do a duck. Show
them.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Stand back. Get the women and children
someplace safe. Chuck, feeling it would be wrong not to enter the spirit
of the occasion, does his imitation. The likeness is astonishing. Abby
wipes a bit of food off his chin with her napkin. Bill drums on the
table with his spoon.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You saw how modest he was?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How’d you get along so long without a woman?
Chuck shrugs. Ursula makes a gesture as though to say by masturbating.
Chuck does not see it. Billy laughs. Abby slaps her. The rabbit jumps
out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Don’t you ever behave that way at table! She’s
adopted. I had nothing to do with her upbringing. I’d trade her off for
a yellow dog. Now eat. You want to starve to death?</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: That’s what you’d like. Abby, overcome with
impatience, throws her food to the dogs. Ursula catches a grasshopper
and holds it out to Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: You give me a quarter to eat this hopper?
Chuck does not reply. She pops it into her mouth anyway, enjoying his
look of shock. Bill throws down his fork.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: All right, okay, nobody’s hungry anymore.
What’s the worst thing you ever did, Chuck? Besides missing church and
that kind of stuff. Chuck thinks about this.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Once I turned a man out in the middle of
winter, without a cent of pay. For all I know he froze.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If you went that far, he must’ve deserved it.
What else?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: He didn’t. I fired him out of resentment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, you’re the boss, right? That’s how it
works. Got to make decisions on the spot. Anyway, this guy-what’s his
name?–if I know his kind, which I do, he’s probably doing okay for
himself, got a hand in somebody else’s pocket for a change. Is that
all?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: All I can think of right now. How about
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He wants to know. I’m not going to count
setting Blackie’s on fire either. He had it coming. BILL Once I punched
a guy while he was asleep. Chuck looks surprised. Bill glances at Abby,
worried that he might have said too much.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I was just kidding. Actually a guy I know did,
though.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Maybe he did it to you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah. I think so. Chuck gets up to ring for
Miss Carter. Bill looks him up and down. Chuck, though older, is
physically more imposing.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Can I have the rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Get serious. I can win money with him. She
licks his ear. He laughs.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: I want that bunny.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You still believe in Santa Claus. Bill closes
his eyes as he feels the soft fur of the rabbit. Ursula looks around to
make sure Chuck is gone, then wings a roll at Bill. It bounces off his
forehead. He retaliates with a pat of butter.</p>
<p><strong>127 benson</strong>: Benson watches from another hill. He
finds his displacement by these newcomers a humiliating injustice.</p>
<p><strong>128 new angle</strong>: Chuck returns to the table and draws
Bill aside.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Almost forgot. Here’s your pay. Bill takes
the envelope Chuck holds out. Then, in a spasm of conscience, he gives
it back.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: hat’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I got no right to.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Why? Bill is momentarily at a loss for
words.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I haven’t worked hard enough to deserve it. I
been goofing off.I</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Give it to charity or something. Don’t worry.
I always know to look out for myself, because ifI I don’t, who will? See
what I’m driving at? Chuck sees a sense of honor at work in Bill here,
and though he considers the gesture misguided and a little grand,
admires him for it.</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. basesu</strong>: They play a game with big lace
pillows for bases. The rules are unintelligible.</p>
<p><strong>130 new angle</strong>: Bill is expert at throwing knives. As
the others watch, he goes into a big windup and pins a playing card to
the side of the house.U Everyone seems happy and congenial. They have
reached some kind of plateau. Chuck’s ignorance of the ruse does not
cause the others to treat him with less respect. They seem themselves
almost to have forgotten it.</p>
<p><strong>131 bill and abby’s pov - lateru</strong>: Benson collects
the bases, a job he doubtless feels is beneath him. The Doctor’s wagon,
unmistakable even at such a great distance, thunders away from the
Belvedere.</p>
<p><strong>132 tight on bill and abbyu</strong>: Bill and Abby, waiting
for Chuck to join them for a swim,U look questioningly at each
other.S</p>
<p><strong>133 ext. river</strong>: Ursula, in her bathing suit, jumps
from a ledge above the river. She holds a big umbrella over her to see
if it will act as a parachute. Bill and Chuck have a water fight. Abby
wades in the shallows with a parasol.</p>
<p><strong>134 tight on abby and ursula - later</strong>: Abby is
teaching Ursula how to kiss.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Too like a mule.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: What about that?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It’s got to be–how should I say?– more
relaxed. They laugh and kiss again.</p>
<p><strong>135 new angle</strong>: Farther up the slope Bill and Chuck
wring out their bathing suits. Bill, thinking of the Doctor’s visit,
puts a hand on Chuck’s shoulder. This time Chuck does not stiffen or
ease it off.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Sure. Why? Bill shrugs, beaming with
admiration for this man who does not burden others with his secrets.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I appreciate everything you’ve done for Abby.
I really do. You’ve given her all the things she always deserved. I got
to admit you have. Chuck looks off, embarrassed but oddly pleased. Bill
snatches up a handful of weeds and smells them. .</p>
<p><strong>136 crane shot</strong>: Returning home they portray the
movements of the sun, earth and moon relative to each other. Abby is the
sun and keeps up a steady pace across the prairie. Chuck, the earth,
circles her at a trot, giving instructions. Bill, with the most
strenuous role of all–the moon– runs around Chuck while he circles
Abby.</p>
<p><strong>137 ext. prairie - series of angles</strong>: They play golf
on the infinite fairway of the prairie. Bill and Abby make a team
against Chuck and Ursula. Nightingales call out like mermaids from the
sea.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You liking it here? Feel good? Feels good to
feel good. He smiles, satisfied that he has done well by her, and lets a
new ball slip down his pant leg to replace the one he played.</p>
<p><strong>138 new angle</strong>: Ursula, meanwhile, grinds Abby’s ball
into the dirt with the heel of her boot. She winks at Chuck. Chuck
smiles back.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s your mother like?</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Her? Like somebody that just got hit on the
head. She used to pray for me. Rosary, the stations, everything. “Hey,
Ma,” I tell her, “I ain’t crippled.” They don’t know, though. They say
you’re in trouble. They don’t know. My dad, the same way. Thought the
world owed him a living. He drowned in Lake Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>139 ext. belvedere</strong>: They walk home. Bill stays
behind to work on his strokes. Ursula sends the dogs after the
balls.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You shag them, not those dogs. They might
choke or run off with them.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Who made you the boss? Shag them
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Listen, some day all this is going to be mine.
Or half is. Somebody like that, you want to get on his good side, not
give him a lot of gas. You want to do what he says. He steps off a few
paces of his future kingdom and draws a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This reminds me of where I came from. I left
when I was six. That’s when I met your sister. He looks at the land with
a new sense of reverence. He snatches up a handful of grass and rolls it
between his palms.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I can’t wait to go back to Chicago, bring them
down for a visit. Blackie and them. There’s a lot of satisfaction in
showing up people who thought you’d never amount to anything. I’d really
like to see this place run right. I got a lot of ideas I’d like to try
out.</p>
<p><strong>140 bill’s pov and tight on bill</strong>: In the distance he
sees Chuck put his arm on Abby’s waist and whisper something in her ear.
This intimacy rubs him the wrong way. He gives his clubs to Ursula and
starts after them.</p>
<p><strong>141 int. kitchen</strong>: Bill finds them in the kitchen.
Chuck goes into the other room to look for something. Abby lifts the
cigarette out of Bill’s mouth, takes a drag and does a French inhale.
Bill kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Nobody’s all bad, are they?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I met a few I was wrong on, then. Suddenly
they hear Chuck’s footsteps. They pull back just in time, Abby returning
the cigarette to him behind her back. They chat as though nothing had
happened.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I have a headache. I probably should’ve worn a
hat. Abby rolls her eyes at this improvisation. No sooner does Chuck
turn his back than Bill’s hand darts out to touch her breast. He
snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back. Together they walk
into the living room.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You ever see anybody out here?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Not after harvest.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How often do you get into town?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Once or twice a year.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re kidding. He must be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Why do I need to? Bill catches Abby’s eyes.
He frowns at the idea of being cooped up with this Mormon all
winter.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Relaxation. Look at the girls. Opportunity to
see how other folks live. Chuck looks at him blankly. None of these
reasons seems to carry much weight for him. Bill turns to Abby.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Somebody is nuts. I don’t know whether it’s
him or me, but somebody is definitely nuts.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why don’t I fix tea?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe I should help you. He follows her back
into the kitchen, where he starts to kiss her. She pushes him away and
turns to making the tea.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re worse than an Airedale. You want
jasmine or mint? CHUCK Mint. Bill lifts up the back of her dress and
looks under it, testing the breadth of his license. She slaps it back
down. He lifts it again, standing on his right to. She glowers at
him.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Don’t do that. How much sugar?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why not? I’m just seeing what kind of material
it’s made of. CHUCK One spoonful. Bill walks around absentmindedly,
inspecting Chuck’s things, stealing whatever catches his fancy. A book,
a paperweight, a bell–things he does not really want and has no use for.
His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse
these little sins. As Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a
candlestick.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Where’s the candlestick? Chuck shrugs. Bill
gives Abby a cold look and goes outside.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: He’s a strange one.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Once he named his shoes like they were pets.
It was a joke, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. well</strong>: Bill drops the candlestick down the
well, stands for a moment, then punches the bucket with his fist. He
looks up. Benson has seen him.</p>
<p><strong>143 ext. saplings against window - night</strong>: Outside
the saplings thrash in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>144 int. bedroom - night</strong>: Abby wakes up with a
gasp.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I had a dream.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What about? Was something after you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I forgot it already.</p>
<p><strong>145 aerial shot</strong>: The camera falls through the clouds
as though in a lost fragment of Abby’s dreams.</p>
<p><strong>146 ext. barn</strong>: Benson sulks by the barn. Chuck
approaches him.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You come down here a lot, don’t you? Always
when you’re mad. You never change.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: It might not be my place to say this, sir,
but I don’t think they’re honest people.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: He gets on your nerves, doesn’t he? He always
has. Now don’t say something you’re going to regret. .</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Why should I regret it? I think they’re a
pair of scam artists, sir. Let me tell you what I’ve seen, and you judge
for yourself. Chuck, who of course has seen the same things and more,
raises a hand to silence him.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Maybe you’d be happier taking over the north
end till spring. I don’t say this in anger. We’ve been together a long
time, and I’ve always felt about you like, well, close. It just might
work out better is all. Less friction.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Don’t believe me, then. You shouldn’t. But
why not check it out, sir? Hire a detective in Chicago. It won’t cost
much. What’s there to lose? Chuck’s brow darkens as Benson goes on. For
a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke
up. Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge
it.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re talking about my wife. And so Chuck,
too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Maybe I better pack my things. Benson turns
and walks off. Chuck watches him go, ashamed at himself. What has this
man done but a friend’s duty?</p>
<p><strong>147 int. master bedroom</strong>: Abby sits at the dresser in
the master bedroom. Bill walks in through the door and tries Chuck’s hat
on for size.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’re you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just walked in through the door, like any
other white man. On the bureau he finds a pistol. He aims it out the
window. All this will soon be theirs!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Smith and Wesson. You ought to see one of
these plow into a watermelon. She holds a hairbrush out for him to see.
He looks it over and gives it back without comment. He finds a stain on
the tabletop.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Somebody’s been staining this fake inlay with
a water glass. Actually I don’t blame them. He walks around trying out
more of Chuck’s appurtenances. Abby, caught up, models a shawl before an
imaginary mirror. She blows a kiss at herself.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Don’t say I did that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The bed should be over next to the window.
Where the view is. Bill is already making plans for life after Chuck’s
demise.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe we build on a balcony. First the birds
go. The peacocks are crowing outside. They burst out laughing. Bill
checks the mussed bedsheets.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: That doesn’t concern you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why not? Look, I know you’ve got urges. It
wouldn’t be right if you didn’t. Abby stands up, angry.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You think I enjoy it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Lower your voice.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You act like it’s harder on you than me! I
never want to talk about this again. Bill, consoled, holds an eyelet
blouse against the light.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I bet he enjoys looking at you in this.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I thought you liked it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He likes it, too, is what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well, it’s the style.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What do you want me to wear in this heat? A
blanket?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s your problem. Abby puts on her wedding
bracelet and admires it. Bill softens at the sight of her beauty,
properly adorned.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I told you someday we’d be living in style.
When this whole thing is over I’m going to buy you a necklace with
diamonds as big as that. He holds out the tip of his little finger. They
laugh, as though they suddenly felt the absurdity of all this
make-believe.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re cute. Maybe a shade too cute. She
touches his face sympathetically, as though to say that she knows the
pain this was causing him.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: This is terrible for us both. CHUCK Abby? They
jump as Chuck calls up from downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Down in a minute. She kisses Bill.</p>
<p><strong>148 ext. back door of belvedere</strong>: Bill sneaks out the
back door of’ the Belvedere, only to find Benson drinking at the well.
They look at each other in silence for a moment. Benson’s horse stands
beside him, a suitcase fixed to the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: I know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: That boy’s like a son to me. Don’t you
forget it. I know what you’re doing. Benson gets on his horse, turns and
rides off. Miss Carter waves goodbye from the side of the house. She and
Bill exchange a look.</p>
<p><strong>149 ext. front porch</strong>: Bill finds the others around
front. Abby lolls in the hammock writing in her diary and eating a
peach. Ursula plays the guitar. Little by little the newcomers have done
the house over from the austere structure that it was. Living room
furniture has been moved out onto the front lawn and there arranged as
though by a child. Goats sleep on the divan. Archery targets hang from
the side of the house. The porch is covered with a striped awning, bird
cages and twirls of bunting. Everywhere an atmosphere of drunken ease
prevails.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nice fall day.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Wish I’d said that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Watcha doing?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Eating a green peach. ’Spect to die any
minute.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Listen, I had a great idea. Let’s spend
Christmas in Chicago. Break up the old routine. Rhino’s never been to a
baseball game or a horse race. I know guys one month off the boat that
have. Don’t even speak the English language, but they eat it right up.
You’re just a young guy, Rhino; you oughta be running around raising
hell. No offense to the little woman. He bows apologetically to Abby.
She pinches a dead leaf off a plant.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Abby says that in the poor section people eat
cats.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did you, sis? Well, there’s always something
doing. I can’t begin to tell you. State and Madison? Mmmm. Lights
everywhere. You’d love it.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: It can be rough, though.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Rough? Listen, you can’t walk down the street
without somebody reaching in your pocket! You’ve got to keep your coat
like this and poke them away.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Bill got shot once. The bullet’s still in
him.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Doctor said he took it out, but I never saw
it. Hurt like a bastard. You got no idea how it hurt. Suddenly he
worries this might discourage Chuck from going.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They won’t mess with you, though. Big fella
like you. I can see it now. He offers a taste of the talk Chuck is like
to provoke on the street corners.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: “Hey, hey, hey. Who’s this here, fresh out of
the African Jungle, moving down the sidewalk with a whowhowho, taking
ten feet at a step and making all the virgins run for cover? Why, it’s
Big Rhino, the King of Beasts. He walks, he talks, he sucks up chalk.”
Bill steps back and sees, as though for the first time, how imposing
Chuck really is.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You are big, aren’t you? Sunny Jim! You
must’ve had a real moose for an old lady.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Take it easy. But Chuck holds none of this
against him. He knows it comes from respect.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So what do you say? What a sorry outfit! Bunch
of old ladies. You better stay behind. Your mammas’d probably get upset.
But when the time comes, I’m out of here. Hit the road, Toad! Ursula
passes the sandwiches around until there is just one left, Miss
Carter’s. While the others are talking, she scoops up a handful of dirt
and pours it into the middle. Bill, lighting a cigarette, notices
Chuck’s hand on Abby’s.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Ever seen a match burn twice?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: No. Bill blows out the match and touches
Chuck’s hand with the hot ember, causing him to yank it away.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s old. Chuck starts to cough. Bill looks
at Abby, then whips the handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over
his nose, as though to keep from getting Chuck’s germs. Miss Carter’s
face goes blank as she bites into her sandwich. She jumps up and rushes
back into the house. Chuck frowns. Bill glares at Ursula, then turns to
Chuck and, referring to the dead prairie grass which runs through the
front yard right up to the house, continues:</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You ever thought of putting in some fescue
here? Some fescue grass? Of course, it might not take in this soil.
Chuck stands up and winds a stole, a long religious scarf, around his
neck.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I still have a little of this sore throat.
Where you going, though?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: To kill a hog.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s the necktie for? Or does it just come
in handy?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Keeps the stain of guilt off. Chuck nods
goodbye and walks off, taking a stool with him. Bill sighs with
admiration.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I try and try.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What a splendid person! I’ve never met anybody
like him!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Splendid people make you nervous.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: They do! I breathe a sigh of relief when they
step outside the room. Bill puts on his boater and opens a copy of the
Police Gazette. They are silent for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: A guy ate a brick on a bet. Must of busted it
up first with a hammer. Guy in New York City. Where else? Anybody want
to bet me I can’t stick this knife in that post? Nobody takes him up on
this. Abby leafs through the Sears catalogue, her mind dancing with
visions of splendor.</p>
<p><strong>150 tight on catalogue</strong>: Pictured. in the catalogue
are bath oils and corsets and feathered hats. A grasshopper is perched
on the page among them, its eyes blank and dumb.</p>
<p><strong>151 tight on rose</strong>: Bill watches her run her finger
slowly around the closed heart of a rose. Suddenly they both look at
each other. They have heard the squeals, faint but unmistakable, of a
hog being led to slaughter.</p>
<p><strong>152 tight on stool - quick cut</strong>: Chuck has tied the
hog’s feet to the inverted legs of the stool.</p>
<p><strong>153 other quick cuts</strong>: Ursula, off by herself, skips
rope. A flag on the pole by the front gate snaps in the breeze. From the
branch of a lone tree the hog dangles by its hocks into the mouth of a
barrel.</p>
<p><strong>154 ext. belvedere - abby’s pov from second floor
window</strong>: Miss Carter storms down the hill with her bags. Fed up,
she is leaving the bonanza. Chuck tries in vain to appease her. She
keeps walking, out the front gate and into the prairie on a straight
course for the railroad tracks. Chuck will now be alone at the Belvedere
with the newcomers and no other point of reference.</p>
<p><strong>155 ext. clothes line</strong>: Later that afternoon, Bill
catches sight of Abby’s underthings rustling on the clothes line.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. stairs</strong>: That evening he watches her from
behind as she climbs the stairs to join Chuck at their bedroom door. She
nods goodnight, sensing the jealousy that is growing in him.</p>
<p><strong>157 int. master bedroom</strong>: Chuck looks impatiently
through a drawer.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I can’t find anything around here. Last week
it was my gloves; this week my talc. What’s going on? He stands and
watches Abby get ready for bed. She fills him with a deep adoration. He
feels that in the tulip of her mouth at last he has found heaven.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You don’t think my skin’s too fair? He comes
up behind her and touches her long hair.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re smart, too, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I know what the Magna Carta is.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Can I help you brush it out?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Not right now. She is cold to discourage false
expectations in him–and because she feels that she at least owes Bill
this. Chuck, however, assumes the fault must be his own. His naivete
about women, and the world in general, protects the conspirators–and
protects him, too, for he glimpses enough of the truth not to want to
know any more.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What makes you so distant with me?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Distant? I don’t mean to be.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You know what I’m talking about, though. You
aren’t that way with your brother.</p>
<p><strong>158 int.attic</strong>: Bill, eavesdropping in the attic
above them, surveys Chuck’s dusty heirlooms. CHUCK It must be something
I’m doing. I wish you’d tell me what, though.</p>
<p><strong>159 int. bedroom</strong>: These gentle endearments, so
rarely heard from Bill, stir her deeply. She throws herself in his
arms.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Oh, Chuck I Please forgive me. Does it mean
anything that I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: But I don’t blame you. Did I make it sound
that way?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You should. You have a right to.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: It’s just that sometimes I feel I don’t know
you well.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You don’t. It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I think you love me better than before,
though. She rubs her cheek against his hands. Daily she feels warmer
toward him. How much of this is love, how much respect or devotion, even
she cannot say.</p>
<p><strong>160 tight on bill - later - night</strong>: The night throbs
with crickets. Bill cracks open the bedroom door. Chuck lies asleep in a
shaft of moonlight next to Abby. He hesitates a moment, but a strange
compulsion drives him on. He has never done anything so dangerous, or
had so little idea why.</p>
<p><strong>161 int. bedroom - night</strong>: Abby wakes up to find him
staring her in the face. He kisses her. Chuck stirs. Abby signals they
should go outside.</p>
<p><strong>162 ext. belvedere - day for night</strong>: They sneak out
of the Belvedere. The night is warm.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re no good.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mmmm. But I love you.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I can’t stand it any more. This is just so
cruel. We’re both no good. I’ve got to get drunk with you, Bill. You
know what I mean? Drunk. Bill wags a bottle. The dogs, awakened, bay
from the kennel. They wait a moment to see if a light will go on in the
house, then dart off toward the fields. A plaster lawn dwarf seems to
watch them go.</p>
<p><strong>163 ext. fields - day for night</strong>: They run through
the fields, hand in hand, laughing and flirting. The moon makes Abby’s
nightgown a ghostly white.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: We can never do this again, though. Okay? It
really is too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This one night. He toes a sodden old shoe.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, I found a shoe.</p>
<p><strong>164 shoe, coyotes, scarecrow - day for night</strong>: The
shoe gleams in the moonlight. Coyotes yelp from the hilltops. A
scarecrow spreads its arms against the sky. The waving fields of wheat
have given way to vast reaches of cleanly shaven stubble, stained with
purple morning glories. Odd, large stakes are planted among them.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You want me to spin you around? She nods okay.
He takes her by the hands and spins her around the way he used to–until
they go reeling off, too dizzy to stand.</p>
<p><strong>166 ext. river bank - day for night</strong>: They lie by the
river looking at the great dome of stars. Bill wants to believe things
are the same between them as before. So does Abby–but she knows
better.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Suppose we woke up tomorrow and it was a
thousand years ago. I mean, with all we know? Electricity, the
telephone, radio, that kind of stuff. They’d never figure out how we
came up with it all. Maybe they’d kill us. She looks at him, and they
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You sleepy?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: This is the first time we slept together in a
while, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Kiss me, then.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It’s so sweet to be able to kiss you when I
want to.</p>
<p><strong>167 new angle</strong>: Before the marriage his lovemaking
was gentle and soft. Now it has a brutal air, as though he were
asserting his right to her for the last time.</p>
<p><strong>168 tight on abby - dawn</strong>: Dawn is breaking. Abby
jumps to her feet, alarmed. They have slept too long.</p>
<p><strong>169 ext. belvedere - dawn</strong>: They have run back to the
Belvedere. It seems they are safe until Chuck appears on the porch,
yawning and stretching. Bill drops to the ground while Abby goes ahead.
Abby appears at one side of the house while Bill steals around the
other. Luckily, they have come up from the back.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Abby! I’ve been looking all over for you.
Where have you been? While she distracts Chuck, Bill slips back in the
house. It has been a close call.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Watching the ducks.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Didn’t you sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>170 tight on abby</strong>: Abby looks sympathetically at
Chuck. Her face dissolves into a page of her diary and from there to
Ursula, balancing an egg on her fingertip. ABBY Chuck saw Ursula balance
an egg. He begged her to repeat this trick, but she wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>171 tight on chuck</strong>: Chuck tries to reduplicate
Ursula’s feat. Abby, amused, reaches out and touches his face. We wonder
if, despite herself, she might be falling in love with him.</p>
<p><strong>172 ext. belvedere</strong>: Bill watches the Doctor walk out
the front door and down the steps to his wagon. Chuck follows, smiling.
ABBY The Doctor came. Chuck looked pleased for a change.</p>
<p><strong>173 ext. prairie - bill’s pov</strong>: The Doctor’s wagon
rolls off across the prairie. ABBY Tomorrow the President passes
through. Plans have changed, and he can’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>174 ext. railroad tracks - dusk</strong>: They have come down
to the railroad tracks to watch the President pass through.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: We should have brought a flag.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Does she have time to ride back and get it?
Abby and Bill hold hands. Chuck by now is accustomed to such displays.
They seem, however, to make Abby increasingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>175 moving train - their povs</strong>: The train bursts past
at twenty yards, its great light rolling like a lunatic eye. Bill’s
heart pounds with excitement. Chuck holds Abby by the waist. Ursula
waves a handkerchief… They cannot make out anything specific in the
windows, but there is the sense of people going more important places,
getting on with the serious business of their lives - while out here
they stagnate. Dimly visible, on the back platform of the caboose, a MAN
in a frock coat salutes them with his cane. The train has quickly
vanished into the declining sun. Everything is quiet again. Ursula
rushes up the grade to collect some pennies she laid on the tracks.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Did you see him wave?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: He was shorter than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How do you know it was him?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I saw! He had a hat on.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You didn’t understand my question. They walk
back to the buggy. Ursula holds up a dead snake she found on the
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: You know what I’m going to do with this?
Take it home and put it in vinegar.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That was the President, shortie. Wake up. Bill
watches Chuck help Abby into the buggy. She is laughing about something
or other. His hand lingers for a moment on hers. She does not brush it
aside, as once she might have, but to Bill’s dismay, presses it against
her breast. Chuck seems to have breathed a hope into her that he, Bill,
was never able to.</p>
<p><strong>176 ext. fields</strong>: Abby and Ursula race across the
fields trying to fly a kite. Ursula rides a tiny Shetland pony. Just as
the wind lifts the kite away, they run into Bill. He sits by himself
observing a spear of grass. Abby drops off. Ursula rides off over the
hill with the kite, leaving her alone with Bill.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You look deep in thought. She touches his
cheek. He brushes her hand away.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: There’s nothing wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’re you so mad about then?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who said I was mad?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can’t I be alone once in a while without
everybody getting all worked up?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re the only person getting worked up. Some
buffalo appear on the crest of the next hill. Abby looks at them. They
do not seem quite part of this world but mythical, like minotaurs.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Chuck says they’re good for the grass. Stop
giving me that look.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You can’t keep your hands off him these
days.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I haven’t touched him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How about the other night? I saw you, Abby.
The other night by the tracks? If only you wouldn’t lie! Really, there’s
some things about you I’m never going to understand.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I forgot. Anyway it doesn’t matter. What are
you doing, always trying to trap me? Bill paces around, disgusted with
himself and the whole situation.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I can’t stand it any more. It’s just too
degrading. You and him. Why do I have to spell it out? I thought it
would be all over in a month or two. Guy might go another five years.
We’ve got to clear out, Abby. They stare at each other in silence for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why stop now? We’ve come this far.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why stay? Go ahead and tell me! I’m standing
here. Bill trembles with shock and anger. The buffalo cast aware glances
at them.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You want us to lose everything?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m telling you I can’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re weak then. What about all I’ve been
through? And what about him? It would be the worst thing we could do.
Worse than anything so far. It would break his heart. Bill is silent for
a moment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re getting to like him, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It would kill him. Leaving now would be just
cruel.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Would it? So what’s it matter to somebody in
his shape? In fact you’re just leaving us one way out.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’re you talking about? Murdering him?
Ursula comes riding over the hill, without the kite.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You watch and see.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: I had to let it go. One of them started
following me, and I threw a rock at him. I had a bunch stored in my
pocket. They take off running after her.</p>
<p><strong>177 ext. belvedere</strong>: As they approach the Belvedere,
Bill sees Chuck standing on the front steps. Suddenly angry, he draws
Abby to him and in plain view kisses her on the lips.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He can see you! Bill nods; he knows. Abby runs
ahead, angry and alarmed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t you believe in being honest?</p>
<p><strong>178 new angle</strong>: Abby bounds up the steps. Chuck has
bent his mind to understand all this as mere sibling love, but here is
the greatest test so far.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Aren’t you going to kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Today’s my birthday. Chuck gives her a kiss,
glad to put aside his suspicions.</p>
<p><strong>179 tight on pointers, quail and pheasants</strong>: Tails
level, their noses thrust high in the air, a pair of pointers prance
through the high uplands grass, following a scent like sailors taking in
a rope. Pheasants and quail tremble in their coveys, their eyes big with
fear.</p>
<p><strong>180 ext. uplands</strong>: Chuck has taken Bill out
bird-hunting. They wear heavy canvas leggings and carry shotguns.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did you ever tell Abby the buffalo help keep
up the grass?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I think so. Why? Bill shrugs. Chuck welcomes
this opportunity to speak of his wife. He considers Bill a good friend,
in fact the only person with whom he can talk about delicate
matters.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I want to get her something nice for
Christmas. Bill, who means to kill Chuck the first chance he gets,
forgets this intention for a moment to give him advice.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She likes to draw. Maybe some paints. Nothing
too expensive– she might want to exchange it. Maybe a coat. She likes to
show off sometimes. She’s sweet that way.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I wish I knew how to make her happy. Nothing
I do really seems to.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s how they are. They like to make you
work for it. I couldn’t ever figure out why. Sometimes you can’t go
wrong, though. You know that one Abby showed you a picture of?
Elizabeth? I took her cherry.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I know. You told me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Actually, I didn’t, but I could have. The
point I’m making is you’ve got to understand how they operate. Get them
thinking you can take it or leave it, you’re usually okay. Suddenly the
dogs stop rigid, on point. At Chuck’s hiss they sink into the grass.
Bill looks at Chuck’s exposed back. Nobody would know. It could be made
to seem like a hunting accident. He cocks the hammer of his shotgun. His
heart pounds wildly. Chuck talks in a low voice to the dogs. CHUCK All
right, put them up, girl. The dogs rise and inch toward the birds, as
slowly as the minute hand of a clock. All at once the quail explode out
of hiding. Bill jumps at the noise. Chuck fires twice. Two birds fall.
The retriever notes where. Chuck turns around.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Why aren’t you shooting? I left you those two
on the left.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They caught me off guard.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You have to keep your gun up. Chuck walks
ahead. The music builds a mood of tension. Bill takes a practice shot
into the ground. Bill looks around. There is nobody in sight. He turns
the sights on Chuck’s back. It would be simple enough. Though only
twenty feet away, he closes the gap, to make sure he does not miss.
Chuck whistles the scattered birds back to their covey. “Pheo! Pheo!”
Soon, faint and far away, comes a reply-the sweet, pathetic whistle of
the quail lost in a forest of grass. The mother bird utters a low “all
is well.” One by one, near and far, the note is taken up, and they begin
to return. Bill holds his breath. His finger moves inside the trigger
guard. He only has to squeeze a fraction of an inch. Three more birds
shoot out of the grass. Chuck fires. At first we think Bill has, but he
cannot stoop this low. He does not have the heart. Disgusted, he throws
his gun on the ground. Both barrels go off. Chuck snaps around, startled
and concerned. Bill is shaking like a leaf.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s the matter? What are you so upset
about?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They surprised me again. Chuck sends a
retriever after the fallen birds, then–in an unprecedented gesture-he
puts his arm over Bill’s shoulder to comfort him, like an older
brother.</p>
<p><strong>181 new angle</strong>: They return home, the day’s kill
slung over the back of a Shetland pony.</p>
<p><strong>182 ext. back yard</strong>: They sit on stools in the back
yard plucking the birds.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You like to box?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I never have.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just wondering. I got a pair of gloves I
brought with me. Bill feels oddly better, as though Chuck had backed
down.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Abby bought me this at Yellowstone. Chuck
shows Bill his knife. Bill reads a name off the handle.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s what she calls you? ‘Chickie?’ He gets
up, his nostrils flaring with anger. Chuck thinks this indignance is on
his behalf.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Doesn’t bother me. Should it? Bill throws
down the pheasant he was plucking.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t let her fool you, too. She warms up to
whoever says please and thank you.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s the matter? Bill, still angry at
himself, considers telling him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You really want to know? He would like Chuck
to know the truth but does not want theresponsibility for revealing it.
He must find out by accident. Luckily they are interrupted as Ursula
runs up, pointing over her shoulder. A pair of three-wing airplanes
sputters into view low overhead. One seems to be having engine
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>183 ext. field near belvedere</strong>: The planes set down
in a nearby field. “Toto’s Flying Circus” is emblazoned on the
wings.</p>
<p><strong>184 new angle</strong>: Five PEOPLE clamber out, members of a
seedy vaudeville troupe. They swagger around, filthy with oil from the
backwash of the props, looking more like convicts than entertainers.
Their LEADER is an excitable Levantine.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: How long it take to fix? Very mooch time!
Now look where you hab stuck us. Salaupe! You forget who I aim! Bill,
Abby and Ursula approach the aircraft with the greatest caution, like
the Indians at Cortez’s ships.</p>
<p><strong>185 ext. screen - night</strong>: A JUGGLER and a SNAKE
CHARMER perform first separately, then jointly as a slap act. A DOUBLE
TALKER weaves sentences of absolute nonsense. After a moment a black and
white image appears over his face and he drops out of sight. The troupe
is putting on a show to earn its supper. ONE of them stands behind the
viewers – Abby and Bill, Chuck and Ursula – cranking a carbide projector
by hand. A silent movie appears on the screen, full of extraordinary
pratfalls, disappearances and other tricks of the early cinema. Chuck
has never seen anything remotely like this. CHUCK How’d they do that?
Where’d he go? There must be a wire. Etc. He steps forward to inspect
the screen, actually just a sheet hung along a clothesline, to see
whether the image is coming from behind. Bill and Abby sit rapt as
children, nostalgic for Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>186 ext. dinner table - night</strong>: Ursula serves dinner.
She is excited by the visitors’ city ways. They are bored with her, all
except the youngest, GEORGE, a young pilot in a white scarf.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: We never hear a thing out here. It’s like
being on a boat in the middle of a lake. You see things going on, but
way far away, with no voices.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe time to clear out. George puts his
hand on hers. She snatches it away.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the matter? Aren’t I your type or
something? The Doubletalker pokes his fork into a pudding. A balloon,
concealed beneath the surface, explodes to general delight. Down the
table Abby and Bill chat with the Leader.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: You do not understand, sir. I am saddled
with asses, yaays? I, who once played the Albert Hall</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You. hear that? He called me ‘sir.’ In their
gaiety he carelessly puts a hand on Abby’s leg.</p>
<p><strong>187 tight on chuck - night</strong>: Chuck looks on from the
shadows, no longer just puzzled but angry. He has watched them behave
this way a dozen times before, but tonight, with other people around, he
must see it more directly.</p>
<p><strong>188 ext. straw stack - night</strong>: George tells Ursula a
joke. She dissolves in giggles before he can finish, as though amazed at
his power to dispense illusion.</p>
<p><strong>189 int. living room - night</strong>: Chuck, alone in the
darkened living room, calms himself down by breathing through a rubber
mask into a respirator. Joyful noises reach him from outside.</p>
<p><strong>190 chuck’s pov - next morning</strong>: The next morning
Chuck looks down out his bedroom window. The troupe is packing to leave.
Still troubled, he walks to the bed and and stands over Abby.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s going on, Abby? She does not respond.
He yanks the sheet off. She is wearing a nightgown. She looks up and
frowns. This is the first time she has ever seen him this way.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You know what I mean. Between you and
Bill.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I have no idea…..</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Something’s not right, and I want to know
what. Abby jumps out of bed and assumes the offensive. She has no other
choice.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Say it out loud. What’re you worried about?
Incest?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: It just doesn’t look right. I don’t know how
brothers and sisters carry on where you come from, but…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Did you ever have a brother. Then who are you
to judge? Maybe if you had, you’d understand. Anyway, times have changed
while you’ve been stuck out in this weed patch. We’re line missing She
puts on a robe and walks out. Her last argument has worked best. Chuck
never imagined he was in step with the times.</p>
<p><strong>191 ext. belvedere</strong>: Abby slips out the front door.
She looks around to make sure that Chuck is not watching her, then heads
off to find Bill. The vaudevillians gorge themselves on last night’s
leftovers, steal flowers from the flower beds, etc. ONE sits off by
himself, playing a French horn.</p>
<p><strong>192 ext. dorm</strong>: She finds Bill by the dorm throwing a
switchblade in the ground, a toothbrush in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Look what I traded off those clowns. For a
bushel of corn! She draws him by the arm behind a wall. She is trembling
with fear.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Chuck is suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Chickie you mean? So what?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Really. This is the first time he’s ever been
like this. I’m scared. All this flatters Chuck in a way Bill does not
like.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What for? Why’re you so worried what he
thinks?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He could kill us. I want to live a long time,
okay? I just got started and I like it. Bill shrugs, as though to say he
can handle whatever Chuck can dish out and a little more.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You might take a little responsibility here.
You got us into all this.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did I? Well, it never would’ve come up if you
hadn’t led him on. Led Chickie on!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Is that the best you can do? Knowing you it
probably is. You’ve made a mess of our lives, okay. Don’t pretend it was
my fault. Bill combs his hair to calm himself down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why’s this guy still hanging on like a goddamn
snapping turtle? Because of you. Boy, this was a great idea. Right up
there with Lincoln going down to the theater, see what’s on!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t give me that. When a guy’s getting
screwed, he’s got a right to holler.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re such a fool!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I heard what you said.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Then why’d you ask? Oh, how did I ever get
mixed up with you? Abby, in terror of Chuck’s finding out, cannot
understand why Bill seems to care so little.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’ve gone sweet on him. You have, haven’t
you? Abby hesitates. Bill throws his knife away.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I admire him. He’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Broad shoulders. I know. Very high morals. Why
can’t he talk faster? It’s like waiting for a hen to lay an egg.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You wouldn’t understand, though. He’s not like
you. You don’t know how people feel. You only think of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s going on between us, Abby? Think about
that. If you figure it out, tell me, will you? I’d appreciate it. Lord,
but you do come on! You talking like this, used to play around right
under his nose. Somebody I met in a bar, remember? Or maybe you walked
in, thought it was a church. Well, I’ve had it.I’m clearing out. You
understand? They look at each other for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Go ahead. This is not what he expected to
hear. But now his pride requires that he face the truth and not back
down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Okay. He looks at her for a moment. He cannot
be dealt with this way. He turns and walks off.</p>
<p><strong>193 new angle</strong>: Ursula flirts with George. He slips a
hand inside her blouse. She bats it away.</p>
<p><strong>194 ext. bedroom window</strong>: Bill stands on the ground
below the master bedroom. Chuck leans out the window above him. Peacocks
roost on the balcony, beneath the telescope. The vaudevillians are
loading up their planes. Abby watches from the porch.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m going away for a while. They’re giving me
a lift.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What for? He shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m wearing one of your shirts. Let me take it
off for you.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I got my own. Just wasn’t any clean today.
Bill takes off the shirt, drapes it over a post and walks off, hurt and
angry, but with a sad dignity. Chuck is not entirely sorry to see him
go, nor is Abby; she knows that he is getting out just in time. One more
episode like last night’s and the fuse would hit the powder.</p>
<p><strong>195 new angle</strong>: Bill gives Ursula his money.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We get split up for any reason, you spend that
on school.</p>
<p><strong>196 ext. prairie</strong>: The vaudevillians are ready to
take off. Bill boards the plane which George is piloting, wondering if
today’s break with Abby is real or just in anger, a necessary gesture.
With him he carries his only possessions, a bindle and his trick rabbit.
Abby, Chuck and Ursula look on.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s eating him? Abby shrugs and walks down
to Ursula.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Why aren’t we going with him?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What for? To sleep in boxcars?</p>
<p><strong>197 airplanes</strong>: The planes set their wheels in the
furrows, rev their engines and wobble off into the sky. Ursula waves
goodbye to George.</p>
<p><strong>198 ext. plains under snow - series of angles</strong>:
Winter has come. Snow falls across the breadth of the plains, on the
river and the dark sleeping fields.</p>
<p><strong>199 ext. sleigh - snow</strong>: Chuck and Abby skim over the
snow in a gaily painted sleigh . She is wrapped up snug in a buffalo
robe, her feet on a hot brick. Pigs forage along the fences.</p>
<p><strong>200 int. cave</strong>: They inspect a cave with a kerosene
lantern. Blocks of ice, covered with burlap and sawdust, cool shelves of
preserves. Abby drops a stone into a dark pit. Two seconds pass before
it hits the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Probably that’s the first noise down there for
thousands of years. She speaks as though she had done it a favor. He
puts his hand on hers. She presses it against her chest.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You ever wish you could turn your heart off
for a second and see what happened?</p>
<p><strong>201 other angles</strong>: Views of backlit gems,
stalactites, salamanders in their cold dark pools, hidden springs and
other mysteries of nature. ABBY Maybe nothing would. They round a corner
and come upon an underground waterfall. It flows out of darkness back
into darkness.</p>
<p><strong>202 int. forge</strong>: Bill, meanwhile, stands in a line of
panting, sweating IMMIGRANTS. On their shoulders they carry the huge
barrel of a cannon. With a grunt they drive it into the fiery mouth of a
forge.</p>
<p><strong>203 ext. city street</strong>: Bill stands on the corner of a
big city street, stamping his feet against the cold. He tries to catch a
pigeon with some bread crumbs under a box propped up by a stick, but
just as he pulls the string to drop the trap it darts out of the
way.</p>
<p><strong>204 bill and young girl</strong>: Bill has an improvised
conversation with a YOUNG GIRL who has run away from home. He asks her
where she comes from, whom she belongs to, etc. She tells him of her
hopes, then passes on. Bill gives her all the money in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>205 montage</strong>: Enthralled, Abby surveys the wonders of
Babylon and Nineveh in a book about the Near East. Ursula sits with a
world globe, taking a geography lesson from a traveling TUTOR. No doubt
this was Abby’s idea. Abby copies from a small plaster model of a Roman
bust. She wants painfully to improve herself.</p>
<p><strong>206 ext. frozen lake -night</strong>: Abby and Chuck skate
around a bonfire on a frozen prairie lake, carrying torches to guide
them through the dark.</p>
<p><strong>207 int. chicago flophouse</strong>: Bill sits in a cold
flophouse trying to write a letter. After a moment he wads it up and
throws it away.</p>
<p><strong>208 ext. belvedere</strong>: Abby, Ursula and Chuck are on a
walk outside the Belvedere. The snow is gone. Abby’s hands are stuffed
in a chinchilla muff. All at once they hear a distant noise like the
whoops of an Indian war party. It seems mysteriously to come from every
hilltop. Abby turns to Chuck with a puzzled look.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Prairie chickens. That means winter’s
broken.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Really? Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You hardly ever see them. They stand and
listen to the birds. There is a sense of the earth stirring back to
life. Abby breathes in with a wild joy and hugs Chuck tightly by the
waist.</p>
<p><strong>209 ext. tenement hallway</strong>: Bill is talking with a
FRIEND in the hallway of a tenement.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I can’t seem to get my mind on anything. I
thought, when I came off that place, boy, they’d better get all the
women out of town that day, you know? Somewhere safe. But you know what
I do? I sleep, nothing but sleep. A PANHANDLER approaches them with a
hard-luck story.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: Okay, here’s a quarter, but give me some
entertainment, okay? Not this old song and dance. While the Panhandler
performs, Bill looks around. Two POLICEMEN have appeared in the entryway
talking with the LANDLADY. Bill edges out the back door and down the
steps, as though they might be after him. He walks briskly down the
alley without looking back.</p>
<p><strong>210 tight on chuck</strong>: Chuck holds a handful of seed
under his nose. His heart stirs at the dark, mellow smell. Into this
dissolves an image of Abby writing in her diary.</p>
<p><strong>211 ext. field</strong>: Chuck swings a barometer round and
round, checking the weather. Two Case tractors pitch across a field like
boats on a rolling sea. Long plumes of smoke wind off behind them. Each
tows a fourteen-gang plow. A third tractor follows, putting in the seed.
Ursula chases a flock of blackbirds off with a big rattle. Every acre of
ground for as far as the eye can see is under cultivation. ABBY They put
in the wheat the other day. This will be the biggest year ever. There
was a scare when a locust turned up. Luckily it wasn’t the bad kind.</p>
<p><strong>212 new angle</strong>: The plows have turned up a
hibernating locust. Chuck stands by the tractor, inspecting it under a
magnifying glass. The creature nestles like a fossil in the black earth.
ABBY They sleep in the ground for seventeen years, then crawl up around
the end of May and spend a week flying around before they die. Chuck
kicks up the dirt around the plow, looking for others. Benson, back from
exile, looks concerned.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Nothing to worry about. Just shows the land
is good.</p>
<p><strong>213 series of angles</strong>: Various wonders of the
prairie: a charred tree, a huge mastodon bone, a flowering bush, a
pelican, the rusted hulk of an ancient machine, etc. ABBY How strange
this new world is! You walk out in the morning sometimes to find a lake
rippling where the day before solid land was.</p>
<p><strong>214 ext. stone boat</strong>: Chuck has laid out the outline
of a 50-foot boat in whitewashed stones. He walks around the imaginary
deck showing Abby where the cabins will be. ABBY Chuck wants to build a
boat and take us off to Java, which he’s never seen.</p>
<p><strong>215 ext. fields</strong>: Ursula goes out to the fields with
an organist named JOEY whom Chuck has hired to play for the crops. He
and Ursula seem to hit it off. ABBY Last month he brought in a kid to
play the organ. He claims it helps the crops grow. Personally I doubt
it.</p>
<p><strong>216 ext. middle of fields</strong>: They have brought an
organ out into the middle of the fields. Ursula pumps up the bellows.
Joey sits in front of the keyboard and shoots his cuffs. His fingers
strike the keys.</p>
<p><strong>217 clouds, closeups of plants - time lapse
photography</strong>: Clouds build in huge toadstools. Thunder rolls
across the plains. A rain begins to fall. The music seems to work a
magic on the crops, to draw them forth. The seeds germinate in the
darkness of the soil. Water finds its way down. Roots, tiny hairs at
first, spread and grow.</p>
<p><strong>218 dolls, tight angles on their faces</strong>: Rude dolls
fixed at the ends of pointed sticks–agricultural fetishes that Chuck’s
father brought with him from the Old World–stand around the field to
join in aiding the crops.</p>
<p><strong>219 ext. belvedere</strong>: Flags and bunting adorn the
porch for Independence Day. Ursula sets off some fireworks. ABBY Time
has flown, and once again harvest is near.</p>
<p><strong>220 ext. green fields</strong>: The bald earth has, as though
by a mystery, become a sheet of grain, its green already fading to gold.
The music dies away, replaced by the whirr of summer crickets. ABBY It
will be a year that we have been here. The camera holds and holds on the
fields until in their vacant depths, we begin to sense the presence of a
deep malevolence, still biding its time but growing every minute.
Seagulls–like strange emissaries from another world–glide back and forth
over the fields in search of grasshoppers.</p>
<p><strong>221 int. lantern - night</strong>: Ursula takes curling irons
from the chimney of a lantern where she has set them to heat, and
applies them to Abby hair.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Suppose I never fall in love, Abby?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Don’t be silly. Everybody does. What do you
think all those songs are about? You need to be careful, though, and not
throw it away.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Throw what away?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You know, your chances. It’s too hard to
explain to a little squirrel like you.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: That sounded just like Bill. Don’t you miss
him?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Sometimes. From her tone, however, we sense
that she finds it easier with him gone.</p>
<p><strong>222 int. master bedroom</strong>: Abby whispers something to
Chuck in bed that evening.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You ever said that to anybody else? She
giggles.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re lying, aren’t you? Well, go right on
lying. The camera moves to the window, beneath the eave. Outside,
peacocks strut back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>223 ext. muddy road</strong>: Bill rides an Indian motorcycle
along a muddy road back to the bonanza. His rabbit is strapped to the
back. He stops for a moment to look at the new fields.</p>
<p><strong>224 ext. belvedere - bill’s pov</strong>: Abby sings to
herself as she beats out a carpet. Bill appears on the ridge behind her.
Hope leaves him like a ghost. She looks happily settled into a new life
with Chuck. All at once she turns around.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Bill! She rushes up and embraces him, but her
warmth just seems a tease to Bill. She is different. She looks
different. The tutors and tailors Chuck has brought in over the winter
have given her more polish. Her hair is nicely coiffed. Where she used
to dress in cotton shirtwaists, she wears crinolines now.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How’s everybody been?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Including me? Okay. Gee, you look good.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thanks. And Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Still the same.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Actually I didn’t mean it that way. I came
back to help out with the harvest. He feels humiliated at not having a
stronger excuse. But he loves her. He aches with love. He hoped their
last fight was just another storm in the romance. Evidently it was
more.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I thought about you a lot. Wrote you a letter,
but it was no good, so I tore it up.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How’d you come?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Train. He looks her up and down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nice dress.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m glad you like it. He admires her garden.
His familiar cockiness vanishes as little by little he sees the old
feeling is not there.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This is new, too.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: The daffodils were already here, but I put in
the rest. You really do like them? At a shriek from Ursula, Bill turns
around. She runs into his arms, and covers him with kisses.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: I’ve missed you! I thought about you every
day. You should’ve written. Did Abby show you what she got? Abby scowls
at Ursula. With no choice but to show him, she opens the top button of
her blouse and draws out a diamond necklace.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: For Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Plus a music box. He spoils her. Why don’t
they spoil me, too? You oughta be glad you didn’t have to spend the
winter. You would’ve gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>225 tight on abby</strong>: The winter’s peace is gone. Abby
is sick with fear. Now that she loves Chuck, too, she can never again be
honest with Bill. The truth of her feelings would crush him. Moreover,
there’s no telling how he might react. He could ruin everything, even
get them killed.</p>
<p><strong>226 ext. bedroom window</strong>: Chuck looks on from behind
the bedroom window.</p>
<p><strong>227 ext. dinner table</strong>: They dine in awkward silence.
Benson has joined them. Abby, for all her winter’s polish, still eats
with the back of her knife.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: How was Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How’s everybody doing?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Okay. They are silent for a moment. Bill
senses that nobody except Ursula is really glad to see him back.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How’s Blackie?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Still hasn’t wised up. Know what I mean? He
asked how you were doing, though. I told him. Ran into Sam, too. He’d
been in a fight.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Oh yeah? Bill can see that her interest is
only polite. He knows that he should turn around and leave, but he
cannot. The sight of him with his confidence gone is painful to
behold.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: His nose was like this. He pushes his nose to
one side. Ursula and Abby laugh.</p>
<p><strong>228 ext. stock pond</strong>: Bill plants willow slips in the
soft earth by the stock pond. Ursula orders a dog around.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Look at this dog mind me. Sit! You’ve got to
say it like hitting a nail.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Has she asked you anything about me?</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: No. Ursula flirts with him, running the
shoots along his back. She waits to see what he will do. He gets up and
after a short chase catches her. He holds her at arm’s length for a
moment, then kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: What’d you do that for? Bill wonders
himself. To get revenge on Abby? He touches her breast.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Cause there’s nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I can be the judge of that.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Then ask first. He kisses her neck.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nobody has to know but us chickens. What do I
have to say to convince you? You tell me, I’ll say it.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: What makes you think I would?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nothing. She giggles and kisses him back. But
guilt has caught up with him. He cannot go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: What’s the matter? No reply.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Maybe it would be wrong. You still love her,
don’t you? Bill hums a rock off toward the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I should’ve gone in the church, like my father
was after me to.</p>
<p><strong>229 bill’s pov - outside the belvedere - night</strong>:
Chuck and Abby sit in their cozy living room playing Parcheesi. The
sound of their voices is muffled. The camera draws back to reveal Bill
outside the window, watching. She is comfortable with Chuck now.
Apparently, he has lost his place in her heart. He wants to rush in and
drag her away.</p>
<p><strong>230 ext. bedroom window - night</strong>: Later that night he
stands under the bedroom window and wonders at the meaning of the
shadows that flicker across the ceiling. After a moment he withdraws
into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>231 ext. small prairie town</strong>: Bill has brought Abby
into a nearby town to make some purchases. Dressed in a chauffeur’s gown
and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her
move from store to store. Ursula is with her. The TOWNSPEOPLE all speak
German. Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress. The
signs are old German script. Two MEN carry a huge bulb through the
street, to put atop a church.</p>
<p><strong>232 overland auto</strong>: Abby walks up with Ursula.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Listen, I’m going to stay and go back with
the laundry wagon. Abby looks at Bill, then nods okay. Ursula runs off.
Bill opens the door, and she gets in.</p>
<p><strong>233 ext. road outside town</strong>: They are stopped on the
road a hundred yards outside the town. Abby smokes as Bill checks the
radiator. Something in his behavior leads us to suspect he may have
staged this stop.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Me? Fine.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We don’t talk so much these days.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I know. She knows what he wants. She cannot
give it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I said a lot of stupid things before I went
off.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I forgot about it already. Bill, trying his
best to make peace with her, cannot help seeing that she would like to
keep things as they are–and not because she harbors any grudge.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’ve forgiven me?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: There was nothing to forgive. He holds a
bottle of liquor out to her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’re you worried about? She takes a swig.
He laughs. She laughs back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So how’m I doing with you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Fine. He takes her hand and holds it like a
trapped bird.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s happened? She shrugs, disengaging her
hand to brush aside her hair. She is painfully aware of his suffering
but doesn’t have the heart to tell him how it all is.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I probably ought to leave. I will.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Already? You just got here. She hasn’t really
contradicted him. He leans forward as though to kiss her. She lets him.
She wishes that she could give herself to him, but she doesn’t know what
is right. Then, a sudden impulse of panic, she gets up and backs
away.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where you going? He reaches out to catch her.
She breaks away and starts to run. He walks quickly after her, cutting
off any escape toward the town.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why’d you have to come back?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you. I only want to talk
with you. She stops and hides her face in her hands. He gently pulls
them away.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I didn’t come back to make trouble for you. I
guess we were fooling each other to think it could last. I mean, What
was I offering youanyhow? A ride to the bottom. Looking at you now, in
the right clothes and everything, I see how crazy I was and–well, I
understand. It’s okay. I sort of cut my own throat, actually. Her eyes
close and her legs give in. Bill lets her go and backs off a step in
surprise. She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance.</p>
<p><strong>234 tight on bill</strong>: Bill, taken by surprise, goes up
and kneels down beside her. He looks to see that she is okay. He picks a
fox-tail out of her hair. Her dress has worked up toward her knees. He
pulls it back down. He wants to caress her face but hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How’d we let it happen, Abby? We were so happy
once. Why didn’t we starve? I love you so much. What have1 done? You’re
so beautiful. What have I done? He touches his lips for a fraction of a
second to hers, notices another car approaching down the road. He picks
her up like a doll and carries her back to the Overland.</p>
<p><strong>235 ext. belvedere - chuck’s pov</strong>: They have arrived
back at the Belvedere.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m sorry. She touches his face in a surge of
sympathy. What has she done to him? He kisses her neck and leads her
toward the front door.</p>
<p><strong>236 crane to chuck</strong>: The camera rises to the
uppermost story of the Belvedere. Chuck has seen them. Hot tears leap to
his eyes. Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such
intimacies between them. Now it all looks different.</p>
<p><strong>237 chuck’s povs</strong>: He looks around at his estate–his
barn, his auto, his great house and his granary. None of them is any
consolation now. Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in
some time long past.</p>
<p><strong>238 int. bedroom</strong>: Abby notices Chuck watching her
outside the bedroom door.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You want something from me?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Will you hand me that magazine? He gives her
the magazine she wants.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’s the matter? He seems for a moment to
consider telling her, then shrugs and goes downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>239 int. living room</strong>: He stumbles into a bird cage
but hardly notices. The jostled birds raise a fuss.</p>
<p><strong>240 ext. front porch</strong>: He runs into Bill on the front
porch.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ve been looking for you. I have to take off
again, real soon here, and… Chuck puts a hand on Bill’s shoulder,
stopping him. They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on.
Bill seems puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>241 ext. fields</strong>: Chuck walks out into the deep of
his fields. The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in. He
sits down and rests his head against a furrow, powerless to think. The
wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads. He puts his
hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a
wounded animal. He could not himself quite say what it is that he
knows.</p>
<p><strong>242 ext. bonanza - series of angles</strong>: Late that
afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the
bonanza. We do not see where they come from. They seem to appear out of
nowhere, unnoticed. Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn. Chuck
lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed.</p>
<p><strong>243 animals on bonanza</strong>: The animals sense it first.
The buffalo move off in a mass. The horses become uncontrollable. One
runs around the barn in a panic. Bill watches it, puzzled. Two peacocks
have a fight. A dog in the treadmill races in vain to escape, driving
the machine to a feverish pitch. The shadow of a giant cloud licks over
the hills.</p>
<p><strong>244 ext. fields</strong>: Everything seems normal in the
fields. Then, as you listen, a strange new sound begins to rise from
them, a wild sea-like singing. As the camera moves over the fields and
down into the wheat it swells in a crescendo until…</p>
<p><strong>245 tight on locusts</strong>: Suddenly we see them up close,
devouring the stalks in a fever, the noise of their jaws magnified a
thousand times. They slip into the Belvedere, under the sash and
wainscoting, turning up first in places it would seem they could never
get into: a jewelry case, the back of a radio, the works of a music box,
a bottle with a miniature ship inside, etc.</p>
<p><strong>246 extreme closeups</strong>: Their eyes are dumb and
implacable. They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own.</p>
<p><strong>247 int. kitchen</strong>: Little by little they gather in
numbers. Ursula first sees one on the drainboard. She swats it with a
newspaper. Others sprout up. One by one she picks them up with a tongs
and drops them into the stove. This method is too slow. She begins to
use her fingers. She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she
understands this is futile. At last claustro-phobia seizes her. She
spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight.</p>
<p><strong>248 int. master bedroom</strong>: In the bedroom overhead,
Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another. She jumps out of bed and
goes to the window. The locusts pelt against the pane like shot. She
throws the bolt. Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass. She jumps
back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in. They are
free to enter.</p>
<p><strong>249 series of angles</strong>: Suddenly they are everywhere:
on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of
clothing. Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration.</p>
<p><strong>250 tight on chuck - slow motion</strong>: Chuck, asleep in
the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion. His hair is seething
with them.</p>
<p><strong>251 ext. bonanza - further angles</strong>: Panic hits the
bonanza. Workers tie string around their pant cuffs to keep the insects
from crawling up their legs, then rush out to the fields with gongs,
rattles, pot lids, scarecrows on sticks, drums and horns and other
noisemakers to scare them off. Some pray. Others run around like madmen,
stamping and yelling, ignored by the gathering host. A couple get into a
fistfight. A storm flag is run up the flagpole. A tractor blasts out an
S.O.S. The peacocks huddle under the stoop.</p>
<p><strong>252 tight on chuck</strong>: Chuck gives Benson his
orders.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Offer fifty cents a bushel for them. Get out
the reapers. See what you can harvest.</p>
<p><strong>253 high down angle</strong>: The locusts snap through the
air. Bill, swatting at them with a shovel, stops to gag. One has flown
into his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>254 tight on gears</strong>: They jam up the gears of the
machinery with the crush of their bodies.</p>
<p><strong>255 int. master bedroom</strong>: Abby throws a sheet over
herself, but they get in under it. She thrashes around madly, then with
a cry goes limp.</p>
<p><strong>256 chuck and benson</strong>: Benson reports back to Chuck.
A team of horses races by, nearly bowling them over.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: We can’t get the machines out. They’re
jamming up the gears. There’s a good chance they’ll pass on south,
though. Unless… unless a wind comes up.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What happens then?</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: They’ll set down and walk in.</p>
<p><strong>257 signs of damage</strong>: The locusts devour not just the
crops but every organic thing: pitchfork handles, linens on the
clothesline, leather traces, flowers in the window boxes, etc. Soon a
large area of wheat is eaten down to stubble. Bill looks away from a
tree for a second. When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry
bareness.</p>
<p><strong>258 ext. wind generator, other angles</strong>: The vanes of
the wind generator begin gently to stir. Little by little the wind picks
up. A dust devil spins across the yard. The grass lists by the well. A
power line moans.</p>
<p><strong>259 ext. fields</strong>: As the sun dips below the horizon,
the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a
procession of Army ants. The roar of their wings is deafening. The air
hisses and pops with their electric frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>260 stock and matte shots - sunset</strong>: And these are
but the advance elements of a main force which looms like a silver cloud
on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>261 ext. bonfire - night</strong>: WORKERS dump bushels of
the insects into a bonfire. A MAN with an abacus keeps track of what
each is owed.</p>
<p><strong>262 same fields - night</strong>: The wind has picked up.
Chuck, Bill and Abby have come out to the fields with a dozen WORKERS to
investigate the extent of the damage. The insects buzz around blindly in
the light of their lanterns, which they carry Japanese-fashion at the
ends of cane poles.</p>
<p><strong>263 tight on chuck - night</strong>: Chuck inspects the
grain.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: There’s nothing we can do but wait. They’re
either going to take it all or they’re not. He covers his face with his
hands. The others shy back at this display of grief, startling in one so
formal. Their jostled lanterns cast a dance of lights. Bill, moved to
real sympathy, takes him by the shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on. They might still lift. Hey, I’ve seen
a wind like this lay down and die. Don’t give up now.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: We could at least make sure they don’t get
the people on south. He breaks open the mantle of his lantern, still
unsure what he should do. Some of the flaming kerosene splashes onto the
crops nearby, setting them ablaze. Bill drops his rattle and swats the
fire out with his coat.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’re you doing? Watch it! What’re you,
crazy? There’s still a chance, don’t you see? Chuck goes to his horse.
Bill grabs him by the sleeve. Does he really mean to set the fields on
fire? Chuck pushes him aside. Bill, frantic, turns to the others for
support.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Stop him, or it’s all going up. They, however,
are too uncertain of their ground to intervene. Chuck turns on Bill.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What does it matter to you? Chuck slings fire
out of the broken lantern onto the crops next to Bill – a sudden,
hostile gesture that catches them all by surprise. Independent of his
will, the truth is forcing its way up, like a great blind fish from the
bottom of the sea. He slings the fire out again. A patch lands on Bill’s
pantleg. Bill slaps it out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s got into you? They stare at each other.
Bill backs off like a cat, sensing Chuck knows the truth, but at a loss
to understand how he could.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Why do you care? I gave my life for this
land. Chuck walks towards him. Suddenly Bill turns and takes off
running. Chuck swings at him with the lantern. Bill escapes behind the
building wall of flame that springs up between them. The whirr of the
locusts stops for a moment–they seem at times to have a collective
mind–then, just as mysteriously, resumes.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Stop, Chuck! Chuck leaps on his horse. She
tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot.
Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his
stirrup. He eludes them and rides off after Bill, leaving a slash of
flame behind him in the grain. They tear off their coats to swat it out,
in vain–already it stretches a hundred yards.</p>
<p><strong>264 bill</strong>: Bill runs through the night, still
carrying his lantern. Chuck bears down on him. Abby chases along behind
him, screaming for him to stop. Bill realizes the lantern is giving his
position away He blows it out and vanishes from sight. All we can see is
the thundering horseman, sowing fire.</p>
<p><strong>265 crane shot</strong>: With a rough idea where Bill is,
Chuck begins to lay a ring of fire around him, fifty yards in
diameter.</p>
<p><strong>266 bill and abby inside ring</strong>: Abby spots Bill
against the flames. She rushes up, gasping. They have been caught inside
the ring.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’re you doing? This is a bad place to talk
He throws his coat over Abby’s head, picks her up by the waist and
crashes through the flame. They have to shout to make themselves
understood. The locusts roar like a cyclone.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did you see that? He was trying to burn me.
What’s got into him?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He knows. He must.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: A whole year’s work. All wasted! These bugs,
once they make up their minds… Bill stalls. The fire races toward them
through the wheat. They appear as silhouettes against it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I need to get out of here. I think you
probably should, too. Hell of a life. Damned if you do and damned if you
don’t. He leaves. Abby wonders if she ought to run after him.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Bill! But this moment’s hesitation has been
too long. Already he is swallowed up in the night, her voice swept away
in the roar of the flame and the locusts, who seem to wail louder now,
and with a great mournfulness–like keening Arab women–as if they knew
the fate shortly to envelop them. Abby turns back. She, too, has reason
to fear Chuck and must escape.</p>
<p><strong>267 new angle</strong>: Benson rallies the workers.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: There’s still a chance they’re going to
fly.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Get the tractor out! The pump wagon!
Blankets! They rush off to find equipment to fight the fire.</p>
<p><strong>268 isolated on chuck - night</strong>: Chuck rides through
the dark like a lone Horseman of the Apocalypse, setting his fields on
fire.</p>
<p><strong>269 ext. plains on fire - series of angles - night</strong>:
Tractors attempt to plow a firebreak. Mad silhouettes run back and
forth, slapping at the blaze with wet gunny sacks fixed to the ends of
sticks. Two dormitories burn out of control. Ursula throws open the barn
and lets the horses out. They have raised thunder kicking at their
stalls. The light above the barn door pulses erratically.</p>
<p><strong>270 explosions - night</strong>: Oil wells explode along the
horizon. Huge balls of flames roll into the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>271 ext. burning plains - night</strong>: Panic spreads among
the workers as the holocaust threatens to engulf them. They throw down
their tools and run for their lives.</p>
<p><strong>272 animals - night</strong>: Animals flee in all directions:
birds and deer and rabbits, pigs, buffalo and the horses from the barn.
The locusts mill around crazily on the wheat stalks, backlit against the
flame.</p>
<p><strong>273 bill - night</strong>: Bill, fleeing on his motorbike
with his rabbit, holds up for a moment to watch the fire–a Biblical
inferno of spectacular sweep.</p>
<p><strong>274 ext. bedroom window–tracking shot –night</strong>: A
single light burns in the Belvedere.</p>
<p><strong>275 int. bedroom - night</strong>: Heaving with sobs, Abby
throws her things into a bindle. She has lost Chuck forever. Their life
is destroyed. She glances out the window. She still has time to get
away, but she must hurry. She bolts for the door. Sud- denly Chuck steps
from the shadows, blocking her exit. His face, black with soot, looks
gruesome in the gas1ight. The locusts have chewed up his clothes. Abby
is like a frightened deer. Did he see her packing?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You look as though you’d seen a ghost. Where
you going? Off with him? The wind cuts gaps in the death wail of the
locusts. From time to time we hear the thump of an exploding well.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: He’s not your brother, is he? How much does
he know? She edges toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Come here a minute. Who are you? Where’d you
come from?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I told you. He shakes her. She quivers like a
child in his grasp. She no longer has the audacity to lie.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How long have you known? He drops his eyes.
Shamefully long – and his anger is partly just at this.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’d you want? He punches in the shade of a
lamp, extinguishing it.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Tell me. He shoves over the chest of drawers.
She does not move. He tears down the drapes, already in shreds.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: This? Show me what you wanted! I would have
given it all to you.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Please, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Please what? You’re not going to tell me
you’re sorry, I hope..</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: But I am. Outside the window fires rage along
half the horizon. He sits down. He wants to sob, but cannot.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re so wonderful. How could you do
this?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m just no good. You picked me from the
gutter, and this is how – I never deserved you.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: The things you told me.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I love you, though. You have to believe me. It
may sound false after…</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Down at the cave. Don’t you remember? I
believed them.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: All right. I’m going away. You’ll never have
to see me again.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Away? He gets up, suddenly alarmed, walks to
the mantel and opens a chest.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’re you doing? Chuck drapes his neck with
the stole he used in slaughtering the hog. Her face goes empty. He gets
his razor strop from the shaving basin. She shrinks back in the corner.
He looks at her for a moment, then leaves the room.</p>
<p><strong>276 int. staircase - night</strong>: Abby pursues him down
the stairs. He throws her aside.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Where are you doing? Chuck! What are you
doing? I won’t let you! Come back! Again he throws her aside, and again
she keeps after him, desperate to prevent any harm coming to Bill.
Finally he picks her up and drags her outside.</p>
<p><strong>277 ext. porch - night</strong>: He lashes her with a rope to
a column of the porch. She struggles vainly to free herself. Does he
intend to use the razor on her?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No, Chuck! Please, darling! It wasn’t his
fault. It was mine. Let him go. I love you, Chuck. Do anything, only
please…</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I’m sick of hearing lies. He stuffs a
handkerchief in her mouth and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>278 tight on chuck - night</strong>: Chuck wanders through
the night with a lantern, calling his mare.</p>
<p><strong>279 ext. burnt-out fields - dawn</strong>: Dawn breaks. Chuck
rides over the burnt-out fields looking for Bill. The feet of his lank
white mare are wrapped to the fetlock in wet burlap, to protect them
from the smouldering grass. It prances warily along, without making a
sound, wreathed in a mist of blue smoke. With him he carries a stool.
The camera pans up to the smoke which is carrying his fortune off.</p>
<p><strong>280 chuck’s povs</strong>: Burnt, blind deer stand and look
at him in utter terror, as though they understood his intentions. The
roasted corpses of sharptail grouse, coyotes and badgers lie scattered
here and there. Piles of dung burn on after the grass is out. A peacock
from the Belvedere wanders around, angry and perplexed.</p>
<p><strong>281 bill</strong>: Bill is repairing his motorbike by a rock
in the middle of the scorched landscape. The tires are soft as licorice
from the heat. Suddenly, he looks up. Chuck has found him. He jumps
behind the handlebars and fishtails off. Chuck breaks into a gallop,
rides him down, knocks him to the ground with the stool, dismounts and
stamps in the spokes of the front wheel to make sure he goes no
further.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who do you think you are? Now you’ve ruined
it. What’s got into you?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why do I have to tell you? I can come and go
when I like. This is still a free country, last I heard. Bill stops when
he sees the stool. Chuck calmly strops the razor on his stirrup flap.
There are no secrets now.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What can I say? Too late for apologies. You’ve
got a right to hate me. Chuck puts the razor away and advances on Bill
with the stool.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I want to leave. You won’t ever see me again.
I already got what I deserve. There is nothing Bill can say to appease
him. This will be a fight to the death. Chuck lashes out with the stool.
Bill ducks too late.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Watch it! Chuck comes at him again. Bill
throws a punch, but Chuck blocks it and knocks him down again with the
stool. Bill reels back and cracks his head on the bicycle frame. This
time he stays down. Satisfied the struggle is over, Chuck goes back to
get some rope.</p>
<p><strong>282 new angle</strong>: Chuck shuts his eyes to mumble a
prayer of absolution–in Russian. Bill in a panic, snaps a spoke out of
the broken wheel and lays it against his sleeve. Chuck moves in for the
kill. Bill gets to his feet. He wants to run but fear makes his knees
like water. Suddenly, they are face to face. Chuck swings at Bill with
the stool but misses. Bill lifts the spoke above him and drives it deep
into Chuck’s heart. Chuck gasps. Bill seems just as shocked. Chuck sits
down to determine the gravity of his injury. Blood jets rhythmically out
the end of the spoke, as though from a straw. Bill circles him,
unbelieving.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Should I pull it out? Chuck puts his finger
over the end of the spoke. Blood seeps out the side of his mouth, like
sap from a broken stem.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I better get somebody. He tries to catch the
reins of Chuck’s horse, but it shies out of reach, its conscience
repelled. He looks back at Chuck in anguish. What has he done?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You were my friend.</p>
<p><strong>283 tight on bill and his povs</strong>: The Belvedere is
visible on the horizon. Bill hesitates a moment, then heads back on foot
to find Abby. He gives Chuck a wide berth. Then, on a ridge in the
distance, he spots Benson.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Get a doctor! Fast! How much did he see? Bill
does not stay to find out but takes off running, though not without
first collecting his rabbit. Benson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to
Chuck’s side. His left sleeve has been burned away. The flesh beneath is
the color of a raw steak.</p>
<p><strong>284 chuck’s povs</strong>: Chuck sees the smoke from his
fields, the burnt deer, a circling hawk.</p>
<p><strong>285 tight on chuck</strong>: He breathes in gulps. His eyes
are blank, like a child’s marbles. He takes Benson’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Wasn’t his fault. Tell her…forgive them. The
locusts can be heard no more. The prairie makes a sound like the ocean.
Chuck turns his back and dies.</p>
<p><strong>286 tight on benson</strong>: Benson weeps. Whether or not he
understood Chuck’s last wishes, he seems unlikely to abide by them.</p>
<p><strong>287 ext. belvedere</strong>: Bill finds Abby bound to the
house like the figurehead of a ship. He cuts her loose. The ropes fall
at her feet. She is free. They look at each other for a moment. Then, in
a rush of compassion for them all, she throws her arms around him. Bill
wonders if she is taking him back. Might their differences all have been
a terrible misunderstanding?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: We have to hurry. Chuck’s out looking right
now. Oh, Bill, what have we done? He took his razor. We need to hurry.
He might be coming back any minute. Bill mentions nothing of his
encounter. She grabs her bindle, Bill a handful of silverware and an
umbrella. After a moment’s hesitation, he puts them back.</p>
<p><strong>288 new angle</strong>: They run down to the barn, where the
cars are stored. The saplings in the front yard have been stripped even
of their bark. Abby stops to look back at the Belvedere one last time.
Chuck does not want her anymore. How could she expect him to? Bill grabs
her by the hand and tugs her along.</p>
<p><strong>289 ext. barn</strong>: Abby throws open the doors of the
barn. Bill cranks up the engine of the Overland.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Will the cops be looking for us, too?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Probably. Abby stands in the door. She is
reluctant to leave, though she knows they must.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Get in. She notices that Bill’s lip is cut,
his shirt soaked with blood.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What happened to you? Where’s this from? Bill
looks down. He forgot.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Had an accident. She looks at him for a
moment, not quite trusting this explanation. The engine catches with a
noise like start- led poultry. Bill gets behind the wheel. Just as they
are pulling out of the garage, Ursula runs up, black as coal from
battling the fire all night.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We got in a jam. You’ll be safer here. Say
we’re headed for town. Take care of the rabbit, too. He’s yours now.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just do what I say. Why’re you always arguing
about everything? Wait here till we get in touch. Bill gives Ursula his
wallet and a kiss. Abby gives her a hug.</p>
<p><strong>290 ext. burnt grass</strong>: They roar off through the
burnt grass of the prairie. Abby waves goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>291 their pov</strong>: As they crest a ridge, Benson appears
in front of them, waving a hand to flag them down. Bill puts his foot on
the gas. Benson sees they are not going to stop and fires at then with a
pistol. Bill grabs a shotgun from a scab- bard under the dash and fires
back. Nobody is hurt.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’s the matter with him? Bill shrugs.
Inside he feels a great relief. They are free at last. At last he has
her back.</p>
<p><strong>292 ext. bonanza gates</strong>: They veer off across the
prairie, towards the Razumihin gates. The music comes up full.</p>
<p><strong>293 ext. shack on river</strong>: They have come to a lone
shack on the river, a drinking house for passing boatmen. They negotiate
with the PROPRIETOR for a tiny steam boat moored at the end of the pier.
When the car is not enough, Abby throws in her necklace.</p>
<p><strong>294 aboard the boat</strong>: They board the boat and turn
down stream. There is a phonograph on board.</p>
<p><strong>295 tight on necklace</strong>: The necklace sparkles on the
hood of the car–a hint they are leaving behind evidence that could
betray them.</p>
<p><strong>296 ext. boat on river - and moving povs</strong>: They glide
along in the hush of evening. The reeds are full of deer. Cranes,
imprudently tame, dance on the sand bars. Bill looks around in wonder.
He knows these may be his last days on earth. Abby throws a sounding
line. A COUPLE from a local farm seeks privacy in the willows. Other
BOATMEN glide past in silence. A CHILD plays a fiddle on the deck of a
scow. HUNTERS creep along the shore in search of waterfowl.</p>
<p><strong>297 ext. camp - dusk</strong>: Bill sleeps under a tarp. Abby
looks out across the water and bursts into sobs. She has wronged Chuck
and thrown her life away.</p>
<p><strong>298 their povs - night</strong>: They shine a lamp into the
murky depths and spear pickerel with a hammered-out fork. Strange rocks
loom up and give way to wide moonlit fields. They have the sense of
entering places where nobody has been since the making of the world.</p>
<p><strong>299 ext. farmhouse</strong>: Four LAWMEN, in pursuit,
interrogate some FARMERS. Have they seen the two people standing by
Chuck in his wedding portrait? Benson holds the bulky frame. There is a
funereal border of black crepe at the corners.</p>
<p><strong>300 ext. aboard the boat - dusk</strong>: They drift idly on
the flood. The phonograph is playing in the stern. Abby is back in
trousers. Bill points to a white house on the shore, an image of comfort
and peace.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I used to want a set-up like that. Something
like that, I thought, and you’d really have it made. Now I don’t care. I
just wish we could always live this way. He sees that her mind is
somewhere else. He wants to tell her the truth about Chuck, for
intimacy’s sake, but it would just put more of a cloud over everything.
It might even cause her to hate him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe you want to write him a letter.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I hadn’t thought of that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You really do love him, don’t you? She does
not reply.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You want to go back?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Too late for that. I could never face him
again. They look at each other for a moment. He touches her face, to
show that he does not hold it against her. She touches him back. They
only have each other now. They must save what moments they can.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Guess it’s you and me again.</p>
<p><strong>301 new angle</strong>: On a sudden whim, Abby takes off her
wedding bracelet and holds it over the water.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Watch this. Bill is caught off guard. Before
he can make a move she throws it far out into the river. They laugh,
without knowing why, at this extravagance.</p>
<p><strong>302 ext. shore .. tracking shots</strong>: They gather May
apples and black haws. The music from the phonograph comes up full. They
dig clams from a sand bar in a playful way. We are reminded of their
first days on the harvest.</p>
<p><strong>303 xt. undergrowth</strong>: They make love in the
undergrowth. Abby, afterwards, lies in a naked daze. The damp greens of
the wilderness envelop her.</p>
<p><strong>304 their pov - on city on river - night</strong>: Rounding a
bend in the river that night, they come upon the lights of a great city.
They have doused the running lamp. Except for a faint groaning of the
trees along the shore, the river is silent, conveying the sounds of the
city to them from across a great distance – bells, joy- ful voices,
horns, the chirping of brakes, etc.</p>
<p><strong>305 ext. city streets and their povs - night</strong>: They
sneak down an alley. There are signs of life behind a few windows, but
the city pursues its gaiety elsewhere. Suddenly, they come upon a
POLICEMAN making his rounds. They let him pass, then cut through a
vacant lot back to the boat.</p>
<p><strong>306 ext. river front - day</strong>: The next morning finds
them camped in a thicket on the river front below a factory. Bill wakes
up, mysteriously happy. Their blankets are heavy with dew. Overhead,
finches tilt from branch to branch. A light wind rushes through the
leaves. Whatever his trou- bles, they seem very small to him in the
great. scheme of things. He looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her
sleep. He puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat. The slope
is strewn with sodden cartons, burnt bricks and burst mattresses, an
avalanche of urban excreta.</p>
<p><strong>307 his pov</strong>: Abruptly he stops. Two POLICE OFFICERS
are combing over the boat. They have not seen him. He edges back.
Suddenly, there is yelling on the hill above them. Bill looks up. Benson
is calling him to the attention of a car-load of POLICEMEN pulling up
beside him. The Officers at the boat now spot him, too, and open fire.
Bill darts like a rabbit into the thicket.</p>
<p><strong>308 tight on abby</strong>: Abby bolts awake. Bill jumps down
beside her, breathless, and begins looking frantically for the shells to
his shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Keep down. Can’t explain now. They’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Who? What’re you talking about? Stop a minute.
He covers her with his body as bullets zoom through the undergrowth. His
face is close to hers. She bursts into tears.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t get shot. Look for me under that next
bridge down. After dark. He empties out the contents of his pockets – a
watch, a couple of dollars in change, a ring – and slaps them down in
front of her. The Police fan out along the ridge above them. He jams a
flare pistol into his belt and kisses her goodbye–after a moment’s
hesitation – on the cheek. She tries in vain to hold him back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I wish I could tell you how much I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>309 ext. mud flat</strong>: Bill runs from the thicket down
to the water. The Police have bunched on the other side. It seems he
might be able to escape. Keeping low, he splashes across a mud flat.
Suddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has left out
overnight. The hooks bite into his thigh and shoulder, yanking a string
of startled, thrashing catfish out of the water. He keeps running in a
panic, not realizing the line is staked to the shore. All at once, he
jackknifes in the air. The stake twangs loose. The Police now spot him
and begin firing.</p>
<p><strong>310 tight on abby</strong>: Abby runs out of hiding, thinking
at first that the Police must be looking for her.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why’re you shooting? You’ll kill him! Have you
gone crazy? Stop! Oh, Bill, not you! Not you!</p>
<p><strong>311 new angle</strong>: Bill stumbles along, trying to rip
the hooks from his flesh, but the fish–fighting their way back to the
water–only drive them in deeper. Ahead two MOUNTED POLICE surge into the
river, blocking his retreat. He empties his shotgun at them and throws
it away. They hold up, astonished. He dashes across a sand bar for the
deep of the river and comparative safety. Black mud clings to his feet,
drawing him down like a fly in molasses. Benson goes running out into
the river ahead of the Police.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Leave him alone. I want him. Leave him
alone. There you go! There you go! He shoots Bill down. Bill turns and
looks at him in sur- prise. Benson shoots him again, point blank.</p>
<p><strong>312 underwater shot</strong>: Bill’s blood fades off quickly
in the gliding water of the river. The line of frightened catfish dances
out behind him like a garland.</p>
<p><strong>313 other angles</strong>: A dog trots off in alarm. Benson
wades into shore, tears streaming down his face, his chest heaving with
emotion. Abby falls to the ground in a convulsion of grief. A short way
down the river PEOPLE come and go along the bridge where they were to
meet.</p>
<p><strong>314 isolated on roller piano</strong>: A roller piano sits in
a corner by itself, playing a fox- trot. The camera moves back.</p>
<p><strong>315 int. arboretum - attic</strong>: YOUNG DANCERS are
learning the foxtrot in the attic of the Arboretum, a tacky Western
version of an Eastern finishing school. The steps are painted on the
floor as white footprints. Abby is apparently enrolling Ursula here. The
headmistress, MADAME MURPHY, boasts of the school’s achievements. Ursula
looks trapped. Abby checks her watch. She must go.</p>
<p><strong>316 ext. brick street</strong>: Abby and Ursula walk down an
empty street. Abby wears a mourning band on her sleeve. She is under the
false im- pression that Ursula likes her new home. An INDIAN PORTER
carts her bags along behind them in a wheelbarrow.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: They’ll teach you poise, too, so you can walk
in any room you please. Pretty soon you’ll know all kind of things. I
never read a whole book till I was fifteen. It was by Caesar. They laugh
at her careful pronunciation of “Caesar.”</p>
<p><strong>317 ext. train station</strong>: Abby’s train is about to
leave. The CONDUCTOR walks by blowing a whistle. A five-piece BAND plays
Sousa airs. They are practically the only civilians on the platform. The
rest are SOLDIERS bound for Europe, where America has just entered the
War, on fire with excitement and a sense of high adventure.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: I like your hat.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It doesn’t seem like a bird came down and
landed on my head? Abby takes the hat off and gives it to Ursula, who
lately has begun to take more trouble with her appearance, comb- ing her
hair free of its usual snarls. They laugh at their reflection in a
window of the train.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I hardly ever wear it. Be sure and write every
week. Signals nod. A lamp winks. There are leave-takings up and down the
platform as the train slides away. Abby hops on board. A SOLDIER next to
her sheds bitter tears.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: You write me, too! They wave goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>318 ext. arboretum - night</strong>: Late that evening Ursula
lowers herself out a third-floor window of the Arboretum with a rope
made of bedsheets.</p>
<p><strong>319 tight on girls at window</strong>: The other GIRLS stand
in their nightgowns and wave good- bye, amazed at her boldness. She
slips off into the night.</p>
<p><strong>320 ext. backstage door - night</strong>: Ursula looks in a
backstage door. She can see, through the wings, a MAN dancing on stage.
There is a feeling of mad excitement about the place. The person she is
looking for is not here, however.</p>
<p><strong>321 ext. alley - ursula’s theme - night</strong>: She runs
down an alley. A man steps out of the shadows– George, the pilot. She
throws herself in his arms. This is our first sight of him since he left
the bonanza.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: You’re here! Oh, hug me! They kiss madly,
with mystery. The moonlit, midsummer night thrums</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Aren’t we happy? Oh, George, has anybody
ever been this happy? He rocks her back and forth in his arms. They
laugh, thinking what lucky exceptions they are to the world’s
misery.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Hurry. They’ll be looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>322 ext. airplane - dawn</strong>: George bundles Ursula,
giggling, into a biplane.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: This doesn’t even belong to you. Suppose
they catch us?</p>
<p><strong>323 ext. pasture – dawn</strong>: From a pasture outside town
the plane rises into the vast dawn sky.</p>
<p><strong>324 int. textile factory</strong>: Abby changes bobbins on a
huge loom. A pall of lint and anonymous toil hangs over the factory.
Down the way a handsome MALE WORKER smiles at her. She smiles back,
interested.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It seems an age we’ve been apart, and truly is
for those who love each other so. Whenever shall we meet?’</p>
<p><strong>325 tight on machinery</strong>: The shuttle rockets back and
forth. Off camera we hear Abby reading what seems part of a letter to
Ursula. ABBY Soon, I hope, for by and by we’ll all be gone, Urs. Does it
really seem as though we might?’</p>
<p><strong>326 underwater shot</strong>: We look from the bottom of a
river up toward the light. In the foreground, dangling from the tip of a
submerged limb, is the bracelet Abby threw away. ABBY ’The other day I
tried to think how I’d look laid out in a solemn white gown. Closing my
eyes I could almost hear you tiptoe inlook down in my face, so deep
asleep, so still.</p>
<p><strong>327 ext. fields - series of angles</strong>: The PEOPLE of
the Razumihin rebuild the land – raising fences and sinking a well,
plowing down the stubble and putting in the seed. ABBY ‘I went to
Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. It was great as usual. I enclose a
check.’ An ANONYMOUS YOUNG MAN, standing on a carpet of new-sprung
wheat, looks up with a start. From the distance comes a ghostly
noise–the call of the prairie chickens at their spring rites. He listens
for just a moment, then returns to work.</p>
