<p><strong>“route 9”</strong>: Screenplay by Brendan Broderick and Rob
Kerchner</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Maybe this isn’t the right road. There’s
nothing out here –</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: You’re like a broken record. Shut up and
relax!</p>
<p><strong>denning</strong>: We’re on Route 9. This is it. I gotta take
a leak sooo bad…</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: They’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Damn it’s hot…</p>
<p><strong>denning</strong>: Any longer, I’da pissed my pants.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: All right when they get here, we’re gonna
play it cool, do it quick and get the hell out of here before some
six-toes show up with their hats all bent back.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Close the door, you’re letting out the AC
–</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Here they come. A white VAN rises over a
small hill, appearing for a second, and then disappearing again.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Let’s see what you got.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Now all we have to do is test your product
and we’ll all be on our way.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Test the product?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sounds like you don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Standard procedure, bro…</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: …standard procedure.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Are you saying my word is of no value to
you?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Business is business. Now where the hell is
it? I wanna get out of here. That’s the plan, we’re just flunkies, you
know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You didn’t answer my question. Are you
saying my word is of no value to you?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: You said that, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re getting off on a bad foot with me,
son. You see, I don’t like it when people question my integrity. Now
nothing’s going to happen until you answer my question. Is my word of no
value to you?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Your word? Well…let me see… I guess it’s fair
to say I don’t give a flying fuck through a rolling donut about your
word. All right? Does that answer your question?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Now I’m going to test the shit, that was the
plan, and if you have a problem with it that’s too bad. Now where is
it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I have a better plan. You want to hear
it?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I have a better plan.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How about you give us what you have and
leave.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Am I speaking English here?
How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I take it that’s a “no.”</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Oh shit, oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: What is this? Don’t be stupid man…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: First you question my integrity, then you
call me stupid… …that hurts, son.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Four-thirty…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I gotta get ready.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: We still have time.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I have to go to the bank before it
closes.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I gotta take some money out, that’s what
for.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: There’s an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yeah but I need to take out four hundred
dollars and the ATM will only give me three.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Four hundred. Thinking of buying me something
nice?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well, not that I wouldn’t sugar bun but
Earl’s in a bind. They’re going to take his car.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He’s irresponsible.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Ah hell, he’d do the same for me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Has he?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: No. But he would, probably.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I hope you get it back… We could have a lot
of fun with four hundred dollars…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Get a room in a nice hotel for a few
hours…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I might have to look into that…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT SHERIFF’S STATION - EVENING</p>
<p><strong>jesse’s voice</strong>: I tell you, some people are too damn
smart for their own good. Take that case in Richfield.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne’s voice</strong>: The mother son thing…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Soon as they got her on the table they knew
it was murder, stroke or no. I mean, what was this dumb son of a bitch
thinking? Trained professionals wouldn�t find a needle mark in her
arm?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Just goes to show you.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I mean at least pick a more discreet place,
the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the
trained eye won�t immediately look.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Damn it�s hot in here…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: He probably figured she was on her way out
anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Dwayne, I�m telling you a coroner has the
skills and abilities to determine those things. If you pump air into
someone�s vein, a series of traumas occur that are clearly visible upon
dissection.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Very clumsy, very clumsy. I�d have found it
in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: All right you�re the super sleuth, what do
you want, a medal?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No. But what I would like is the forty
dollars you owe me, and I�m a busy man.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Dammit you�re persistent. I don�t want to
listen to this anymore. No more bets with you.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Aw, now that�s gonna take time to clear!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: So what was your point, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: My point? My point is that by analyzing all
the various ways by which we kill each other, it seems to me there is no
perfect crime. We�ll get ya somehow, some way. Except maybe if you use
potassium of something.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much
potassium can kill a man.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You must get a lot of babes with lines like
that.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I think you need to get away from all those
stiffs. Find yourself a little senorita of your own.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Sort of!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Hey Dwayne why don’t you introduce him to
your funeral parlor cousin?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: She’s not his type.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah. That’s all I need, to become one of
your in-laws.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I�m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: All right, deputies, take care, don’t let
your meat loaf.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t worry the real men are in charge
now.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Speaking of which that reminds me I have to
bring something home or eat Sally’s meatloaf again, and I don’t think I
could stand that.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re always griping. Cut her some
slack!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You’ve never had it. It’s exactly like dog
food.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Ready to roll, partner?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Sure thing, and –</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Don’t spend it all in one place.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I knew you’d come through. Jesse observes the
transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What’s that all about?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Drug deal. Pay it no mind.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Fourteen, you out there, copy?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: This is fourteen, what’s up Trudy?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Got a call from Hank Scammel. He’s worried
about Otis. Can’t seem to find him anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He probably died of old age.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: All right Trudy we’ll take a pass down Route
9, see if we can find him.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: He’d appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Don’t be a stranger.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Thanks, Booth. Booth hangs up the radio –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: The horniest dog in Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Thanks for the loan, man. I’ll have it in a
few days, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me
out.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I would have asked my sister, but its better
to leave family out, always leads to trouble.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah…I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the
wheel watcher. He finally got on the show and won seven thousand
dollars! Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?
His excuse was the government got it all.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Seven thousand…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He would have won more but he blew it at the
end. Didn’t know what Cash and Carry was.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Cash and what?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War
two…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh, you would have done great.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I probably would have. I guess the clues damn
near before everyone.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That’s what everyone thinks. But according to
him, when it’s the real thing, it’s quite an intimidatin’ environment in
which to concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He ain’t from around here – He’s deader than
Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Get the car…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: They’re out of towners… Arizona plates…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Jesus, they’re all dead…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well I’ll be damned, I’ve never seen anything
like this… Gangbangers. Must have been a drug deal or something, whaddya
think? Let’s call this in.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I think you better come over here partner…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Holy…shit…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Ten thousand right here.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: There must be over a million dollars in
here.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Shit, more than that.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: This is crazy…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I’m getting some flares…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What do you mean what are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I mean – Earl grabs Booth’s arm –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Call it in I guess. Why?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Why? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: No. We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Look around you partner! You said yourself you
never saw anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We don’t know whose money it is! They might
have robbed a bank, who knows?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Robbed a bank, c’mon! Don’t you think we would
have heard if one, two – shit I don’t know how many were at large! Don’t
you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around
us. Who’s going to know what happened! Let’s take it and get out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well someone’s gonna find them.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hell, it won’t be us!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I told Trudy we were coming down this way,
that’s why!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll figure something out.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: When’s the next time you’ll be face to face
with a couple million dollars in cash, Booth? Never!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We would never have to worry about money –
ever again, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Suppose someone knows about the money?
They’re bound to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Who’s going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It’s going to go bigger than that. Could you
stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’ll worry about that when it happens and if
it happens, and it’s not gonna happen!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What makes you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Because…I know.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It’s no accident we stumbled on this money.
It’s an answer to a prayer! Every night and every day I’ve prayed that
God would just – help me out a little, give me a little push. Tonight my
prayer came true.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Oh so God’s like Western Union and he just
dropped us a couple million bucks?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: At the expense of six people.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: They killed themselves. Besides, they were
breaking the law. What they were doing was wrong! Whatsamatter Booth,
don’t you believe in miracles?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Look, what do you say? If we’re going to do
this we have to do it now.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: All right hold on! Lemme think… Shit, did you
touch the car?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Maybe. Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I do. It’s little shit like that sends people
to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we’re going to pull this!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: All right we will.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll cover all our damn bases…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll torch the bases, how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Torch it?!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll leave a few packets in the trunk, and
stash the rest somewhere else. Car went up in the gunfight.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: C’mon Booth. Let’s do this while we can.
DISSOLVE TO</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Two million eight hundred thousand – sweet
mother we’re millionaires. I’ll leave a couple.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I’ve got one condition.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’re going to be patient. If we start
flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are
going to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, we won’t do any of that shit!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: At least not for now.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Stick the money in our trunk –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You got a match?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Here goes…get back…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: That tank’s gonna blow –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Let’s call this sucker in.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT - LATER</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …just south of mile marker 87 on Route 9.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: If this was a drug deal, where are the
drugs?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: First thing I’m going to do is check out that
new casino, whatever the hell it�s called. Get a nice suite for myself,
some high-priced hookers and some slow-roasted prime rib!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What are you talking about! We have a
deal!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: When the time comes, that is. Hallelujah
Booth! We are rich! RICH!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well, I don’t know. I’m putting it out of my
mind and you should too –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What’s he trying to say!!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know! Son of a bitch! Who the hell are
you?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He saw everything!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: How long you been lying there playing possum
with us, huh? Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He’ll tell them everything to save his ass.
That’s how they all work it!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No…no! No way! That money is in our hands!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What did you hear! How much did you hear!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’re gonna have to get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’m not letting some gangbanger send me to
jail. We can’t risk it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You’re thinking about killing him. I can’t do
that. No way. I’ve never killed a man. Never even shot at one…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well neither have I, but it’s us or him. If he
talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he’s gonna turn us in. Besides,
he’s a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I…I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Okay then. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: That’s not what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking
evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they’d do.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He would have done it to us, right?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Exactly. This is our little secret,
partner.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No one’s gonna miss your ass anyhow!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Dammit help me out here!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on, Booth!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: They’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: What do we have?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Uh, we got a live one here, shot in the throat
–</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Clear me!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Where’s the ambu bag?!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What the hell happened here?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Looks like some kind of drug deal or
something, they’re not from around here – one of them’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Did you move him?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Uh, well he sort of moved himself. I was
trying to stabilize him, clear his throat –</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: He’s lost a lot of oil – can you hear me
buddy?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Maybe he can tell us just what the hell
happened here.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Look at me buddy – focus!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Is he going to make it?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: I don’t know. I’m getting no radial
pulse!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I’d like to know what they were doing in my
town! Did you get ID off any of them?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: None of them had any –</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: OK notify the trauma center team our ETA
is twenty-five minutes –</p>
<p><strong>paramedic 2</strong>: Oh shit. I’m losing the carotid
pulse!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Lift the legs! Come on buddy, fight!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on…buddy…</p>
<p><strong>paramedic 2</strong>: We’re losing him!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on…come on…</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Come on buddy fight! Fight!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic 2</strong>: He’s not going to make it –</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: He’s gone. We lost him.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I want to get some hounds down here.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Cause we got footprints leading into that
brush, I want to see where it leads… Jesus, seven dead. I’ll tell you
I’ve never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of
sheriffing these parts. I don’t like it. Not in my jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: This is gonna be in the papers, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I’ll finish up here. DISSOLVE TO EXT ROAD –
NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I tell you it was a miracle the way things
turned out –</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I don’t want to hear about miracles and God
and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well we didn’t kill him, he died on his
own.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Look. Dwayne was right. This is going to be a
big story. So big in fact that I don’t want to even have this money
around.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Fair enough, I’ll take it to my place.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Forget it. We’re going to bury it, and we’re
not going to even think about it until everything dies down. And no one,
I mean no one hears a word about it. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: A little won’t hurt us.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’re even.</p>
<p><strong>fade out</strong>: FADE IN</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Heard you had quite a night.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It was all over the local news. Dwayne was
there, acting all official.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Nothing’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh. You coming by tonight?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: OK.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are you sure you’re OK?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yeah I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I’m just tired is all. I’ll see you tonight
OK baby?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: OK. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Booth I’m glad you’re here we’ve been
waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: This is Agent Ellen Martin. She’s with the
DEA.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: How are ya?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I guess we can get started.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I wanted to ask you some questions about
last night.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Sure. We’ve all got questions about what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Would you mind not smoking?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you. Now, do you remember seeing any
vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Because someone may have gotten away.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: We had hounds down at the scene, the
footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the
vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I understand that. But from what we know,
there was a large sum of money involved in the transaction, about three
million dollars. It seems to have disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Could it have been in the Mercedes?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Maybe. That’s where it was during Denning’s
last report.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Denning’s their man on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He was the man you tried to save last night.
Agent Paul Denning. We were working together. He was deep undercover
with these dealers for a while. They ran a big operation in Arizona,
Nevada, California.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Normally we would have tracked him with a
wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when
working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days
ago.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You mean that guy was an agent?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes. Wife and a kid. Don’t blame yourself,
Deputy. You did all you could. You have our deepest gratitude…and my
personal thanks.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: In fact, I’ve asked Sheriff Hogan for
permission to enter a letter of commendation in each of your files.
Agent Denning was a good man. I served with him for nearly five
years…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: So I guess we won’t find out what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, we have one lead and that’s what I’m
looking into next.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Denning was wearing a bug.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He kept a recording of all such transactions
in order to keep track of who’s who, what was said, what’s happening. I
contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: That’s news to me. So it’s over at Jesse’s
office?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah. I told him I’d be there before
five.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Excellent. I’ll go down with you.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You boys coming?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll follow in our car.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT ROAD – DAY</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’re dead. We’re dead, We are dead… What are
we going to do?!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: This isn’t a joke. What are we going to
do!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know you want me to put on my cape and
fly there?! We’re going to play it cool… besides there might be nothing
on that tape anyway…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of
the law, just like us.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, we didn’t know that at the time.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No we didn’t. He died on his own.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Oh, right, with a little help from his pals
Booth and Earl. I’m sure that’s gonna fly real far when they hear that
tape…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear
the tape.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Are you nuts? They’ll fry us for sure. There’s
no way we’re doin’ that, you understand? No way.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It’s the stupid thing to do, that’s what it
is.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I should have known something like this was
going to happen!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Man take it easy! You’re sweating like
crazy!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Whatever happens, don’t lose your cool.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: All right gentlemen – maybe this will shed
some light on what took place.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: It’s kind of like those black boxes on the
planes, you know, like the last seconds? I figure most of what they hear
is “AAAAAAAAAAAGH!” What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: This just might be our ticket!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That’s odd.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Maybe the microphone was damaged.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Looks OK to me…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well nothing audible to us. Maybe the lab
can pick something up.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Damn! MARTIN I’m sorry to have dragged you
all the way down here for that. I thought maybe it would help. Booth
lets out an inaudible deep breath – Earl immediately plays up to Martin,
clearly relieved –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What other leads did you come up with?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not too many. But we’re still collecting
evidence from the scene.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well we’d like to help you in any way we
can. We’re all in this together, as law enforcement officers.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT HALLWAY – DAY</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: So what are you doing tonight partner?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’m going out partner. How ’bout you? BOOTH Me
too. CUT TO INT CROWDED BAR – NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: EXT HOGAN HOUSE – NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Come on…I’m sorry. Really I am. Won’t you
open the door?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I’d never do anything to hurt you. You know
that, right?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You just mind that sarcasm. and I’ll mind my
manners. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Now I’ll be back by 10, for the
kiss-and-make-up part. You don’t have to wait up. I’ll wake ya.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Sally?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn’t
gonna leave.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m in here.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You got me something? What’s the
occasion?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You deserve it is the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I tell you I got hard in the store thinking
about you in these!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh
I…nothing…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Nothing happened?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn’t
handle pressure well. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Like hell it’s over. You told me he wasn’t
doing this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He’s not, he’s…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: That son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Booth. Don’t. It’s nothing. It’s not worth
it. Remember what happened the last time?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Let’s not get into this again. I know him. If
you said something, he’d take it out on me.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: And I’d take it out on him.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And I’d end up a widow in two ways. Let’s
forget it. I’ll just be a little more careful next time.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: There isn’t gonna be a next time. We’re gonna
get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And go where? He’d find me. I know you don’t
think so, but he would.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What if we could go really, really far?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: We don’t have to. We’ve got everything we
need right here.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Baby…this must have been expensive.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You’re worth every last penny.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well, I can’t let you down now, can I?</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: INT HOGAN BEDROOM – NIGHT – LATER</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Dwayne’s gonna love me in this.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s a joke, silly.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: How long you been lying there playing possum
with us, huh? Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He’ll tell them everything to save his ass.
That’s how they all work it!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No…no! No way! That money is in our hands!
What did you hear! How much did you hear!</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT JESSE’S HOUSE – NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Shit! We’re gonna have to get rid of him. I’m
not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can’t risk it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You’re thinking about killing him. I can’t do
that. No way. I’ve never killed a man. Never even shot at one.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well neither have I, but it’s us or him. If he
talks, or writes a note or whatever, he’s gonna turn us in. Besides,
he’s just a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Okay then. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: That’s not what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking
evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they’d do.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He would have done it to us, right?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Exactly. This is our little secret,
partner.</p>
<p><strong>fade out</strong>: FADE IN</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: You want to hear the good news first, or
the bad news?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Give me the bad news.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: We retrieved a few things from the trunk,
including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips
and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Anything in it?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: But nowhere near three million dollars
worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: There was more than that.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Not in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That doesn’t tell us much. Did you run a
check on the gas like I told you?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high
octane.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So…what’s the good news?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The car’s a diesel.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: That fire was set. Deliberately. And
probably not by anyone found at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So someone did get away.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: I don’t know how else you’d explain it. The
coroner’s estimated time of death for everyone there was long before
this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn’t
make much sense.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, it doesn’t. Neither does his blank tape.
Any news on that?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: We’re doing a check on the manufacturers’
serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.
What’s your take on these local boys? Are they providing any
answers?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No. I don’t think they see much of this kind
of thing. But they’re going to.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: SHERIFF’S STATION – DAY</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I suppose no man can judge another’s actions
unless he has been in the same situation himself, presented with the
same temptations. And money sure is tempting. Hell, some people will
pretty much do anything for money…lie, cheat, steal, swindle… Jesse
turns and looks –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: …kill. I don’t suppose it would be too hard
to kill a man, especially if he’s half dead, especially if he’s of the
criminal persuasion. How did you know he was a federal officer with a
wife, and a baby on the way?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You gentlemen look like you’re about to toss
your collective cookies.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Why don’t you get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: My point, well…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hey we’re all friends, right? Friends don’t
squeal on friends, that’s not what Jesse Segundo is all about.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Then what the hell are you all about?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Listen Earl. I covered for you. For both of
you. I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don’t pull a hostile
tone with me!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What’s your offer, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: My offer? Well I’d say it’s a fair one, like
I said we’re friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think it’s around here…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: “Two million eight hundred thousand sweet
mother we’re millionaires.”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll settle for a third of that.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence
isn’t exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: True, but neither is attempted murder. In
fact I’d say that’s considerably worse, wouldn’t you, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Besides, I’m not stupid, Earl. The tape was a
basic Maxell D-80. You can buy ’em at any store. There’s no way they can
pin anything on me.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: All right, Jesse, we’ll play it your way,
under one condition.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’re going to wait. All of us, until
everything dies down.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: That’s the deal. If you don’t like it, forget
it, no one wins.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ok…I’ll wait. For now. But I’m going to need
a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I understand your logic, Booth, but I don’t
think…two thousand’s going to raise any eyebrows, do you?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Two thousand…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: By Friday.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Son of a bitch! Did you drop these?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Careful not to get any on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Is this all that’s on?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Here, watch what you want. I’m going to take
a shower.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Aw, where the hell is that thing…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Hey where’s the hot pad?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Where’s the hot back – the therapeutic pad
thing?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I can’t hear a word you’re saying!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What the hell?…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What are you digging around in my closet for?
DWAYNE I was looking for the hot pad!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You mind telling me where the hell this came
from? Is there something I don’t know about?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I mean are you spending my money on other
things I don’t know about? Got any furs in there?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous! It wasn’t so
expensive!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It was going to be a surprise!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: A surprise huh? Well I don’t like any
surprises, especially if I’m forking over the loot for them!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re a real smooth talker, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m saying you’re about as romantic as a bag
of sand.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Watch that. Watch that tone.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I could kill that no good son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: All right enough! I’m tired of thinking about
all this!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well I’m not! Thinks he’s got us by the
balls.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well doesn’t he? Besides if the DEA heard
that tape we’d be behind bars right now. Just call it the cost of doing
business. This whole thing is screwed up. I’m thinking. Maybe we should
tell ’em the truth…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: …Or get rid of the money. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’ve got a better idea. All we have to do is
straighten out Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: And how do you figure we do that?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: All we have to do is get our hands on the
original tape. We’ll set him up somehow.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He’s probably made copies. He’s not going to
give them up to us.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Forget the copies! He could have made up the
copies – the only thing that incriminates us is the original.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He’s going to be trouble.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He’s a partner now, Earl, like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Have you been back here?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah I just took a little out. I’m keeping
track of it, you can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We had a deal! What was I, talking to the
wall?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: For Christ’s sake, Booth, I just needed to
take care of a few debts is all! You got my word on it –I’m not going
near it again until everything cools down.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You said that last time!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well I mean it this time. Come on. Let’s get
this over with!</p>
<p><strong>fade out</strong>: FADE IN EXT WALKING PATH – DAY</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I told him I bought the lingerie, as a
surprise. I don’t think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he
mentions it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: How the hell did he find it?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He started digging through my closet,
something he never does.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Great…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s OK, Booth, it’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Let’s hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I’m
gonna tell him I returned it all.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Dammit, I’m so sick of this.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Every night I think about you sleeping with
him, him slobbering all over you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He doesn’t slobber, he just snores. And I
told you we haven’t…done anything in over a year.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It doesn’t matter…he’s next to you. You know,
I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I used to think he was something, once… I was
eighteen, I didn’t know any better, and he had something steady to
offer.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You get into a routine, after a few years,
when the thrill was gone, I just said to myself this is my destination,
I guess.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And then I met you.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Let’s just get out of here, get out of this –
place. We’ll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite
dish…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I hate it when you talk like this. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’d… I don’t know…go to California, New
York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’d have to be Switzerland to make sure
Dwayne never finds us.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Whatever it takes…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What’s got into you?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I’m bored, you know? I’m frustrated. I want
it to work for us.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I love you Sally.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’re going to figure it out. It won’t be
long. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: A satellite dish?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well I was just throwing out ideas…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT VEGAS STRIP - DAY</p>

<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah whaddya want?.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m at a payphone in Vegas. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by
three o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well, we got the DEA coming down here again,
I don’t know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want
to ask us.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well they really didn’t go into any details
on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to
help them out as best we can.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Uh, sure. I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: So be here at three.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll do my best…that doesn’t give me much
time.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I have complete faith in you. But don’t you
go speeding.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah…see you at three.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hi ma.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: I didn’t know you were coming.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I was in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Is that the mail?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: How’s work?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, same ol’ same ol’.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: People have been asking me about that
story in the paper. I told them you were the first person on the scene.
They were asking me for all the details.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But
you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to
say.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Did they ever find out who they
were?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nope. If you’re a criminal you don’t carry ID,
and if you do you’re a damn fool.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: I tell you this world just keeps
getting more and more violent.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: At least around here it does.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah sure I’ll grab something before I go… Hey
– I’ve got a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You want to see it?</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: There was this raffle going on at the station,
some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the
hell put in my five bucks…</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: And what happened?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well basically I forgot about it, you know,
you never win these things, but this time, well…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I won!</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Well what do you know! An air
conditioner.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: And not just any air conditioner. This baby
sells for over six hundred dollars retail.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: That’s great Earl!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yep, fifteen thousand BTU’s, enough to cool
off this whole place.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: This whole place?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah. Figured you could have it.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Don’t you want it?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Ah, hell I’ll get one soon enough. Besides, I
want you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Well I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’ve done without it long enough, ma.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Just like the commercial says, you deserve a
break today…</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: We can put it in the living room
window… This is great Earl.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: Thank you honey. are you sure you
don’t want it?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Absolutely positively.</p>
<p><strong>earl’s mother</strong>: It will certainly be an improvement…
what was the charity again?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t remember. But I’m glad I gave it a
shot.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT SHERIFF’S STATION – DAY</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Nice of you to join us. I did say three
o’clock, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well I’m here now.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I wanted to meet with you all to go over
some new information about the murders.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Did you find a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Uh, no…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Don’t you think I would have told you
that!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well what is it? MARTIN We discovered
something interesting about the tape Denning was wearing. Based on the
serial number, we’ve determined that the tape was purchased locally.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yeah? So?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s odd. I don’t know how Denning had the
time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well I suppose you would know more about his
situation than us.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What are you getting at?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, unfortunately Denning’s not here to
tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and
switched it.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Why would someone do that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Because they don’t want anyone to hear
what’s on it, obviously.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well, like you said, he’s not here to tell
us.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That’s true…that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Something wrong, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You walked in here looking like you just ate
a shit sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind
is all.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What do you think about all this?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hell, I don’t know. If I had some input I’d
offer it up.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We gotta roll anyhow. How long is this going
to take?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Whatsamatter with you? Aren’t you concerned
about all of this?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I can’t get enough of it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Anything else we can do for you? MARTIN Well,
I wanted to ask you a few more questions, but I have to go. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thanks for coming down.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: We just got started, where you headed off
to?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh that was Agent Wallace. We’re going to
check into something.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Maybe I should come along.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t you have to be here?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Hell no. besides I’m just a radio call away
if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens,
seeing it’s my jurisdiction and all.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mm-hmm…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Look, agent Martin…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Ellen…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Ellen… I know you might think this is a
small town, and we do things a certain way, but I don’t want you to
confuse that with…a lack of resolve.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I don’t like people getting away from me,
and I’m prepared to scour the earth for whoever did it. I want you to
know that.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ok, sure. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Just do it! Meet me there, now.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: There’s going to have to be a change in our
arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What are you proposing?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I want my share. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m not asking.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well you’re not getting, either.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Listen -</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t like getting grilled by that DEA
bitch, I don’t like taking that kind of heat!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: None of us like it!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well I don’t know what’s going to happen next
– she’s pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Just take it in stride.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m not gonna take – I’m not gonna take it in
stride. I had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me
out.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What do you mean? You gambled it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I was on a roll! I�m a little overextended
now.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: So I want the money and I want it now.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well you can’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Look…I can turn that tape over to Martin and
come out smelling like a rose, you understand that Earl? So I’m going to
make you a final proposition. I want two million dollars tonight, or the
tape goes into her hands tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yeah, I mean you’re coming unglued,
Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You want to see how more unglued I can get?
Try me.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re never getting that much.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think I am.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll give you until nine o’clock tonight to
bring it to my house. Jesse look at the table –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hope you don’t mind picking up the tab.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You think he’s bluffing?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all
messed up…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: If you’re any friend at all, you’ll stop
talking like that!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a
third in exchange for the tape.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t think he’s going to be doing any
bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch! Besides, I’m not giving
him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Well what are we supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know…we have to shut him up somehow.
Booth looks at Earl –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Jesse’s a reckless guy, Booth. Got a lot of
monkeys on his back. Who knows, maybe it all catches up with him
somehow.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: How badly do you want that money?! How bad do
you want to stay out of jail?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Not bad enough to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Who said anything about killing? Just keep
driving straight…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The
bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop. Came through a store
called After Midnight. There’s only four employees, none of them can
tell us who passed them.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Is this marked money, or what?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Some of it. Denning only handled a small
portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: So there was money there! Who the hell’s
money is it?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We don’t know. Whoever got this payload
together has one hell of a laundering system.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Have you known this all along?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well you can understand why we didn’t say
anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only
work against us.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well yes I understand that, we don’t want
them high-tailing it out of here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sheriff Hogan –</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Dwayne.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Dwayne… It is imperative that we keep this
confidential. Now we know someone’s out there. Very close. It may even
be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Fine. The information doesn’t leave this
room.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: I’m not gonna say anything!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Yeah – this is confidential.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: OK…this is good. Our first solid lead.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Did you say After Midnight?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: What the hell is that, some kind of porno
store or something?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Not exactly. It’s some lingerie store on
the strip.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Lingerie…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind,
right?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Sure… DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE –
NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: All right what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Nothing. Nothing’s the matter. SALLY Aren’t
you going to tell how your day went?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Not much to tell. Nothing really
happened.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That hasn’t stopped you before.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Funny…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Suppose I’m not exciting enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I didn’t say that. You did.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well you might as well say it. Mister Small
Time…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Just trying to be civil Dwayne.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t you want to hear about my day?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Yeah let’s hear about your day.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well I got the tires rotated, I went
shopping, and I made dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And a flying saucer landed in the backyard,
aliens abducted me, performed experiments, and let me go.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well it sounds like you had quite a full
day.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Whatever…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Look I worked all day, I’m tired as hell and
I want to sit and eat in peace! Is that asking too much?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a
six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass
out. And do it all over again tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Save me the sermon. I’ve heard it all
before, it’s boring.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It certainly is…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Perfect. He’ll freak when he sees this.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I was beginning to think you weren’t going to
show. That can’t be all of it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: No. It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What’s…what’s with the gloves?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Sit down, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You know, I had a feeling you just might pull
something like this, some hard-ass tactic.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Don’t you think I’d be prepared?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Sit down, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re not going to shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nah, I guess I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What the hell are you doing, you crazy some
bitches –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’re gonna talk.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t suppose you’ll tell us where the tape
is.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well it’s not here – you’re wasting your time
and you’re pissing me off!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What the hell!!!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t know what the hell you’re doing but
you’re as good as dead now!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What the hell is this shit!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re the only person I know on Earth who
smokes this bullshit brand!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: If anything happens to me I got people who’ll
go straight – straight to a safety deposit box and they’ll find out
everything!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You don’t expect us to believe that do
you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You better believe it if you know what’s good
for you!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: See that’s the problem with you. You got a big
mouth. A big fat mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Get me out of this! Get me out of this
asshole!! You try anything, you’ll leave a thousand clues. We find ’em
all the time. We’re trained for it.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: So are we, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Dammit settle him down!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: How long is it going to take?!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know! Shit, give me a break!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Come on, Booth. Don’t let him do this!!!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Don’t have much choice, Jesse. You saw to
that!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re only screwing yourselves over!
Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Shut up, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: HELLLLLP!!!!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No one’s gonna hear you, Jesse. We’re in the
middle of nowhere!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Look, get him up, all right?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We gotta, Jesse. It’s tough, but you didn’t
leave us any choice. We gotta know where the tapes are.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much
potassium can kill a man. Just have to…pick a discreet spot.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Stop! Stop! I don’t need the money. You can
have it all.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Where’s the tape? Where are the copies?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: THERE AREN’T ANY COPIES! THERE’S JUST THE
ORIGINAL, AND I’LL TAKE YOU THERE!!!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m not convinced…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Whoa, Earl!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: OKAY! IT’S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE
BOTTOM SIDE!!!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What are you doing, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What are you thinking? We were only supposed
to scare him!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’m just making our intentions clear. Go check
the desk.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: See, I’m telling the truth!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: There it is…now what about the others?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: There are no others, Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Earl!!!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know that. Deep down, you know it.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Even if we have the tape, that wouldn’t shut
him up!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You killed him…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It’s gonna be o.k.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Like hell it is. This is Jesse! Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know there’s no other way.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What’s going on? What’s happening to us??</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You…stupid….</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t start losing it on me Booth! Do you
understand what I’m saying!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Jesus Christ Earl…what are we doing?…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’re doing what we gotta do, to protect
ourselves!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You don’t know if he was really gonna –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yes I DO! It never woulda stopped, you know
that. Jesse’s always gonna be making mistakes and we’d be paying for
them for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Now you have to get it under control. We gotta
get out of here, we gotta set him up just right and you can’t come apart
on me now! Booth takes a very deep breath –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Now are you under control?</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT JESSE’S HOUSE – NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Maybe we should say somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on. Booth grabs the bag –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Do you have everything?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I sure as hell hope so. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: EXT STREET – DAY</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Anything I can help you with?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well I just uh, you know…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I have an anniversary coming up, thought I’d
buy her something special.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Anything…specific?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I mean, how much is something like that?</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: This is…65 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Sixty five… Jeez Louise!</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: We are having a sale on some items over
here –</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Do you know her sizes?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Uh, well I don’t know her specific
sizes…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Maybe I can give you an idea…</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: She’s pretty…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Yeah, she is. She comes up to about here on
me.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I don’t suppose you’ve seen her.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Have I seen her?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Shopping here?</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: No, I can’t say that I have.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Let’s see…do you know her cup size?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Uh…C?</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: C?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Yeah I’d say C…C.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Do you know…34 C? 32 C?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: No I don’t. You sure you haven�t seen
her?</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Well…I should have done a little homework,
getting all the sizes, and what not.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I’m just not very good…with all of this
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Oh, that’s ok, a lot of men feel
uncomfortable when they come in here.</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: A lot of men come in here?</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Oh yeah. Between here and Vegas we get
a lot of customers. All types. Even had an officer, just like you.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yeah, I’ve seen him.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What did he buy?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I don’t remember. We get a lot of people in
here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Could it have been this?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I really don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: When was the last time he was here?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Not too long ago.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Be more specific. A month, a week…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: A week ago, at most.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thanks for your time.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Whoa…whoa…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Wait – hey what’s this all about!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: He didn’t make it into work, and he’s not
home.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: You think he skipped town?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We’re going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Dwayne? Trudy?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Dwayne’s not here, Earl. He went down to the
bank with those government people.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: The bank?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Yeah. That’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: How are we going to do all this?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I’m going to quit. That’s what has to happen
first. Then we’re going to tell him.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I don’t know, Booth.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I’ll be there for you. He won’t try anything
while I’m there. I promise. I’ll protect you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: When do you expect this inheritance stuff to
be straightened out?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Shouldn’t be long. A couple of weeks
maybe.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Can you rely on how much they said you’d
get?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It’ll be more than enough. We can get out of
here…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: What do you think? Heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Get Sheriff Hogan down here, somebody,
anybody let’s lock it down here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: This isn’t right…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: I’m not getting an answer.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not getting an answer? For Christ’s sake!
Call 911! Let’s get it locked down here!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Wallace? Get over here. Wallace looks at the
pack with Martin.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You take Jesse’s car outside. Head to the
station, detain Deputy Whitney if he’s there. I’ll go to his
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Why does that bother you?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m not sure why. It’s just, I’ve never been
anywhere else…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Sally there’s a whole world out there. We can
have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you
giving up?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I don’t know. My friends…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’ll meet new people. You might have friends
out there you never met.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yeah, I guess you’re right. It’s just…all so
sudden…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yeah, it is…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Booth. We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What do you mean, traceable?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know for sure, but why else would they
head for the bank?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It was all used. Random numbers. How can they
trace it?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know. They got all kinds of high-tech
shit nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Then we’re screwed.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’re not? How do you figure that?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll take the money and disappear! We can do
it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it’s marked, there’s ways
around it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’ve got to go now, then.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Then Sally comes too.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: All right, Sally comes too. I’ll be right
there. You just hang tight, partner.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Do you wanna tell me what that was all
about?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yeah. I want to tell you everything.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Things just got a little screwed up, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I swear to you, it’s true…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’ll disappear and he’ll be out of our lives
forever.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Sally, do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You know I do.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Then take this chance. Take it with me…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Now just take it easy Dwayne –</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Dwayne put the gun down –</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Shut up!!! Slut!!!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You’d do this to me?!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Dwayne -</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: You’d do this to me!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Come on! Come on scumbag!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Put…the gun…down…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Shit. Shit shit shit!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: I should kill you right here! I never
thought you’d do this to me but I guess there’s a lot I didn’t know
about you!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Dwayne listen to me -</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Shut up! Not another word out of you! You’re
going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn’t know some of it was
marked, did you! Where’s the rest?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I don’t know what you’re -</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Don’t lie to me!!!!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Dwayne please calm down!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: Calm down –</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: How’s that??! How’s that for calm??!</p>
<p><strong>dwayne</strong>: How’s that, you –</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Stop! Stop!!!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Sally! Oh my God, oh my God –</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Don’t die on me, don’t die on me, don’t die
on me –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He killed her…he killed her…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What happened? What’s Earl doing here?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He found us, he shot her…he killed her…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Booth, listen to me…Booth!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: He killed her…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We got to get out of here. Do you understand?
We got to get out of here right now!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: No. It stops now. It stops here.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What do you mean? Look. We can make still make
it work.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Dwayne’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I know, I know. Dwayne’s dead, but we can deal
with it. We’ll pin it on him. The DEA was driving Jesse’s car. No car
phone. No radio. They couldn’t have called me in.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It’ll look like Dwayne killed them, then came
to kill you, too. Self - defense. Sally just got caught up in it.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us. He
was at the scene. He grabbed the cash. Of course. This is perfect!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Are you nuts? Sally’s dead! Dwayne’s dead.
Jesse’s dead! There’s no walking away from this! It is OVER! Do you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’ll need the money.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It’s too late…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It’s NOT too late!</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Yes it is. I’m calling it in. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: We’ve been making the wrong moves all along.
It’s time to make the right one.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re the one who’s nuts! There’s no one left
to touch us, Booth. We’re home free! We just plant a little of the money
on Dwayne, and it’s all ours.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: It’s not about the money anymore. Can’t you
see that? It’s about</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Just one more. This one knocks off all the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I can’t. I can’t go on. I can’t keep
lying…killing. That’s not me. That’s not US.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You gonna shoot me, partner? Is that what
you’re gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: No. No, I’m not. The killing stops here.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: You do what you gotta do, Earl. You take it
all if you want. But I’m going in.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That’ll bring me down, too. Eventually. You
gotta know that.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: And you’re solid on that?</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: Rock solid.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Officer, follow me.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Stay here, with your gun trained on that
door, until backup arrives.</p>
<p><strong>booth</strong>: I know you’re gonna kill me for this,
partner, but your debts are pretty big, and this money is a real
temptation. It’s not that I don’t trust you. I just know how tough
things have been for you recently, and I’ll keep helping out all I can.
I buried the money somewheres else, and as soon as this blows over, you
and I will go dig it up together. Hope you aren’t too mad. You’re my
partner, come hell or high water, and I’m only doing this for the both
of us.</p>
