<p><strong>prince of thieves</strong>: Story by Pen Densham</p>
<p><strong>first draft</strong>: Trilogy Entertainment Group in
association with: July 10, 1990</p>
<p><strong>warner bros. inc. � 1990</strong>: 4000 Warner Boulevard
WARNER BROS. INC. Burbank, California 91522 All Rights Reserved</p>
<p><strong>sunset</strong>: The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red
eye.</p>
<p><strong>black, robed figure</strong>: A face of the ages. Dark,
wrinkled skin. Wizened, almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice
ECHOES across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer. Hundreds of feet below
his tower, a mud-walled city of minarets and mosques. A human ants’
nest. Scurrying to their devotions.</p>
<p><strong>int. dungeons - sunset</strong>: Pervasive blackness. Moans
of men in pain. Dripping water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human
degradation. Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two crusaders from their
cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long
imprisonment, but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in
their faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: He says you stole his bread.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It is a lie. I caught him stealing ours.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Cut off the infidel’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No!… I took the bread.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They’re not interested in truth. You are too
weak, Peter. You would not live through it.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Sacrifice for the weaker? How noble…
As you wish… Cut off this one’s hand as well!… But first…</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Show them the courage of Allah.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: And this is English courage.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s for five years of hell.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A jailer aims a scalding blade at
Robin’s back.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You speak English?</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: The king’s own. Set me free.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, Robin.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: For pity’s sake. Mine is a sentence of
death.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t trust him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What I would give for an English sword. This
is a pruning hook.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Hmm! Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Free me and I will show you a way out.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Why should we trust you?</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: If you don’t, you are dead men.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: He makes a point.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: A good point.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Robin!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not
deserve to die here.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>int. sewers - night</strong>: They wade through foul water up
to their waists. The Saracen leads… A snake lashes out for his face.
Robin lops off its head.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: You are fast, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Five years I’ve waited for the smell of free
air. That makes a man fast.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: You will need to be yet faster.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Poison air. Hold your breath.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks. I misjudged you.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Save your breath.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Allah be praised.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Amen, brother.</p>
<p><strong>ext. arab street - night</strong>: Robin’s head appears…
ducks back down, as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him…
he reappears. All clear. They’re outside the prison wall. Robin helps
Peter up.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: God willing, we may now be safe.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter’s
chest – fired from the prison wall. He reels… Robin leads him under the
wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers approaching.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Come, Peter. We must hurry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It is mortal. Leave me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Hold on to my shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My mother… my little sister. Tell them I love
them. Tell them I died a free Englishman.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: His wound is by the heart. We cannot save
him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Take this to my sister. Swear you will
protect her for me… Swear it, Robin!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For England.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Come now! Do not fail your friend. Make his
sacrifice an act of honor.</p>
<p><strong>deserted alley - later</strong>: Robin and the Saracen catch
their breath.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Farewell, friend. God speed you on your
way.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Our way is together. With the speed of
Allah.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I go to England.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Then I go to England.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: England? Why?</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: You saved my life. I must stay with you
until I save yours.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Go your own way. I relieve you of your
obligation.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: Only Allah can do that.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: And if I don’t want you?</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: You have no choice… unless you think you
can kill me.</p>
<p><strong>saracen</strong>: My name is Aslan.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to
England, Aslan?</p>
<p><strong>ext. locksley castle</strong>: Eerie shapes. Weaving. White
light on water. The moon reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers
shrouded in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.</p>
<p><strong>int. locksley castle - night</strong>: FIRE CRACKLES in an
open hearth. Hams and a half sheep hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at
the fireside. A bone clunks on the floor, waking him.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Enough of that din, Remus. I can’t think.</p>
<p><strong>locksley.</strong>: Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand,
he pores over a wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the vast table. A deep sense
of loneliness. He glances at a portrait over the fireplace… Robin. The
dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley unsheathes a dagger.
Obscures it in the folds of the Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant,
ragged, desperate, KENNETH.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: My Lord! Help me.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You must wait… I am sorry you were
disturbed, Master.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: My Lord, please!</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: It is alright, Duncan. You are Kenneth of
Cowfall?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: They’ve taken my Gwen. My daughter.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Who has taken her?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Men on horses. In masks. We tried to stop
them. My son is dead.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You cannot go alone, Master. Let me ride for
help.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: That may be too late. Kenneth, lead the
way.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Master, stay! There is an evil moon
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Good will overcome, Duncan. Trust in
that.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wooded trail</strong>: Kenneth checks the ground.
Locksley waits.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: They came this way, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Onward then. What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Nearby the Gregor Caves.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Steady, man. They are to dissuade the
faint of heart. Think of Gwen.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Druids.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: I trusted we were rid of such evil a
century ago.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Is it the devil?</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: If it is, I have some Christian steel that
will test his hide.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Gwen?</p>
<p><strong>demon</strong>: Come, my virgin flower.</p>
<p><strong>demon</strong>: Kill him! Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Gwen! Up, girl, up!</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: In the name of God!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The head is an elaborate mask – beneath
are the yellow skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed. Momentarily stunned,
Locksley regains his senses, hauls the girl onto his charger. The guards
close in. Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening. The masked
high priest stands resolutely in his path. Brandishing a burning branch.
The horse is freaked. Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown. Unarmed,
Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the cave wall. The mask falls.
Locksley gasps in recognition.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Nottingham!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: You are an unwelcome surprise,
Locksley.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: The King shall hear of this,
Nottingham.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: I think not.</p>
<p><strong>locksely</strong>: God help us.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: One day all England will worship with
us.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>demon</strong>: I am Mortianna. You will die with my name on
your lips.</p>
<p><strong>ext. english shore - day</strong>: A twelfth century French
sailboat at anchor. A cross on its sail. A longboat rows to shore. Robin
stands in the prow, in a pilgrim’s hooded robe. He gazes at the
approaching land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades to
the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face into the soil.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Home. Thank you, Lord.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg
you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy
your heart must be, this far from your family and native land…</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Because I love them so dearly, I cannot
dishonor them.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I thought you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: No man controls my destiny. Especially not
one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: If our positions were reversed, I would have
done the same. Only I would have succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate
your honor when we dine with my father.</p>
<p><strong>ext./int. peasant’s cottage - day</strong>: CRASH! An armored
foot splinters the door of a farmer’s hovel. Children scream and run. A
soldier clubs at them, laughing. Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses,
others on foot, with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.</p>
<p><strong>guy gisborne</strong>: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome – except that one of his ears is missing. We
recognize his face from the Druid ceremony. He coldly addresses a
pregnant woman with a child in her arms, FANNY.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: You owe the sheriff three bushels of
flax.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: You starve us. First the drought, now you
take what food we have left.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: For starving people, you look fat
enough.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: He’s not here, sir. None but the woman and
children.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Where is your mate? The man they call
Little.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: He died last winter.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Is that so? We hear he is very much alive.
Hiding out in the forest. He probably ran away to escape your scolding
tongue.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Norman swine!</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: No, Wulf! Don’t! ’Twill only make it
worse.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Seize him!</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: This is Lord Nottingham’s deer. Is this
how you repay the Sheriff for his protection?</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: Like a wolf protects sheep.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: I killed it. We needed the meat.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Poachers hang. Either he dies or you
die.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: My mother lies to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: No, Wulf!</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: You have deprived us of a hunt, boy.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: The hounds know the scent well.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us some
pleasure before you die.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS’
savage HOWLS and the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Unleash them!</p>
<p><strong>ext. country road - dusk</strong>: Nearing home, Robin is
buoyant. The Saracen, brooding, walks two paces behind him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Why must you walk in back of me?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: In your land am I not the infidel? The
unbeliever, the instrument of evil?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Our races have fought for a hundred years to
prove that point.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Then I trust it is safer to appear as your
slave than as your equal.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: For an ‘infidel’ you have uncommon clarity of
thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Those are my burdens.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You speak my language. You have the diplomacy
and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be
executed?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: So, I must continue with my guesswork. You
are highborn? Probably… You fell from favor… Clearly… Why? You broke the
law? You were a rival for power? … A woman?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Saracen reacts, almost
imperceptibly.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: By the Lord, that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They say there are Arab women of such beauty
that they can possess a man’s mind, that he would be willing to die for
them. Is that not so?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: It is close to sunset.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Your people must marry women chosen for them
by others, right?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Who is she? The Mullah’s daughter? … Another
man’s wife?… That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Endless clouds. Is there no sun in your
cursed country?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You dog! You painted old dog! What is her
name?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Which way is East?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Her name?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: East?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Her name?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: East?!!!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Damn you!… Jasmina.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ah, Jasmina! Is she beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Which way is East?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I would know blindfolded. I’m five miles from
home… Was she worth it?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Worth dying for.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: You’re not playing by the rules, boy. Deer
don’t climb trees… Perhaps he thinks he’s a game bird. Shall we teach
him to fly? Cut it down!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Hold!… I am curious as to what manner of
creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Stand back, stranger. This is no affair of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see…
Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: I advise you to move on, pilgrim. This is
the Sheriff’s land.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Wrong. This is my land, and my tree.
Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: I grow dangerously tired of your wit… Chop
it down!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The man who strikes that tree dies.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Chop down the hooded fool.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Perhaps we could discuss this.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aslan! It’s time to redeem that vow.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Set the dogs on him!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Aslan ignores him, lost in his prayers.
Robin lifts the other arm – a second concealed crossbow. WHUMPF! The
bolt flips the dog handler into the vicious pack. Dead or not, he soon
will be. Robin unsheathes his sword.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aslan, get off your damn knees! I have four
of them cornered.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I hope there’s enough of me to satisfy you
all.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aslan!!</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Well, hooded stranger, allow me to know
your name before I run you through.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Robin of Locksley!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: On your knees, Gisborne. Pray.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Please, Locksley! No!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Now get off my land. And tell your cousin the
Sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You worthless savage! You travel ten thousand
miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I will fulfill my vow when I choose.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Which does not include prayer times, meal
times, or any time I’m outnumbered six to one!!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You whine like a mule. You are still
alive.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Barely.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: A flesh wound. Why did you let their leader
go?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: After six years of the stench of death, I
have no stomach for needless blood on my hands.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Have no fear, boy.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: The conquering hero returns.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ha! It was you he was scared of.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Come, my strange friend. Beyond that hill
lies the prettiest little castle in all Christendom. Warm hearths, hot
food, real beds.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: With feather pillows?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: With feather pillows. Warm and soft like
Jasmina’s embrace.</p>
<p><strong>ext. locksley castle - night</strong>: Ruins. The moon hovers
ominously over the once-proud castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and
deserted. Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck dumb
with horror. The dark courtyard. Heartsick, Robin stumbles over
debris.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Father! Hello!</p>
<p><strong>close - medallion</strong>: round the corpse’s neck. The
Locksley crest.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I should have been here.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Damn you, Duncan. Why didn’t you cut him
down?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Master Robin, is it you? A miracle. I
thought God had abandoned us.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You left my father to hang like a common
thief, carrion for the crows.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Easy… Look at him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What has happened?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: They say they captured him worshipping with
the Druids. He signed a confession before the Bishop of Hereford.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Did they have witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall. The Bishop
decreed all the Locksley lands forfeit.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Did you believe the charges?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Not even when they took my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Who did this to you, Duncan?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff looking
on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nottingham castle - night</strong>: Marked contrast. A
forbidding fortress. Cliff-like battlements.</p>
<p><strong>int. nottingham castle - night</strong>: Face like thunder,
Guy of Gisborne strides up curving, stone steps. A long corridor leads
to a guarded oak door.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to be
disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Away, fool.</p>
<p><strong>ext. castle battlements - night</strong>: Torches illuminate
Nottingham’s face. Chilling cruelty in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his
manicured hand dis- tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his
feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she covers up.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Who bade you cover up?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Cousin, I trust you justify your
intrusion with news of profound value.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: I met a hooded man today. He bade me warn
you not to harm his people.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: His name?</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Robin of Locksley.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Ha! The prodigal son returns. He is a
whelp. This girl could best him.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: This whelp bested five of my men in the
blink of an eye.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Your men were probably drunk. Yet you
survived, cousin?</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: You brought her here?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Change the seat of power.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: London?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Change it.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Move the capitol to Nottingham?
Excellent. How?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Ally with royal blood.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Put someone on the throne and rule
through him? Who?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: That is not revealed.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Ally with royal blood. What else do you
see?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Armies.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Yours. Men and weaponry in great
numgers.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: And victory?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Much blood will be spilled.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: A dice splashes blood. Lands – a death’s
head symbol. Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands
again. Again the grinning skull.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The tray smashes to the ground. The
hag runs at Gisborne.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Who have you seen?!</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: No one. I have seen no one.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: You lie! A man… A painted man.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: What is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: I have seen my death.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: The painted man. He haunts my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Locksley has a companion. A dark- skinned
foreigner. He had the marked skin of Islam.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Kill them! Kill them!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Cousin. Prove to Locksley that your
survival was his last mistake.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: And the painted man! Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Kill them both.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: You have done well, Mortianna.
Exceedingly well. No one shall harm you, I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it…
and bites down viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Now, my child, Mortianna’s kisses will
seem soft, like an angel’s. Take her. You have earned her.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: It is madness bringing the hag here.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For in
madness, there is great power.</p>
<p><strong>ext. locksley castle - dawn</strong>: Red shards of sunlight
slice through mist-shrouded trees. Robin hammers a crude cross over a
hillside grave. Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Our last words in this world were spoken in
anger. He called the Crusades a foolish quest, said it was vanity to
force other men to our religion. He was right. Please forgive me,
Father.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: He loved you till the end, young master. He
never gave up hope of your return.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I failed him. I should have been here at his
side.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You must leave, head north to safety.
Gisborne will surely seek revenge.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Leave me.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I know what you’re thinking. But one man can
achieve nothing against so many. You would need an army.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Leave me.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Come, friend.</p>
<p><strong>grave side - later</strong>: Pouring rain. Robin stands
drenched at the grave side. Aslan watches from the shelter of trees.
Duncan heats a stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: He still stands vigil?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Like a rock.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: A curse on the Saracens! Were it not for
their ungodly ways, he would never have left. This would never have
happened.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: It surprises me that one who curses others so
readily has lived so long.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I do not recognize the style of your voice,
friend. Are you Irish? A Cornishman?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Er… no.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What manner of name is Aslan then?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: A fine Saracen name.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Lord, no!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I take no
offense. By the prophet! What is the man doing?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I swear by my own blood. I will not rest
until I have restored my father’s name. … Or until I am dead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest path - day</strong>: Ooze sucks at feet. The
three men stomp through mud and rain.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We make a fine army, do we not, Duncan? A
blind man, an Arab, and a fool.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: A fine, wet army. I have never witnessed a
storm of such duration. When does summer come to this land?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: This is summer.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Then Allah truly is great.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Why, pray?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: No food, no shelter, and weather that would
curse the end of the earth. We will all quickly be dead, and I shall be
rid of my vow.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find
food and shelter here among friends.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Peter’s home. It is nearly seven years since
we left here together.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dubois mansion - day</strong>: Robin pounds on the door.
A hatch opens. An OLD WOMAN’s face.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: No beggars!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Tell the mistress of the house that Robin of
Locksley is at her door.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Her ladyship is not at home.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aagh!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Is the child Marian at home?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Maybe she is. Maybe she isn’t. Remove
that hand.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: The hospitality here is as warm as the
weather.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Leave your weapons.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Just you.</p>
<p><strong>int. dubois mansion - day</strong>: The hall. Deer heads.
Boar heads. Portraits of ancestors.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I am Robin of Locksley.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You lie. Robin is dead.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I may meet my maker soon from lack of
sustenance. But for now I am real enough.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Step into the light. Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: By heaven, am I to dance next? Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I am the maid Marian.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Then show yourself, child. For we knew each
other well.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: With the king away, these are lawless times.
There are outlaws villainous enough to kidnap and ransom a relative of
his.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You know I am not one of them. Besides, I am
sworn to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Protect me? Robin of Locksley was nothing but
a spoiled bully.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Allow that years of war and prison may change
a man. Step forward, Marian, so I may see how you have changed.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Er… the years have been kind.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thank you. Now remove yourself from this
household.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: As you can see, we are already well
protected.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Wait, Marian! …ouch!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The sword is jabbed into his back.
Robins faces the man – clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You are truly courageous against an unarmed
man.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: The SOUND of the fight indoors. Aslan hurls
himself at the door. It doesn’t give.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and
thrusts. The horns get shorter. Robin retreats. Left with just the nubs,
Robin hurls the deer head at the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges.
Grabs the dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops. Robin
wrenches off the mask. Long hair tumbles down… a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.
The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through… just in time to see the
woman’s knee fly up into Robin’s crotch. Robin folds. The battle is
over. The young woman stands over Robin.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: As she was saying, we have no need of
your protection.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Marian.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen</strong>: Liquid tumbles into a goblet. The
three men at a table in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be
Marian, serves. Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin –
“Help!” Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An impish grin.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I trust Lord Locksley has recovered from his
indisposition.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dubois mansion - day</strong>: Rock-strewn hills.
Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger
and anguish in her voice.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Why would he wish me to be protected by the
boy who burned my hair when I was a child?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We were together five terrible years in a
Saracen prison.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: How do I know you didn’t abandon him there
to save your own skin.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Marian, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I will forward your condolences to my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: On my return, I found my father dead. The
Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: The people fear the Druids so much they’d
believe anything. Nottingham would have me burned at the stake as a
witch if he thought he could possess my property.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Why do you not join your mother in London?
You would be safer there.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I will not retreat. Besides, I have no
interest in life at court. Gossip-mongering and currying favor. Here I
am my own person.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The you must allow me to be your
guardian.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I do not need a guardian.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: My brother is dead. You cannot take his
place.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Marian, I don’t want to replace him.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: This is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Robin! The old man hears horses. Approaching
fast.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Twenty or more. In battle armor.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Soldiers coming here? Is this your
protection?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I killed some of the Sheriff’s men. I fear I
have placed you in danger.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I can take care of myself. There are horses
in the stable. Go!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m not leaving.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Stop them! They’re stealing my horses!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: He can ride.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: You have been sheltering outlaws, Lady
Marian.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: They’re thieves, you imbecile. Bring back my
horses, or the Sheriff will know of your cowardice.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: You’re lucky he didn’t steal your virtue
too. A crown to the man who brings me Locksley’s head.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Kiss this!</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Try me again, if you want to leave a hand
behind.</p>
<p><strong>ext. stream</strong>: Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords
a stream. Duncan hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half
a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men. Trying for a short cut, Robin
finds himself at the steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks
at the drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It backs
away.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Damn you, animal!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Treat it like a woman.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Have you never had a woman? Gently, man.
Soothe it!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Of course I’ve had a woman! Come on, pretty
one.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Softly. With your knees.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I know! I know!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Easy, easy.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I love you!</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Robin of the Hood! Son of the devil
worshipper.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What is your pleasure, Gisborne?</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: It was I who strung your father’s corpse
to the castle gate. My pleasure will be in doing the same to you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You survived one meeting. Our next will be
your last.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Your father died a coward, cursing your
name and squealing like a stuck pig.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: That’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Incensed, he is losing his
judgement.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Come, Robin! He is trying to anger you into a
trap.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We have lost them. I’ll lame this mare if I
ask her to go any farther.</p>
<p><strong>scope pov</strong>: Through the scope we see the movement on
the hill behind them.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Here they come. Look.</p>
<p><strong>scope pov</strong>: The soldiers are close!</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: He reacts in shock. Prepares to
defend himself. Then realizes they are still in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Is this Arab magic?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: No. Arab science.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: How did your uneducated kind ever take
Jerusalem?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: God knows!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We can lose them in the forest.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Sherwood is haunted, Master.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Either we take our chances with the ghosts,
or become ghosts ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They’re not following.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Come on, damn you! There are only three of
them.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: It’s not the men we fear, sir.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Banshees. They say they fly in your mouth
and suck you dry of blood before you can scream.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Be quiet! Listen.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Allah protect us from the evil spirits.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No, there! And there!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Cease your mad laughing. I can feel them.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child’s toy
put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Ring around the rosie!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aslan!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger,
keeping their distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to grab
him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall down.
Beg for mercy, rich man.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I beg of no man. Which of you scum has guts
enough to face me man to man?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yeah, bollocks, mate.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: What are ya, m’old cock?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Er… Robin…</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: …Hood. Robin Hood. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: John Little. Bestman o’ the woods.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Bestman? You lead this rabble?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: We waste time. Tax him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Tax? For what?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: For passage through Sherwood.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I will pay no tax. Besides, I have nothing
but my cloak and my sword.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: A man who travels with two servants
and claims he’s without money, is either a fool or a liar.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: And this one is a liar. Ahah!
Gold!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: That is sacred to me.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Sacred to us too, mush. This here’ll
feed us for a bloomin’ month.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You will have to fight me for it.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: I’d love to, mate.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: Wait, father! I know him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: This man is your father? Tell him how I saved
your hide from the Sheriff’s soldiers. That deserves some gratitude, I
believe.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Naw ya don’t, laddie.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: You must be Robin of Locksley. The
blackguard who abandoned us to Nottingham’s plundering.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: Be careful, Father. He fights like a demon. He
walloped six o’ Sheriff’s men?</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aslan!</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Oh dear! The little rich boy is lost
for words. Thanks for the taxes, Locksley.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: And for the laughs.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Son of an Arab whore! Once again your
assistance was invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You seemed more in danger of losing your
pride than your life.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I recognized some of the voices. Many were
from your father’s farms.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Your avenging army, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: That rabble?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: All they need is a leader.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They have a leader. A very large one.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Defeat him and they will follow you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Allah has taken your brains.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I hear the voice of a spoiled child, Master
Robin. I suggest you cease your brave talk of revenge and flee to the
north.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You, too? You expect me to fight that
behemoth?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Your father would expect you to act like a
man.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest clearing - day</strong>: A large tree trunk spans
a swift-flowing river. The ragged band of woodsmen approach the
makeshift bridge. Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge,
brandishing a long wooden staff.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: This is my bridge. No one crosses without
paying tax.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Just bugger off, mate, huh?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: If you wish to cross, it will cost you a gold
medallion.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Ain’t I hurt you a bloody nuff for one
day?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: If he’s in a hurry to end his mortal
misery, help him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You don’t have the courage to face me again,
John Little? Or should I call you ‘Little John’?</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Alright, m’old cock. You wanna nuther
good wallopin’?</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Lil’ wet behind the ears, mate?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Don’t fool with him. Get him!</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Swimmin’ time again, ol’ chum.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Bloomin’ shame. ’E were a brave
’un.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Help! Cain’t bloody swim.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Do you yield?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Do you yield?</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Good. Now put your feet down.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: I’ll be buggered.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Pay me the tax.</p>
<p><strong>john little</strong>: Robin Hood, ya got balls o’ solid
rock.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sherwood forest - night</strong>: A BONFIRE CRACKLES.
The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a
jug.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Mead. Made it m’self.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: A fine brew, Little John.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Real honey.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: With regrets, I decline.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: An Englishman’s mead not bleedin’ good
enough for ya?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: On the contrary. I thank you, but my faith
prevents me from partaking in such enjoyments.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Your bloody loss, mate.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: What is it, boy? Speak up!</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: I wanna thankee, Lord Locksley. I owes ya
m’life.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am glad I chanced
by in time to help.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: C’mon, lad, drink! ‘Twill put hair on
your bloomin’ chest.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Tell me about your men, John.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: This stumpy one ‘ere’s David o’
Doncaster. We calls ’im Bull.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How do you come by the name, Bull?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: ‘Cuz o’ my size, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Because you are short?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Nay. ’Cuz I be so long.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No, Bull. Save it for the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Your name, friend?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: That be Hal Brownwell, but the lads
call i’m Hal Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Hold! Hal, you have the face and hands of a
farmer. I wager you are a strong and honest man, and I’d be glad to have
you at my side in a fight. The next man who makes light of you will have
to answer to me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How is it there are so many of you in
hiding?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: We’re outlaws. Got prices on our ’eads,
every man jack. Blasted Sheriff says we owes ’im taxes.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How do you fare?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: We get by, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: While the Sheriff steals your land and your
families starve?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: What in bloody blazes’d ya have us
do?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Your ghosts will only keep his men at bay so
long, my friend. Soon the Sheriff will hunt you down and hang you. You
must fight back.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: We show as much as a toe outside the
forest, they’ll slaughter us like bleedin’ sheep.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We must organize. Win by guile.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: ‘We’? Ya lookin’ to join us, matie?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No. To lead you.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Ha! I would never be led by the son of
a Druid.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: There are many here who knew my father to be
a kind and generous man. I doubt that in their hearts they believe him
capable of such a horror.</p>
<p>****: 52.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What is your name, friend?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Count me not a friend, Locksley.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Stuff a flippin’ cork in it, Will. The
man’s our guest.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: That there’s Will Scarlet. Pay ‘im no
’eed. ’E’s full o’ piss and wind.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: He is right to distrust me. I am a rich man’s
son. I have done no honest labor. But today I am as poor as any of you.
Nottingham has stolen all that I own. And when I killed Gisborne’s men,
I, too, became an outlaw.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya’re full o’bloody wind an’ all, mate.
This ‘ere load o’ rubbish agin the Sheriff’s bloomin’ army? Ya must be
bloody jokin’.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We can win. And I believe we will.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya’re a daft bugger, Robin Hood, but
ya’re a brave ‘un, I’ll give ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz tomorrow ya
mayn’t be so lucky! Tomorrow I shall best ya an’ crack that blasted
noble head in two.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - sunrise</strong>: A steady trickle of
RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes,
cursing. All around him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered
with rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess. Robin sits,
brooding.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I have led you wrong. This is no army. These
men live like dogs.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: English dogs. They can learn.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Learn what? To build kennels?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Too much mead, old friend. What day is
it?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Sunday, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Good. Do they still give alms to the poor at
the mass?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: They do. These days the need for mercy is
greater than ever.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Then I must ask you a favor.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city gate - day</strong>: Robin taps his way through the
crowd. Past the piercing stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: My God, you stink!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Pardon my blindness, sir. I’m always falling
down.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yeech! Get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>int. nottingham cathedral - day</strong>: Jesus hangs from
the cross. A magnificent stained glass window. In the ornate pulpit, the
BISHOP OF HEREFORD, bedecked in ermine.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on all your
people, but most especially on our noble Lord Nottingham. Grant him the
wisdom to guide and protect our glorious city.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Grant him also the strength to bring to
justice the lawless men who threaten its safety. Help him to stamp out
the curse of the dread Druids who would seize from us our children, even
as wolves steal the lambs from their mothers.</p>
<p><strong>various</strong>: 1. Alms! 2. Have mercy, milady. 3. Pity,
fine sir. 4. For my baby. 5. Etc.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Alms for a blind man. For one who cannot see
your beauty.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: This is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: So you care for my safety?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: No, for mine. I do not wish to be seen with
an outlaw.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Under the Sheriff’s law, that’s a badge of
pride.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: He’s put a price on your head.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: A hundred gold pieces.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Is that all? I have not annoyed him enough.
Soon he will offer ten thousand.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: For ten thousand I would turn you in myself.
Nottingham is mounting an army.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: He has rounded up every blacksmith in the
county. He has them holed up in the castle making swords and armor.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What is he planning?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I don’t know, but there’s no limit to the
man’s ambitions. Go!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: If you need me, I will be with the woodsmen.
Send for me as ‘Robin Hood.’</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Robin! Do something for me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Care to join me?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: You shine like the sun, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: You have been meeting with young Robin
of Locksley. My cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some
horses.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Yes. A most disagreeable experience.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: I deeply regret it, and I promise you he
will be brought to justice. For subjecting you to such treatment, I will
hang him from the walls with his own entrails.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I would like to see that, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: My dear, a woman of your refinement is
not safe living alone. If you would consent to bring your household
within the city walls, I could give your needs my most personal
attention.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from the
heart, but for now I prefer to stay in my family’s ancestral home. My
cousin, King Richard, will be deeply moved to hear of your concern for
my welfare.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Alas, the King has many enemies both
abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will return.
When he does, he will wish to reward his faithful subjects.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Alms, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: A hundred crowns, Sheriff? You insult me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Remember young Robin of Locksley, Sheriff?
Meet Robin Hood. Your nemesis. Your avenging angel.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: If you kill me, you will hang.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: If I kill you, I will hang happy.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I want to give you a chance. A chance you do
not deserve. A chance to right your wrongs.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: From this day forward you will cease to tax
my people. You will renounce the charges against my father, and you will
return his lands to me.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Because for every harm you do, I swear by God
I shall visit on you threefold in return.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Empty words.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I am here with a blade at your throat. As
long as I live, you will always know that I could be here again.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Your answer?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Never, fool.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Then it will begin..</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Please excuse my clumsiness.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - day</strong>: Men gather around as
Robin dismounts, admiring the horse.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: A personal loan from the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You should not have left without me,
Englishman.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How so? You have not raised a finger to
protect me.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Before I had a choice.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It was my choice to do this alone.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: A foolish risk. If you had been killed, I
would be cursed for eternity for failing to fulfil my pledge.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aslan, if I didn’t know better, I would swear
you were worried about me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nottingham cathedral</strong>: The Sheriff maniacally
spits out orders to Gisborne.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Starve them out. Slaughter their
livestock. I want to see Locksley’s own people fighting each other to
bring him to us.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: I swear he will not live to see the next
full moon.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hamlet - day</strong>: A SQUEALING HOG is loaded onto a
wagon. SOLDIERS round up the livestock. An old FARMER protests.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Go’ bless ya, sir. Leave us the sow. She’s
with young ’uns. The next litter’ll feed us through the winter.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You’ve heard of Robin Hood?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Then pray he is brought to us before
winter.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - day</strong>: A trail of refugees.
Women and children carry their belongings into camp.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Wulf runs to greet his mother and
siblings. A contingent of woodsmen confronts Robin.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: You brought this misery on us,
Locksley. We can barely feed ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Sheriff hasn’t left us a bloody pot to
piss in.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Then we shall take from him and his rich
friends.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Brave talk, Locksley. I say we take
the rich boy in.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Will, do you think the Sheriff will give
everything back after I am gone?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: He will give us the reward, and our
pardons.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Alright, Will. You can take me in on one
condition. You must fight me. You may use the Sheriff’s horse and arm
yourself as you please. I will fight on foot. Unarmed.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Unarmed?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: If you lose, you will accept me as your
leader. If you win, you may take me in. Dead or alive.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Dead, Locksley.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - day</strong>: Hands tighten a girth.
Will confidently jokes with his cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive
circle of spectators. Little John and his wife, Fanny, keep to
themselves, while Wulf openly talks with Robin, Aslan and Duncan. Robin
is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged with scars.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: This man has true purpose. He means to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: And you have given him the means.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: Will is ruthless, Robin. Guard your back.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I am grateful for your concern, friends, but
I have to prove to them it is possible to overcome unequal odds. I am
ready, Will.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Come on, you little piss pot. Do your
worst!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The horse is smarter than you are, Will.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Here, Will! You aim like a girl, Will!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Thank the Lord you are not endowed like
Bull.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Bollocks, Will. Jus’ bugger off,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya got us by the short and curlies,
Robin Hood. Now let’s hear what ya got to bleedin’ say.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Robin scans the faces. He has their
attention.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Nottingham has taken from us everything we
own. Now we are going to start taking from him.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: ’Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna do
that?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We are going to tax him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest road - day</strong>: Autumn. The forest is a
mosaic of green, gold, orange, and red. A giant eye in a circle of
glass. Aslan, his telescope raised.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Two wagons. Twenty escort.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Twenty? They usually have five.</p>
<p><strong>scope pov</strong>: A phalanx of mounted soldiers, a cart
loaded with barrels, and a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on
wheels, with crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne commands the
escort.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: This is no ordinary convoy.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: ’ow many?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Er, about ten. Why scare them? They can’t
count anyway.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: And they call me the barbarian.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>back on roadway</strong>: Robin and Aslan swing down from the
trees onto the tax wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are unable to fire
at them. Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his head and drops
unconscious. John whips the horse, driving the cart after Robin. Another
camouflage screen is lifted into place, covering their route.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Gisborne races back to the road… the
wagons are gone. He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and
cursing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest clearing - day</strong>: Robin climbs onto the
tax wagon’s roof. Angry shouts from inside.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Surrender your weapons. I give you my word
you shall go free.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ah, I feared as much.</p>
<p><strong>countryside</strong>: Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of
a strongbox. The lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in
astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with glittering gold
coins. The woodsmen press around. Cheers of celebration.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: I’ll be buggered.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: This treasure had a purpose. We must find out
what.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Get off him. He’s a man of the cloth.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: The Lord’s blessing on you, kind sir. These
sinners were attempting to steal these libations destined for the monks
of St. Catherine’s.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It appears to me, Reverend Friar, that many
of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: A thousand pardons, sir, but duty beckons. I
must hasten on.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: A moment, my reverend friend. You travel with
poor company when you travel with Nottingham’s soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Aye, tax him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: My men are thirsty and have much to
celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Lord bless me, sir, are these your men? I had
mistook them for common thieves. Kindly step aside.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Surely the Lord has the charity to spare a
few barrels to good Christian men.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Well, sir, if you wish them to share in the
good Lord’s brew…</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: … you must best me for it.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Giddyup, nag!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You leave when I say.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Protect me, Lord.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Yield!</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Confess that Friar Tuck is a better, holier,
and braver man than thou art, knave.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Never! Whoomf!</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Yield, I say! Yield to Friar Tuck.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yield yourself!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yield to Robin Hood.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Thank you, Lord, for teaching me
humility.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Well, Friar Tuck. We have need of an honest
man of God, to minister to these men and their families. What do you
say?</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: I’d rather roast in hell.</p>
<p><strong>friar tuck</strong>: strapped into the traces, pulls the beer
cart. Sweating profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly
follows.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Giddyup, Friar.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What do you say now, Tuck? Here are the meek
of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: The Lord moves in mysterious ways. I
accept.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You will not regret it.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Aye, but you may.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp</strong>: A blazing fire. Deer carcasses
roast. Tuck’s barrels supply the refreshment. Robin and Aslan pass out
coins to each family.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Buy yourself a new son, Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Thankee, Robin.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Cain’t get a bleedin’ squeak outa ’em,
Rob.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: They’d be spittin’ it out good if they’d
knowed anythin’.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Reckon the Cap’n knows summat, Rob, but
stubborn ol’ cocker ’e is.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Perhaps it is time for some heathen
persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>captain of soldiers</strong>: stares up at Robin
defiantly.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Spare your breath. I know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I believe you. But this Arab here, he’s got
it into his barbarian brain that you know a whole lot more than
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: And when he gets like this, he’s very hard to
reason with.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I strongly advise you to talk. He hasn’t
eaten in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: For Godsakes, get him off me!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No, Aslan… not this one, Aslan. … How about
this other one?… Fatter, yes… more meat.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin’
men.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I cannot stop him, John. Besides, if they
will not tell what they know, then they must pay the price.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Kill ’em aye, but not like this.
’Tain’t Christian.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The demented Arab slowly reappears.
Blood drips from his lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the
end of which is the soldier’s glove… the man’s arm. Turning to Robin,
Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates wildly at the Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What does he say?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Well, roughly, he says that he doesn’t care
for the way your friend tastes, and he wants you.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: No, God, no! I’ll talk. Just keep him away.
Keep him away!</p>
<p><strong>behind wagon</strong>: Bull holds the other prisoner,
muffling the man’s mouth and trying to suppress his own laughter. Beside
them lies a large chunk of venison. The man is unharmed, except that
he’s missing a glove.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodsman’s hut - night</strong>: The walls shake with
Little John’s laughter.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Sure changed the color of ’is britches,
didn’t ’e?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Thanks to our cannibal friend.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Why’d the Sheriff be sendin’ gold north o’ the
border?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: To hire mercenaries. The Celts are savage
tribesmen, trained to kill from birth.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Aye, the Romans built a bleedin’ great
wall to keep ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: What does ’e want wi ’em?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Since he also has every Smith in the country
working in his castle, we can assume he is planning a little war.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Agin’ who?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: England.</p>
<p><strong>int. castle armory - night</strong>: Sparks. Smoke. Sweat.
The Sheriff inspects his weapon factory. His eyes glint with the
reflections of the smithy’s fires. A DOOR CRASHES open behind him.
FOOTSTEPS. Paying no heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It’s blade
white- hot.</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: We were ambushed. In Sherwood Forest.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Spanish steel, cousin. So much stronger
than our native blades. Any losses?</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: All the men are gone.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Yet again you are the sole survivor,
cousin? Interesting. And the gold?</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: Well, it er… disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the
first time.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Robin Hood?</p>
<p><strong>gisborne</strong>: They were woodsmen, dressed in green.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Robin Hood.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Cousin, we must be strong. We cannot
allow this outlaw to make fools of us.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: And I cannot allow a lieutenant to fail
me. It is indeed fine steel.</p>
<p><strong>ext. village - day</strong>: A small procession. Tuck drives
his cart, Bull the tax wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf
and Hal pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the villagers.
Their weapons are prominently displayed. Tuck swigs from a jar, passes
it to an old villager.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: God bless you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>villager</strong>: An’ Go’ bless Robin ‘Ood, friar. They says
as ’ow none o’ the Sheriff’s cronies dare go within miles o’ Sherwood
for fear o’ havin’ their pockets pinched.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Ah, the good Lord giveth and the good Lord
taketh away.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Unless Robin Hood takes it first!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Laughter. The procession passes two of
the Sheriff’s mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his jug
in greeting.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Good morrow, brothers.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest pool - day</strong>: Water, sparkling with
sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives in naked. He luxuriates in the cool
water… HOOFBEATS. He attempts to hide… too late. Four horses emerge from
the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant Sarah sandwiched
between them. Bull has a black eye. Marian jumps down.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: How dare you!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Good morning, Lady Marian.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You send men to drag me from my home in the
middle of the night, like some slave girl? Is this the way the famous
Robin Hood treats a lady?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ah well… er, let me finish this bath you
wished me to take. Then I’ll explain.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I demand an explanation right now!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: If you will be patient, I could spare your
propriety by…</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I will decide when my propriety is
compromised.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He wades bare-ass naked out of the water
towards her. She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body,
glistening with water.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: How dare you expose yourself to me?!</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: The big ’un did the same to me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - day</strong>: An arrow flies into a
bull’s-eye, crudely marked on a tree. Little John lowers his crossbow,
delighted at his shot.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Right m’lad. Let’s see how close you
can git to that bugger.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Take a gander at this ‘un, mates. Never
seen nuthin’ like it in my bloomin’ life.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: This better be damned important.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Nottingham robs the poor. We rob Nottingham
and give back to the poor.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Do you think he’s going to let you get away
with all this? The man is without mercy. He will annihilate you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Somebody has to take a stand.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You’re taking a stand with the lives of
these people. These young ones.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Nottingham was sending this gold to buy
reinforcements from the Celtic tribesmen. We need to warn King
Richard.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Nottingham would not dare challenge the
King.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The King is not in England to be challenged,
is he? While he is away, he may lose his country. You are Richard’s
cousin. You can get word to him. He would believe you.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Now you want me to participate in your
folly?</p>
<p><strong>bouquet</strong>: protrudes from Marian’s saddle. She is
mounted, ready to go. Sarah giggles as she takes her leave of Bull.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I am sending Duncan with you. Give him some
warm food and a real bed. I grow tired of his bellyaching.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Hah! I have endured more hardship in my
lifetime than any man here.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Don’t tell him I told you, but he may be
useful to you. There is no one to whom I would rather entrust your
safety.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Duncan, you are most welcome.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Will you send word to the King?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>int. dubois mansion - day</strong>: A globule of red liquid.
A signet ring. Marian seals a letter.</p>
<p><strong>int. bishop’s castle - day</strong>: The letter is held in
the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the Bishop of Hereford. A lavish
office.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: It is a personal matter, my Lord, but one of
vital importance.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I understand, my dear lady. This is my most
trusted emissary.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You will travel to France immediately. You
must give this directly into the hands of the King, and him alone.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: My lady-in-waiting will accompany you.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: My dear, I could not vouch for her safety.
The journey is fraught with danger.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I appreciate your concern, my Lord, but
Sarah is an accomplished rider. I must insist that she goes along.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - day</strong>: An informal council of
war. Robin uses a stick in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We have to be ready to move camp at any time.
The only way we can be attacked is from the Nottingham Road. We hide
lookouts in the trees, here and here. If they see soldiers, they shoot
warning arrows. Whistles by day, fire by night.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: Father! Come quick. Mother’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodsmen’s hut - day</strong>: Fanny Little writhes in
agony. John rushes in. Tuck looks up from Fanny’s side.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: The child comes early.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Hush, m’lass. Ya’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: ’S not like t’others, John. Oh God, it pains
me so.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya’re sittin’ thar like a fat sow. Help
her, man, help her!</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: I am doing all I can.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: By Allah, leeches!</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Get away from her!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Blood is like air. If she loses blood, she
and the child will die.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: He lies. He is the devil’s seed, sent to lead
us astray.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Fool, both the Bible and the Koran instruct
us to preserve life.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Your baby has not turned. It cannot be born
without help.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: What do you know, you damned savage?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: If you will allow me, I can help her. It will
not be without danger.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Do not listen to him! He will kill her.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: If you do not listen to me, she will
certainly die. And the child, too.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The good Friar has done all he can. I suggest
you let the Arab try. If I am wrong, and they die, then you may take my
life.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: So be it.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Then it will be on your head. I have warned
you.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Bring me a needle, thread, water, a skinning
knife, and burning ashes.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: The child must be taken out by the knife.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The knife?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I have seen it many times with horses.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Horses? By the Lord, what are her
chances?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: After wasting so much blood… not good.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Now you tell me!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Are you ready?… Bite down on this… Robin,
hold her steady.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: I tell you, the barbarian is killing her.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: The mother heaves, then drops.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Is she gone?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Aslan ignores him, keeps working over
Fanny’s body. Robin cannot watch… a WAIL! Aslan mutters something in
awed Arabic.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: It is a boy.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Your son, my lady… Robin, hold her skin
together while I sew her up.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: marches among the cheering families,
holding his newborn child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to
one side. Bloody and exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut door. Tuck
jumps to his feet, drawing his knife. Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin
appears, unsteadily, behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck
stares at Aslan. Raises his blade… and slices down across his own
wrist.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: This day God has taught me a fine lesson.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: I would be honored.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: You are a good man, my barbarian friend.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: We shall open a barrel together and I shall
do my damndest to save your heathen soul.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Alas, I am not permitted…</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Our God made this brew, brother. I merely
combined the ingredients. Do you dare to insult his works?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>courier</strong>: My horse seems to be favoring a
foreleg.</p>
<p><strong>int. dubois mansion - marian’s chamber - night</strong>:
Flickering candlelight. Marian is alone, reading. A sudden gust
extinguishes her candle. HAMMERING and SHOUTING from a distant part of
the house. Unnerved, she calls out.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Who is there? Duncan!</p>
<p><strong>int. dubois mansion - kitchen - night</strong>: Marian enters
stealthily. A candle in one hand, a drawn dagger in the other. Something
leaps at her!… A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She shoos
him down.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: We meet again.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Drop your blade.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You are still overmatched, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You owe me favors, wench. Bare your
breasts… or I will do it for you.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I am sorry, my lady. There were too
many.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Is there something you need, gentlemen? I
remember no masked ball on my calendar.</p>
<p><strong>aerial shot</strong>: FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an
expanse of green, intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING
AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in…</p>
<p><strong>int. castle chamber - night</strong>: The Sheriff and SIX
BARONS are gathered around the model. These are the men who revealed
their faces to Lord Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with
a white rat on his arm.</p>
<p><strong>redhead baron</strong>: Forget about Locksley. He is no
threat.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: How can we control all England if we
cannot control our own county? The people are turning him into a
hero.</p>
<p><strong>greybeard baron</strong>: It is impossible to attack him in
the forest. We have tried everything. He is cunning.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Then we will be more cunning. I must be
rid of him. We may not be able to intercept his next warning to the
King.</p>
<p><strong>celtic chieftain</strong>: I want the heads of the men who
stole my gold.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Welcome, sir. We were discussing how to
rid ourselves of those very men. The outlaws who band with Robin
Hood.</p>
<p><strong>redhead baron</strong>: My Lord Nottingham, I must protest.
It is a mistake to ally ourselves with foreigners.</p>
<p><strong>greybeard baron</strong>: What can these Celts do that we
cannot?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Chieftain strides across to the
fire. Grabs a burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log spits
sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head… and drives it into his
own palm. He stares unblinking at the Baron, holding the log to his hand
for a full three seconds. An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted
with the demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: This rat Hood has hidden out in the
forest. He resists all our assaults with traps and devices, while he
robs us blind. We must bring him out and destroy him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - night</strong>: The campfire. Aslan
shrieks a war cry. Dervishes ’round the fire, swigging from a jug.
Equally drunk, the Friar follows, howling, mimicking him. Robin and the
others watch in amusement. Tuck scoops another jug and hands it to
Aslan.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Come, you son of Saladin. A toast to all of
Jehovah’s children. The saved and the damned.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: This must be a truly evil potion, to make the
soul feel this good.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Come, holy man. A toast to all of Allah’s
children. The true believers and the fat infidels.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: How can these Arabs hold Jerusalem when they
can’t even hold their brew?</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest lane - dawn</strong>: A masked soldier gallops
along. Hurls a bundle to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The dancing demon! Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: If it was Jehovah who created this brew, he
is truly wise. He built the punishment into the crime.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They need help.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest lane - day</strong>: Bull and Hal are crouched in
the roadway, over a body. Robin runs up with Aslan. He kneels beside
them. The body is Duncan. Robin clasps a dead hand… Silence. Fighting
his emotions.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: A bloke wearin’ a mask o’ the Druids rode by.
Tossed ’im down.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Are you sure it was a Druid mask? Damn them
to hell! They must have Marian. Do you know where they meet?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: The Gregor Caves, I ’eard tell.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: We will go there.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No! You stay here, dammit! I will go
alone.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You forget yourself. I am not your
servant.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Then be my friend. There are women and
children here in greater need of your courage.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Take my eyes, then.</p>
<p><strong>ext. caves</strong>: SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from
the trees. Robin rides up the path to the caves that his father took.
Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves cautiously
forward.</p>
<p><strong>pov through scope - circle of stones</strong>: No one
visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes. Remnants of a recent
ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Robin climbs silently down the rocks
into the stone circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar. Through
the opening of the cave, he spies a woman’s form, lying face down.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Marian!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He runs forward. Turns the body over.
Skin chalk-white from loss of blood… Sarah! A shadow falls across Robin.
Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into blackness.</p>
<p><strong>int. cave - day</strong>: Robin’s eyes – he wakes. Squints
around him, the dark smoke-filled recesses of the caves. The walls
weave. Eerie WATERY sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men. He tries to
stand.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Robin!… Robin!</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Death is not to be feared, Robin. Embrace
it.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Drink this.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Drink.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Look at me. Listen to me. You belong to me.
Your soul is mine. You will obey my every word. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Why, Marian?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Because you love me. Say it. You love me.
Say it!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Where is Marian?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: She is with friends. Your resistence is
strong, but useless. Sign this. You are a Druid like your father. You
consort with the devil. Your confession will be witnessed by the Bishop
of Hereford.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: The painted man!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Bull joins the fray, charging like his
namesake, howling in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf
stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy. A furious
melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like hay, battling far superior
odds. Soon they are the only two left standing. Bull peers cautiously
into the dark- ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
feet… and lunges.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Marian?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian burial.
Promise me, boy.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>ext. gregor caves - day</strong>: Aslan carries Robin
outside. Robin is staggering, glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His
arm blocks the light from his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: They have poisoned you. There are herbs that
can alter a man’s brain. I know of only one cure.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: It worked for me this very morning. You will
thank me for this later.</p>
<p><strong>ext. country lane - day</strong>: Distant THUNDER. Three
horses. First Wulf’s, leading another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah
draped across its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up in
front of him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You have fulfilled your vow. Now you can
leave.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Your gratitude warms my heart.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You ignored my request.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: It is fortunate that I did.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Because of you, another good man is dead.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: He urged me to bring him. He was a brave man
and I grieve for him. Praise be to Allah that I do not grieve for you
also. Or for my broken vow.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: To hell with your damn vow.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I am glad you are feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The forest! Ride!</p>
<p><strong>ext. sherwood forest - day</strong>: Fire. Blazing rampant.
Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire arrows. At a
shouted order, another wave of flaming arrows ignites the trees. Behind
the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback. One is the Sheriff, in
full armor. The other is the black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as
still as a rock.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodsmen’s camp - day</strong>: Chaos. Acrid black smoke
pours across the clearing. Disarray. COUGHING, SCREAMING, confusion.
Little John vainly attempts to instill calm.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya’ll be jus’ fine. Lil’ smoke ain’t
gonna kill ya.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: It’s burning for miles, John. It’s
hotter than hades, and them damn screens ain’t worth nothing.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: ’Ere, lads… Over ’ere! We must make a
stand.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Damn y’all! Ya’re no more use than a
load o’ wet farts.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Where’s that damn Locksley? I’ll swear
he betrayed us.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody
bellyachin’.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: C… cccc…</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: C… ccc? What the bloody hell ya sayin’?
Cows?… Cowards?…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Cccc… elts!</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Celts? Where?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Gggg… God help us.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hillside - day</strong>: Celts, arrayed behind their
Chieftain. An awesome sight. Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and
faces, head- pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie
silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up to the
Chieftain.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: I want prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>chieftain</strong>: We came to fight.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Nevertheless, I need prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sherwood forest - day</strong>: The bloodcurdling cry
fills the sky. Amidst the smoke and chaos, Little John’s small band is
gathered at the edge of the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: What are we gonna do, John?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Stop ‘ere and flippin’ well fight ’em,
that’s what. Whadya say, lads?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Nay, reveren’. Ya best be goin’ wi’ the
wenches.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: This holy man believes in doing God’s work
with his hands.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Let’s give ‘em a bloody good wallopin’
an’ all, lads.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest road - day</strong>: Aslan reins in. In the
valley below, the forest is ablaze. The Sheriff’s armed hordes swarm
over the em- battled woodsmen.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Wulf, stay here. I need your horse.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What are you doing? Out of my way!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I saved your life. I will not let you give it
away for no purpose.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Out of my way, damn you!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Does the witch still have possession of your
senses? If we meet up with the survivors we may yet give them some help.
And do some damage to the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Robin debates. Relents. They urge their
horses into a gallop.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sherwood forest - day</strong>: The Sheriff’s men stomp
through the burning forest. From the other side of the flaming trees,
Little John’s men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat, turn
and fire again. They back into a clearing… The Celtic mercenaries charge
at them across the open ground. The woodsmen drop their bows.
Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are being decimated.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Surely you would not harm a man of the
cloth?</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: You would? Then to hellfire with you.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: ‘Bout bleedin’ time, mush.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Thank you, Lord. And thank you, Allah.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Aslan is a wild man. Steering his horse
with just legs and knees, he strikes out with both swords to left and
right. The momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the edge of the
clearing. Starts picking off stragglers. His father spots him.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Git the bleedin’ ’ell outa there, ya
li’l bugger.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Don’t ‘ee start bleedin’ blubberin’, or
ya’ll make me bloody vomit.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: It was a fiendish mind that planned this
campaign.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sherwood forest - dusk</strong>: A shovel breaks dirt.
Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a grave. The clearing is transformed into
a cemetery. Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags a
Celt’s corpse into a grave. Throws the man’s armor and weapons into a
growing pile.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You were an honor to your countrymen today,
Aslan. You fought better than twenty English knights.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: This war is the God of Abraham against the
forces of evil.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Well, the war is over.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: There is too much blood on my hands.</p>
<p><strong>int. castle dungeons - night</strong>: A heavy key turns in a
lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol- lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the
torture chamber where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them Wulf
and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the floor, walls encrusted
with dried blood and grime. Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry
smile.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Would you prefer pain or death?</p>
<p><strong>first woodsman</strong>: Death.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Torture him.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: And you? Pain or death?</p>
<p><strong>second woodsman</strong>: … Er… pain.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Torture him… you see, it makes no
difference.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: You will all be tortured. You will all
tell me all you know about Robin Hood, and then you will all be hanged.
Then we will catch your beloved Robin Hood and do the same to him.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I will kill him for you.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: Will, no!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Why would I need you?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: All your attempts to kill him have
failed. Your army failed. Your Celtic mercenaries failed.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: And you can succeed?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I am one of his men. He would never
suspect me.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: He knows you always hated him, traitor.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: He is a trusting fool. He will believe
me. If he doesn’t, he will kill me and you have lost nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: If you fail, I will personally cut out
your lying tongue.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: And if I succeed?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: His friends will.. … torture him!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: It will look better.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sherwood forest - night</strong>: A winter’s night.
Bitterly cold. Sad figures huddled around a small fire. Fanny tends to
John’s wounds, their little ones asleep by their feet. John drinks and
passes the jug to Tuck, who numbly shakes his head. Too depressed even
to drink. Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who sits
alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: My pride brought us to this.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: No, friend. It was you who gave these men
pride.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I gave them nothing but false hope. Tomorrow
we will disperse. These people can move south and start over. You must
go home and win your Jasmina.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I am no longer your responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: That is for me to decide.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Damn you, Arab. I want you out of my life.
Can’t you understand that? Go home. Go back to your own kind.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Damn you, too, Father. You reared a coward
and a fool.</p>
<p><strong>november moon</strong>: Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the
medallion, dangling in its center… the last thing Robin sees before his
eyes close into troubled sleep. The white moon against the black
sky…</p>
<p><strong>its negative image</strong>: – a black circle against a white
sky. An executioner. The round medallion has become a noose. In the
noose appears Wulf’s face. The executioner hauls on the rope and Wulf’s
features contort in the agony of death. Another noose, another face…
Duncan. Another – Bull. Another – Marian.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Kiss me, Robin.</p>
<p><strong>locksley</strong>: Why have you betrayed me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>robin’s face</strong>: DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER
BECOMES the sound of a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive
away the horror.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The first streaks of light fight their
way through a thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure, at
first indecipherable. Aware of his presence, Robin looks up.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Will! I thought you were taken.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How did you escape?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I promised to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: And will you?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: I’ll wring yer scrawny neck, Will
Scarlet. I’d be doin’ yer a bloody favor an’ all.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Afore ya kill ’im, John, ask ’im if Wulf be
still alive.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Y… e…</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Git us a rope, Hal, and we’ll put the
bleedin’ weasel outa ’is misery.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: John, wait. Let us hear what he has to
say.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: No bugger ‘scapes the Sheriff, ’nless
’e’s linin’ ‘is bloomin’ pockets.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: A traitor sneaks in and out under cover of
darkness. Will walked in and announced himself.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Aye. ‘E always did ’ave balls o’
brass.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Let’s sss… string ’im up.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Let him speak.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Search ’im, Hal. ’E’ll ’ave a bloody
blade on ’im somewheres.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Bugger me.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I bring a message from Nottingham. Our
men are to be hung in the square on Saturday. At high noon.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: What about my boy?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: The boy, too. Ten men in all.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Their deaths are a warning. Anyone who
associates with the outlaw Hood is to suffer the same fate. Man, woman,
or child. Even anyone who so much as utters his name.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Robin Hood! May as
well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: The hangings are to be part of the
celebration for the Sheriff’s marriage.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Marriage, eh? What lucky wench gits to
play with the Sheriff’s codpiece?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Lady Marian.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: He takes a bride of royal blood?</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Aye, and then with King Richard gone,
he takes the bloody throne.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You were to use this news to get close to me,
and then kill me? Right, Will?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Not straightway, of course.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What is your intention, Will?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: That depends on you, Locksley.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I’ve never trusted you, that’s no
secret. What I wanna know is, are you gonna finish what you started?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Robin is on the spot. All eyes on him.
Will presses his point.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Will ya stay and keep us fightin’ till
every man jack of us is dead? Or will you run like the spoiled little
rich boy I always took you for?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You present quite a choice. What would you
have me do, Will?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: If you run, I will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: And if I stay, will you all stay with me?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: To the end, friend.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: If my heathen brother stays, I stay.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Mmmm… meee… tttt…</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: ’E’s in. We’re all bloody in. Daft
buggers.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: There’s your answer, Will. We finish it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nottingham town square - dusk</strong>: Ten gallows,
silhouetted against the setting sun. The black-armored Celt tests a
gallows, springing the hatch. A heavy sack dangles from the rope.
Grim-faced peasants watch. Among them – Fanny Little.</p>
<p><strong>int. dungeon - dusk</strong>: The sound of the gallows ECHOES
inside the damp, stone walls. Wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to
rings in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light high in the
wall. The purple sky is turning black. He fingers his wooden
crucifix.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: If it be your biddin’ that this be my last
night o’ life, Lord, gimme the pluck to die proud. An’ look ‘ee kindly
on my folks an’ the young ’uns.</p>
<p><strong>branches</strong>: Sunlight glistens on frost-laden branches.
A COCK ROBIN</p>
<p><strong>ext. sherwood forest - dawn</strong>: In the troubled human
realm, Tuck says his morning prayer.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Lord, grant us the courage to endure, and if
you’re as smart as I believe you are, grant us victory… and the victuals
to celebrate it with.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Will you pray with me, son of Allah?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I have prayed for you, often, my brother.
But, let us put prayer aside and help our gods in a more practical
manner. I must reveal to you the mysteries of the black powder.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Will it work?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You are truly a wizard.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: There is no such thing. But if there was… … I
would surely be one.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We have no armored knights, no glorious
banners. But I am honored to be going to battle in this company. Today
we fight not just for the lives of our friends, but to save all
England.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We may be only six men, but…</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Seven!</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: What in blazes ya doin’, woman? Where’s
the little ’uns?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Them’s safe, wi’ my mother. Robin, I been to
town an’ seen the scaffold and the guard towers.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya gone bleedin’ cracked, girl?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: You go an’ birth eight babies and then you
can come an’ tell me ‘bout hurtin’, ya big ox. I ain’t gonna sit aroun’
an’ let one o’ ’em die, neither.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya should be bloody well mindin’ the
other seven. Tell ’er, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Fanny, show me the exact location of the
scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nottingham - day</strong>: The gallows. Swathed in a
pink glow. A brilliant, wintry morning. Breath billows from the mouths
of the sentries.</p>
<p><strong>int. nottingham castle - corridor - day</strong>: Boots clack
confidently down a stone corridor. The Sheriff decked in wedding finery.
He enters…</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: How is my bride?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Ah… You are overwhelmed with
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I will never marry you.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Hold her!</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Get away from me, you disgusting hag. I will
not… augh!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: When we are married, thirty of the
northern barons will pledge me their support as king. As you
predicted.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: What do you see in the portents?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: The union. The blood of the lion and the
house of Nottingham. New faith. New power. New souls.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: If there is no union, there will be
darkness, despair, death. Ours!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Di not give me riddles, woman. We are to
be married within hours. How can we be in danger?</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: The blood does not lie.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Tell me how it will result.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: I have told you what I know.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Confound you, crone. Without my
protection, the people would hunt you down, rip out your black heart and
burn it.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Without me, you are nothing. You are
straw, a fleabite, a speck. Laugh, fool. I birthed you from this body. I
stole a babe in this very castle, and killed it so that you might rise
in its place. You are my son. Together we are strong. Now is not the
time to doubt. Now is the time to believe, to be bold. The bold will
prevail.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city gate - day</strong>: Masses stream in. They give
wide berth to a Celtic war- rior in a boar’s head helmet. Soldiers prod
and harness the passing peasants. Tuck drives a cartload of barrels. A
GUARD stops him.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What you got there, Father?</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: The Lord’s finest brew for the good
Nottingham’s fighting men. It has a mighty kick.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’ll warrant. Pass.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dungeon gate - day</strong>: Wulf blinks at the sunlight
as the prisoners are led out. Holds his head high. Soldiers hurl abuse,
the people are too cowed to show support. Fanny glances at her son,
crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed. On horseback,
encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his baron cronies watch the outlaws
progress with cruel amusement. A yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being
shoved back by guards.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have word
for you! Of Robin Hood!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I found his lair, but alas he still
lives.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Stretch his neck with the others.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: …He… He… is here!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Locksley, here? Where ?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Call off your dogs.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Release him!… Now, where is he?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: I want your word, in front of these
witnesses. If I tell you, I will go free.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: We will find him.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: He is concealed. He is going to free
the prisoners and stop the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Put Hood in my hands, you go free.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: With the reward. Ten thousand
crowns.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Damn your worthless hide! Just tell me
where he is.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: The reward!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: You’ll get your reward. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>ext. scaffold</strong>: Tuck urges his ancient nag towards
the scaffold with his cargo of barrels. The crowd parts unwillingly.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Out of the way. Make way for the Lord’s
business.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Across the square, Will points urgently
in Tuck’s direction.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city wall - day</strong>: A massive oak stands near the
southern wall. A large figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little
John. He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall itself. He
slips frequently.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city square - day</strong>: The prisoners are led to the
scaffold, where the hooded executioner waits, along with the Chieftain.
Wulf staggers, from his beating. Nottingham’s men encircle Tuck’s cart.
He watches them nervously.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city parapet - day</strong>: Fanny lowers a knotted rope
over the battlement. Far below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him
it’s sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn’t reach his fingertips. He
stretches, loses balance. Falls… desperately grabbing at the rope. He
swings, clinging by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city square - day</strong>: Will leads the Sheriff to
Tuck’s cart.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Step down, friar.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: As you wish, sire. Is there something
amiss?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: This man claims you have outlaws
concealed in these barrels. Among them the cursed Robin Hood.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: This man will rot in hell as a knave and a
liar. These are libations for the celebration of your lordship’s
nuptials.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Break one open!</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Why waste fine vintage, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Try another. There are many barrels,
only a few outlaws.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city parapet - day</strong>: John strains, heaving his
giant frame up the rope. He nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches.
Fanny blocks the man’s view.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: What is your business, woman?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Ain’t doin’ no ‘arm, m’dear. Likes a good
’angin’, I do. Luvly view up ’ere, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ext. city square - day</strong>: Wulf crosses himself as the
executioner steers him to the noose. A hush falls… except for a rotund
old woman who is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head
bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree- branch
crutch.</p>
<p><strong>wounded soldier</strong>: Give room for a fightin’ man and
his ma. Step aside, or I’ll make ya. I wanna see the bastards walk on
air.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city parapet - day</strong>: John struggles over the
battlement. Collapses.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: ’Bout time, ya gurt lug.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: We be too late.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city square - day</strong>: The scaffold is impregnable.
Celts and their Chieftain guard the platform itself. The Sherriff’s men
surround the base. The executioner encircles Wulf’s neck with the noose.
SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the barrels. A hand
tightens the noose… Another grasps an arrow. The executioner’s eyes
glint through the slits. Nottingham intently watches Wulf. The Chieftain
stands, impassive. Fingers close on a bowstring… the fuse-cord burns.
Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge. His eyes close. An arrow flies…
slices through the executioner’s eye slit. The executioner falls. Little
John celebrates… but the Chieftain leaps forward… releases the trap.
Wulf’s body plunges. The rope snaps tight. Little John yells. Fanny
screams. A figure leaps onto the platform… the wounded soldier throws
aside his crutch… Robin! Wulf dangles, strangling. His hands wrench at
the choking cord.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The burning fuse-cord reaches the
barrel. Tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff…
Spotting it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort
to escape. The Chieftain smites at Robin… his blow is blocked… by the
Celt with the boar’s head. KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel
EXPLODES. Spewing smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass
confusion. Amidst the smoke… Robin’s sword slashes through Wulf’s rope.
He hauls him onto the platform.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Here… By God… Let’s fight ’em!</p>
<p><strong>woodsman</strong>: Hal! What happened to your stutter?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It’s gg… ggg… g..oh crap!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Take that, ya mug.</p>
<p><strong>chieftain</strong>: Impostor! You dishonor the clan.</p>
<p><strong>from parapet</strong>: John and Fanny peer down as the smoke
clears. They watch Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Fight fair…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He aims. Grits his teeth… picks off the
Celt with a shaft.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: …Or don’t fight at all.</p>
<p><strong>on scene</strong>: Robin leaps and swings from gallows to
gallows, kicking out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the
trap hole. Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight with
Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and mounted, flails at
Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and around the horse’s legs. Aslan and the
Chieftain are locked in mortal combat. Aslan stumbles back and falls.
The Chieftain swipes at his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes
wood. Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL… It</p>
<p><strong>explodes.</strong>: The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and
Fanny on the parapet.</p>
<p><strong>greybeard baron</strong>: Up there! No mercy, shoot them!</p>
<p><strong>on scene</strong>: Aslan evades the charging Chieftain.
Drop-kicks a soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the Chieftain.
His blows have no effect on the Scot’s black armor. The Sheriff rears
his horse… hooves flail.. knocking Will to his knees. The Sheriff
lunges… Desperate, Will grasps the sword, ignoring the pain… a tug of
war. Blood pours from Will’s hands, where the blade cuts in. He suddenly
lets go… Nottingham topples from his horse. Will leaps on him.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: Pain or death, you butcher?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Here’s another message to Robin Hood,
written in your blood.</p>
<p><strong>will scarlet</strong>: It’s over, fool. You can kill my body,
but you cannot kill our spirit.</p>
<p><strong>redhead baron</strong>: It’s Hood! Get him!</p>
<p><strong>chieftain</strong>: I am iron. I am rock. I am your
death.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You talk too much!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Englishmen! I am not one of you, yet I fight
for you. Against a tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin Hood.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Nottingham runs through the castle gate.
Angry peasants pursue.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Lower the portcullis! Now!</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Too slow, fool!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Friends! We must raise the gate.</p>
<p><strong>ext. castle parapet - day</strong>: Crossbow bolts fly.
Little John ducks and weaves, while spinning and firing at the men
advancing at him from both sides.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Come on, ya ckicken-‘earted buggers. Ya
milksops, ya bleedin’ pansies.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Excuse me, m ’old cock. Ya mind if I
borrow this?</p>
<p><strong>ext. castle gate - day</strong>: Robin and the others try in
vain to lift the portcullis.</p>
<p><strong>int. castle - main corridor - day</strong>: The Sheriff
marches through, issuing orders.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Seal the entrance. Guard it with your
lives. … Bring the bishop to my chapel.</p>
<p><strong>int. castle chamber - day</strong>: Surrounded by flickering
candles, Marian sits before a mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes
faraway, lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs the
bride’s hair with her taloned fingers. The Sheriff’s face appears in the
reflection.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Come! It is time for the union.</p>
<p><strong>int. castle chapel - day</strong>: Once, Christian, now
blasphemously transformed to the practice of black magic. The crucifix
on the altar is upside down. Marian stands before it, between the
Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged in. Frightened. The BATTLE
SOUNDS ECHO.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: They are rebelling. We must escape.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Marry us. When I am declared king, that
rabble will not dare go against us.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Is is madness to delay.</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Face them, or face me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. castle gate - day</strong>: Robin leaps onto Tuck’s
cart.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Light all the barrels, Tuck.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Robin snaps the reins, steering the
rumbling cart across the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights
barrels. FUSES smoke and CRACKLE.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Jump!</p>
<p><strong>int. castle kitchens - day</strong>: Fanny is chased into the
kitchens by a vengeful soldier. He grabs her and pushes her into the
open cooking fire. Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the
head. The servants stare in shock… A chef comes at Fanny with a
knife.</p>
<p><strong>ext. castle forecourt - day</strong>: Hal and the others
battle against huge odds. More peasants join them, daring to take on the
Sheriff’s hated men. Aslan’s a whirlwind, striking out in all
directions. Each blow for a cause.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: For Allah!… For Jehovah! For brotherhood!…
For justice!</p>
<p><strong>int. castle hallways - day</strong>: A door SLAMS back. Robin
bursts through. Alone, against three attackers. He swings a soldier
around. Holds him as a shield, using the man’s own sword against his
companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is off and running.
Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants converge to block
his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings statues. Up the stairs… topples a
suit of armor down on his pursuers.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Where is she? Where is Lady Marian?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up
the corridor, sees six men guarding the private chapel’s arched door-
way.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ah! There is my answer.</p>
<p><strong>int. dungeons - day</strong>: Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck
runs down the dark passage- ways. Before him, an awesome sight… dozens
of pitiful men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer. A
cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: My son, there is a holy war being waged
outside. Release all these wretches and God shall surely find you a
place in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: I’d rather go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>int. castle chapel - day</strong>: Sweating, fearful, the
Bishop rushes through the service.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …your bodies to be bound in immortal
wedlock. Do you, Marian Dubois, take…</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Marian, run! It’s me, Robin. Run!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I warned you, I would find you no matter
what.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: No companions? No army? You rush to your
death for the sake of a woman. Lust has turned you into a fool…
Recognize this, Locksley?</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: Appropriate I should use it to kill you
with, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>int. dungeons - day</strong>: Tuck picks himself up from the
floor. The jailer is amazed.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: The Lord helps those who help themselves.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Give my regards to the devil.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parapet - day</strong>: John is in deep trouble, but
undaunted.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Ya gutless bloody sissies.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Wulf! I told ya to keep outa the
fightin’.</p>
<p><strong>wulf</strong>: Sorry, Father. Couldn’t help myself.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: Well, ya’ll get a bloody good wallopin’
if we get ’ome… For now, let’s see how well I taught ya.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: No! Fight on. Fight!</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Sinners, beware! God’s avengers are at
hand.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Go’ bless ya, Tuck.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Repent, heathen!</p>
<p><strong>int. castle - kitchens - day</strong>: The chef raises his
knife. Fanny appeals to the whole room.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Listen! Outside, your countrymen rise against
the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Is there one man or woman here who does not
hate him? Who has not suffered at his hand? Turn that on the Sheriff and
his bullies.</p>
<p><strong>int. castle - chapel - day</strong>: Nottingham slashes
maniacally. Robin is cornered, weakening.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: You should have stayed away, Locksley.
Fools like you never learn.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Ali akbar!</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Amen!</p>
<p><strong>mortianna</strong>: Agh… the painted one!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Bishop makes his escape. Tuck blocks
his path.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: So! You sold your soul to the devil?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No, I swear it, in God’s name.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Blasphemer! You accuse innocent men of Druid
worship while you practice the black arts yourself.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I am sure you would not strike a man of the
cloth.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Think again!</p>
<p><strong>ext. castle - balcony - day</strong>: Mortianna hauls Marian
against the battlements. Peers down at the battle. She spins in shock at
Aslan’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: What you fear is not below.</p>
<p><strong>int. castle chapel - day</strong>: Sword raised, Nottingham
has Robin backed against the altar.</p>
<p><strong>nottingham</strong>: What can your puny God do for you
now?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: This is for my father.</p>
<p><strong>ext. castle balcony - day</strong>: Robin grabs Marian,
pulling her back. Carefully lifts her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly
flash. She lashes out. A spitfire.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Let me go! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m your sworn protector. Any way I see
fit.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city square - day</strong>: Robin emerges from the
castle. Draped over his shoulder, Marian is kicking and beating at him.
He reaches the fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
the freezing water. She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles
back. Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers, enjoying the
show.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Robin? Oh God, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: How dare you?!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I think she’s feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>little john</strong>: We done it, mate. We clobbered the
buggers.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Are you ’urt?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It will mend.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Aslan, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I’m going home the easy way, Robin.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: You die on me, you son of satan, and I swear
I’ll bury you as a Christian in St. Catherine’s Cathedral with a
thousand monks chanting prayers for your miserable soul. You hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I have no strength, Brother Tuck.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: A fine friend you are! By the grace of Allah
and Jehovah we have won the day, and you want to give up the ghost. I’ll
pickle your remains in mead, lay you in your grave with a pig for a
companion, and mark it with a cross as big as this castle.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Please! It hurts when I laugh.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: See. There’s life in the heathen dog yet.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Here, Tuck. Look after him. You deserve each
other.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Robin Hood! Robin Hood!</p>
<p><strong>int. cathedral - day</strong>: A VOICE ECHOES from the
vaulted roof. A wedding is in progress.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: By the power vested in me by God’s holy
church, I now pronounce you husband and wife.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: You may kiss the bride.</p>
<p><strong>friar</strong>: Hurry. We waste good celebration time.</p>
<p><strong>king richard</strong>: May I kiss the bride?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Who would dare refuse his king’s request?</p>
<p><strong>king richard</strong>: You look radiant, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We are deeply honored by Your Majesty’s
presence.</p>
<p><strong>king richard</strong>: It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.
Thanks to you I still have a throne.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: My friend, a word of advice… Ride her better
than your horse.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nottingham cathedral - day</strong>: WEDDING BELLS PEAL.
Robin and Marian step out into the sunlight. The crowd cheers. At a
signal from Little John, the ex-outlaws shoot flaming arrows into the
sky…</p>
