<h1 id="extract">extract</h1>
<p><strong>inside the office</strong>: JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the
company, mid-thirties, is on the phone with his friend DEAN. DEAN You
should come by tonight. Half price well drinks while the game’s
going.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You always give me free drinks though. DEAN Oh
yeah. Well come by anyway.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah?… Might as well. No action going on at my
house, that’s for sure. DEAN Really? The wife out of town?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No… I just haven’t been laid in a month.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. This is pretty much normal these days… As
CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the manufacturing area,
past a big vat of orange extract, down through various stages of
assembly line production, then follows several bottles of orange extract
moving past HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short, beady-eyed
Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and mustache. Step is in his
forties. He makes everything he says sound as macho and important as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: You get this job through Manpower?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: I started here with Manpower too. Started out
on the line just like you.</p>
<p>****: Only I did better… 40 crates a day. Beat. Hector is not quite
sure what he’s talking about. STEP continues telling his tale in such a
way that the only polite reaction would be one of total amazement.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: I’m the best sorter in here. That’s why they
made me full time with benefits. I’ll probably be floor manager this
year. A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with too
many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail, lots of bad
piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of pockets and some kind of
gothy T-shirt – a look that ought to be out of style by now.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: My band’s playing this Friday, come check us
out. Hector looks down at the flier. It’s xeroxed with fifties clip-art,
cut out letters and the name of the band, “God’s Cock”. Hector just
looks at it confused, not knowing much English, not sure what he’s
supposed to be doing with the flier. AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes
are loaded onto pallets, sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old
pair of acid- wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny
pack, and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She’s pear- shaped
with short hair. She’s bitter and bossy, always shaking her head at
everyone. She sits on a stool with a clipboard, looks over her glasses
at Hector, shaking her head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in
her forties.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You see that… That new guy. He’s holding us
up. It’s not my job to tell them to hold the line either.</p>
<p><strong>gabriella</strong>: And then Joel’s gonna come yell at us,
cuz he’s not doing his job.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m just gonna sit here.</p>
<p><strong>gabriella</strong>: You’re not gonna shut it off?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not gonna hold the line. If they’re not
gonna do their job, why should I do mine. Mary sits there, arms folded,
lips pursed, refusing to pause the conveyor belt.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: If I don’t get home before about 8:00, she
puts on the sweatpants and once the sweatpants are on, it’s over – I get
nothing.</p>
<p>****: Shit. I’m gonna have to call you back. Joel hangs up and runs
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>on the manufacturing floor:</strong>: Boxes start to
accumulate and fall off the end of the line. Step sees this, runs to
shut off the line, yelling at Mary.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What are YOU doing?! What is he doing? A
YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory and
Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: All right. Now, what’s the problem? They all
erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay! Okay, everyone settle down. Now Mary.
Hector here is new okay? It’s gonna take him a couple of days, maybe his
English isn’t so good. You gotta be patient.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: That’s what I was tryin’ to say.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And Step, if you wanna be Floor Manager, this
is the kind of thing you’re going to have to deal with.</p>
<p>****: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let’s get this
cleaned up, and get rolling again. We can’t afford to fall behind today.
Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts right back up
with Gabriella.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You see that? We always get the blame.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Jesus… They’re like a bunch of goddamned
children.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Tell me about it. Sorry I missed the drama; I
was showing boy-genius down there how to back up a forklift. ANGLE ON
Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as he passes
someone.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s his whole career, driving that damn
forklift. You’d think he’d wanna learn how.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, I guess he’s got that band he’s in
too…</p>
<p>****: “Band”, ugh…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’ll bet dollars to donuts he sucks at that
too. Then you got ah… Dinkus down there…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Who, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, the other one – what’s-her- face – she
asked me – or rather “axed” me – for more personal days. Just like that.
I told her maybe if she figures out how to fill out the time sheets
correctly I’ll give her more personal days… Don’t worry, she will never
fill out her time sheets correctly. Joel looks down at the production
floor. Joel’s POV:</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off.
Mary and Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of old
hens.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Look at ’em… I am so sick of baby sitting
these assholes. I better get going… Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling
something about “sweatpants.”</p>
<p><strong>joel’s pov:</strong>: NATHAN, a middle-aged, overweight,
annoying guy is going out to the street to get his mail.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Please go back inside… Please just turn
around.. .Come on…don’t notice me…</p>
<p>****: Shit! Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down.
Joel begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan can
talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya… Nathan
settles in like he’s going to be there a while, leaning with his arms
folded, hanging inside the car, trapping Joel.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: How’ve ya been? I left you a message last
week. I don’t know if you got it or not.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, actually Nathan, I’m kind of in a hurry
here.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh yeah? You been busy?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, in fact… I should go right now actually.
I gotta call the office before they leave.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, real quick while I got ya here –
what’re you guys doing November 17th?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah, I don’t ah…</p>
<p>****: Actually we’re going to be out of town that weekend.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh yeah? Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, wait a minute – I’m sorry, I meant the
7th. Yeah, November 7th. You’ll be in town then right?</p>
<p>****: Ah…Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Great. There’s this dinner Leslie and I are
going to. It’s an annual thing – we do it every year with the Rotary
Club – it’s for charity. It’s just a whole lot of fun, and we wanted to
invite you and Suzie to be our guests at our table. It’s–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sorry, I ah… I just don’t think that’s
something we’re gonna want to do.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Really? Why not? It’s a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Suzie doesn’t really like
going to stuff like</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, we wouldn’t know anybody there. She
get’s kind of uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh no – It’s not like that. She won’t be
uncomfortable. I guarantee it. No, it’s not like that at all. It’s not
formal or anything. Trust me. It’s just a real loose bunch.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I just don’t…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I tell you what. Why don’t we do this – I’ll
go ahead and get tickets, since they’re gonna sell out fast. You talk to
Suzie. See what she says. Like I say, she won’t be uncomfortable at all.
Maybe I’ll have Leslie give her a call – you know how it is when the
wives talk, heh heh– Joel is about to snap.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Um, why don’t we talk about this later. I
gotta make this call before they leave. Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan
to raise off the window sill.</p>
<p>****: Sorry… I just gotta make this call!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Sorry, I almost forgot – the tickets are
forty dollars a plate. I know that’s a little steep, but the food is
fantastic and it’s for a good cause. So that’d be eighty dollars total.
There’s no tax or anything.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get inside and
make this call. Let’s talk about this another time. Joel has his finger
on the button to shut the garage door, waiting for Nathan to get out.
Nathan stops, just inside.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, and if you need us to look out for the
house or anything when you go out of town – Joel’s finger still on the
garage door button.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, just let us know. Where you guys going
anyway?</p>
<p>****: Ah, just sort of a vacation. Look, I gotta run. Joel hits the
button and the door starts going down.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Alright then. We’ll see ya. Nathan finally
steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge sigh of relief. Then,</p>
<p><strong>angle on the garage door:</strong>: As it gets halfway down,
we see Nathan’s legs, heading back towards the door. Nathan leans down
into frame as the door goes down.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, Joel one more thing– Joel lets the door
shut on him, and bolts into the house.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Man, that Nathan won’t shut up.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Yeah, what an asshole. I don’t even go into
the front yard anymore. That wife of his is even worse.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: We gotta get a new pool cleaner.I don’t think
that asshole checked the chlorine levels again like I asked him too…
Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She doesn’t seem to
notice as he starts getting fresh.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: .and every time he is here, he goes on and on
about some problem with the goddamn filter, and I have no idea what he’s
talking about… Delayed reaction – she notices Joel is getting frisky. He
gets closer, starts kissing her neck.</p>
<p>****: Ah,…Joel?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just… I’m a little tired,
and, I don’t know, it’s the middle of the week…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s not the middle of the week. It’s Monday.
Why can’t–</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Monday?</p>
<p>****: Oh shit!</p>
<p>****: What?!</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Idol! Suzie jumps up with newfound energy,
runs for the remote and turns on the TV. Joel just sits there.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Sorry honey. Maybe this weekend. Joel leaves
the room.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I gotta get a house with a bathroom that’s
doesn’t share a wall with the TV.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why don’t you do that in another bathroom.
You’ve got three of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It would look suspicious. We never use those
other bathrooms… Maybe if I had some insulation put in…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Insulation?… All I know is, you shouldn’t move
man; you’ve got a nice house. I mean you’ve got the American dream
really – you own your own company. I can’t believe you used to bar back
for me here, and now you’ve got all that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: But what do I have really? It’s a big pain in
the ass.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m always working; can’t stop or the whole
place will fall apart. And what good does it do me anyway? I don’t get
laid. That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably
gets laid more than I do.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, but he probably lives in a crappy
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hell, I’d move into a crappy apartment if the
bathroom wasn’t right next to the TV.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #1</strong>: Yeah, it’s expensive but it’s sweet…
Are you familiar with the Gibson humbucking pickups?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: No, sorry. I don’t play. It’s for my Dad
actually – for his fiftieth birthday. My sisters and I are all pitching
in.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #2</strong>: Ah, that’s nice… Your Dad would love
these humbuckings. They really kick ass. An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has
been waiting behind Cindy, trying to get some help, but he might as well
be invisible. He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side.</p>
<p><strong>male customer</strong>: Excuse me… I just have a quick
question… Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy.</p>
<p>****: So, what kind of music did he play? Both Salesmen’s eyes are
glued to Cindy as Male Customer finally gets sick of waiting and storms
off into the keyboard room.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I think he played like, jazz or something.
I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #2</strong>: Well this is an excellent jazz guitar.
It’s what Pat Metheny plays.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #1</strong>: Is your Dad into Metheny at all?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, I don’t know who that is. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #2</strong>: He’s like, a totally kickass fusion
guitarist. Are you into fusion?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I don’t really know much about it…</p>
<p><strong>salesman #2</strong>: I play fusion guitar so… Just
curious.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Um, do they come in any other colors?</p>
<p><strong>salesman #1</strong>: You mean different finishes? There’s a
sunburst finish we might have in stock.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #2</strong>: Yeah, do you wanna see it? I’ll go get
it.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #1</strong>: Or I could go. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>salesman #1/salesman #2</strong>: Oh totally./ No prob!/ I’ll
show you the case it comes with too. The salesmen practically trip over
each other, going into the back to find the other guitar. Cindy stands
there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then casually picks up the
four-thousand dollar guitar and walks out the front door with it.</p>
<p><strong>salesman #1</strong>: Oh shit!…</p>
<p><strong>the gibson!</strong>: They run out the front door, but Cindy
is long gone.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re not gonna believe this. Remember the
guy from General Mills that called a while back? Talking like he wanted
to buy us out?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I thought you said he wasn’t serious; he was
just sniffing around.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, well he’s serious now. He just made an
offer – I mean a real offer this time.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No. It must be part of some bigger strategic
move, because it’s over market value I think.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Wow… Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to
the window, looking down on the production floor.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I could unload all this… I could probably
retire…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I mean, yeah, there’s a lot of details to
work out, but this could be great. They’ll be calling back next week,
what should I tell them? Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her
arms folded, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Tell ’em hell yes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I already warned him. This is the last time.
I’m just gonna sit here. In SLOW MOTION, we see:</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I knew it. That’s what happens when you don’t
pay attention.</p>
<p>****: Uh-huh… Alright. Let me know if you hear anything else. He
hangs up, talks to Dean.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, he’s definitely lost one of ’em. They
think they might be able to re-attach the other one, but they’re not
sure.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah… I’m not sure how it happened, but we
have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so…
it was just a freak accident. There’ll be an investigation of some kind
I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, you have insurance for that kind of
thing, right?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh yeah. Of course. In fact, he’ll probably
get a huge settlement.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah. I would think so. I mean, it’s your
balls… Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Boy it really makes you stop and think about
how fragile we are – especially our balls. They’re just hanging there in
a little sack between our legs. At any moment they could be cut off
forever.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah. And your balls are really important man.
Your balls are everything. What kind of life would you have with no
testicles? Can you imagine that shit?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah… Beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You know Dean, my life wouldn’t be much
different than it is now actually.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Except for once every three months when I have
sex with my wife. In fact, I might even be better off…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Wait. Three months? I thought you said it was
once a month.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I did? I must’ve been lying. I don’t know…
Maybe things’ll get better when I sell the company. I’ll be around
more…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, I hope so. That would suck… I get laid
all the time. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah, it’s all right…</p>
<p>****: Actually, it sucks.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, sexual frustration is bad news… You know
what you oughtta do?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Get some Xanax.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Xanax? Isn’t that for anxiety?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah it is, but I find it’s good for just
about any phsychological problem. I mean, basically it just makes you
feel good, so it sort of works for anything. I even take it when I have
a cold. It’s probably great for sexual frustration. Want me to get you
some?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You know what else is good? Codeine cough
syrup.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s just good. Joel looks at Dean for a
beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Are you on something now?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No… Well, I guess I took some Vicodin this
morning. But that was just ’cause I was hung-over.</p>
<p><strong>pawn shop guy</strong>: Um, you know, I’m really not supposed
to say this… but since this belonged to your father, and since he passed
away and all…</p>
<p>****: You could probably get a better deal at a music store.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, that’s okay. Thanks. But I just kind of
wanna get it over with, you know? It’s kind of hard for me.</p>
<p><strong>pawn shop guy</strong>: I understand. He looks around to see
if his boss is watching, then counts off a FEW MORE TWENTIES, feeling
sorry for her.</p>
<p><strong>close on the wallet.</strong>: Cindy shuffles through three
or four different driver’s licenses. On one, her name says MISTY
PATTERSON. It’s a Kansas license. She takes another one out from
Colorado, with the name CINDY METZLER on it and puts that in front, then
puts the wallet away. A newspaper sits on the front seat. Something
grabs her attention.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the newspaper:</strong>: We see an article about
Step’s accident. There’s a picture of Step being taken away on the
stretcher. Cindy starts reading the article, with growing interest.</p>
<p><strong>cindy’s pov:</strong>: She scans the article, zeroing in on
certain words, “.. .potentially big settlement…” “…no testicles…”
“several million dollars” then back to “no testicles” then quickly back
and forth several times – “million dollars” “no testicles” “million
dollars” “no testicles” ON CINDY’S FACE - A look of determination. She
looks one more time at the name under the picture – Don “Step”
Wilkenson, then zeroes in on the words “Reynold’s Extract.” She starts
the car and speeds away.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: So obviously Step’s not coming back anytime
soon. I had to hire a couple temps. Is that okay?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, sure. How is Step?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Better. They say he’s going home in a couple
of days. Speaking of which, the guys at General Mills heard about this
whole Step thing. They’re worried. If Step decides to sue us – beyond
the insurance settlement – it could be a serious liability. They don’t
want to make an offer until this thing has settled.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Really? They think it’s that big of a
liability?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well yeah. Don’t you? I mean, think about it.
Imagine if you asked a bunch of jurors how much you’d have to pay ’em to
cut their balls off? I mean, I wouldn’t let someone cut my balls off for
a billion dollars. Seriously – unless there were some kind of really
expensive operation that could give you artificial balls or something.
Would you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Anyway, I wouldn’t worry. He says he’s not
going to sue us. Says he</p>
<p>****: “don’t want somethin’ fer nothin”’ and “What’s right is right.”
If we can just get him to sign something to that effect we should be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Boy, Step sure is being mellow about all
this.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, well I think when you lose your balls
it mellows you out. You don’t get as pissed off and aggressive about
things. I know it’s true for horses, and bulls.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Boy, it sure does make you think..</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh, by the way, guess who asked for a raise
today?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Who?</p>
<p>****: Dinkus. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Brian, you call everyone here “Dinkus.” I
don’t know who you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You know, Forklift-Dinkus?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh… I thought you call him “boy- genius.”</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a raise. I
said, “are you kidding? You nearly got someone killed last week,” and
then he blamed it on Dinkus over there.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You know Brian, you really ought to learn the
employees’ names.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, I was thinking about that, but hey, if
this deal goes through next week, I won’t have to. It’s not like I’m
gonna be inviting Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey man. What’s goin’ o– Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>dean’s pov</strong>: It’s CINDY, now working down on the
floor, on the assembley line.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Damn! Who’s she? Is she new?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah. She’s a temp.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: She’s a tramp?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No a temp. Quit staring.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Damn, she’s hot! Way to go.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hey, I didn’t hire her. She came here through
Manpower, like everybody else. They just sent her over.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give them a
call. You don’t usually have girls anywhere near that hot working here.
What’s the deal?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I know. I guess it makes sense though if
you think about it. Hot girls need a job just as much as anyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Do they really?… Huh… You just don’t see ’em
here. Usually your temps look like winos. And they’re guys.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You wanna hear something really weird?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: She came on to me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No way! Really?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah. I mean, I’m pretty sure. I could be
wrong, but…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey, I’m sure she did. Are you kidding? You
could have any girl down there.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know about that.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m serious. Dude, you’re the big shot here.
You’re the king of… What do you call that shit you make here again?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Extract. And spray-dried flavoring, and we’re
branching out</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, you’re the Extract King man. You could
have any girl here. I mean, I wouldn’t want most of ’em, but her… Way to
go Joel. Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: So how did she come on to you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, first she started asking me about what
happened to Step and all that stuff – you know, just sort of making
conversation?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: But it really seemed like she was flirting
with me, you know?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Then, she just sort of asked me out… I
think.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Really? How?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, you see that guy down there by the fork
lift? ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: His band is playing somewhere, at some party
this weekend, and she asked me if I wanted to go with her.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Wow. So, you gonna do anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What? No. No way. I couldn’t live with myself
if I cheated on Suzie… It’d be nice if I got laid at home once in a
while though…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Man, she is fine. You mind if I hit that then?
Beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I do sort of… We see a COMMOTION down on
the floor. Mary runs out of the Women’s locker room SCREAMING AND
YELLING.</p>
<p><strong>action</strong>: Mary runs over to where Hector is working,
hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My purse is stolen! It’s gone! He did it! He
stole my purse!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Now hold on–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I won’t hold on! I’ll call the cops!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What? I don’… No comprende…</p>
<p>****: Espera un momento Hector. Tu sabes donde esta su… uh, purse?
ANGLE ON CINDY, watching the whole thing– completely unfazed.Joel rushes
in.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Now wait a second. Calm down Mary. How do you
know it was stolen?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s gone! That’s how.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, what did it look like.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It was black with a fur, leopard style border…
As Mary describes the purse, we</p>
<p><strong>angle on address book.</strong>: Cindy turns to the Ws and
finds Step Wilkenson. She notes his address. She starts the car and
takes off.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: You can go ahead of me if that’s all you
have.</p>
<p>****: Thank you so much. I can’t believe I’m buying this stuff – I
work at the factory.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Really? I work there too. Or, ah, I used
to.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Really? You’re kidding! I just started there.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: I go by Step. Yeah, I’m the fastest sorter
there… As Cindy and Step get to know each other we</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sick of it Dean. I’m sick of being turned
down in my own house by my own wife. We’re turning into one of those
brother-sister couples.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Huh…Now that you mention it, you guys kind of
look alike too.</p>
<p>****: No we don’t!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Maybe things will be better after I sell the
company… Or maybe it’s just going to mean more time to sit around and
contemplate not getting laid. Dean nods sympathetically.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What about that girl at work? She still into
you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah… she was really coming on to me. She gave
me her phone number and everything. Told me to call her if I wanted to
go to that party. Can you believe that? And there’s nothing I can do
about it, but just be sexually frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ve got some Xanax if you want it. Like I
say, that always works for me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No thanks…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well maybe you should call that girl.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, I can’t. I can’t cheat on Suzie. I just
gotta power through it until I’m so old that I can’t get it up
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What about if Suzie cheated on you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hmm… I hadn’t even thought of that…</p>
<p>****: I wish she would.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You wish she would cheat on you? Wouldn’t that
bother you? Joel thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. I don’t think it would actually. I guess
that’s weird huh?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, it’s a little weird. Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: But see, then I could do something about all
this sexual frustration, without feeling guilty about it.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Do you think she would cheat on you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Nah…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p>****: Well, I don’t know. Hmm… Maybe if she were really tempted she
would. Like if some really studly guy came on to her.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: So you’re saying she would probably cheat on
you if she was put in temptation’s way?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You know what you oughtta do?</p>
<p>****: I don’t wanna do any drugs Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, no. Check this out – If you really wish
your wife would cheat on you, it’s not that hard to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hire a gigolo to have an affair with your
wife.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m serious. I know a guy.</p>
<p>****: You know a gigolo?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How do you know a gigolo?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: This guy Brad. He comes in here all the time.
He’s a friend of Vic’s. You could hire him to have an affair with
Suzie.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Come on Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why not? You said you wouldn’t care if she
cheated on you. Then you’d be free to go out with that Cindy chick and
get your ya-yas out – with no guilt. Problem solved. Man, what a great
idea. Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You know, maybe I will try some of that Xanax.
Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a little box and
pulls out a pill.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: I just believe that what’s right is right.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That’s right Step, and what’s right is for
you to send a message.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: A message?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You need to send a message so that a horrible
accident like this never happens to anyone else ever again. That’s
what’s right. And the way you do that is to take them to court.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yes Step… That’s why I called a lawyer for
you – that guy on all the bus stop benches.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Joe Adler?</p>
<p>****: You did that for me?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Mmm hmm… I just want you to do what’s right
Step. They start cuddling, kissing. Cindy pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m sorry Step, your doctor said you
shouldn’t get aroused.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: No he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Maybe it was your lawyer, but he talked to
your doctor. And your doctor said it’s very important not to get aroused
until after the trial… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: That’s okay… You’re so good to me Cindy. They
start cuddling again.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Look Step, you’re getting me turned on, I’m
getting you turned on… I better just go.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Shit… Do you remember what color that pill I
gave you was?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Damn. I don’t think it was Xanax. I think that
might’ve been Ritalin… Or “Special K.”</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah, who cares?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s just that, ah, Special K is a horse
tranquilizer, kinda has a weird effect when people take it but… well,
don’t worry about it… You might not want to drink too much more
though.</p>
<p>****: You know that thing you were talking about? About the
gigolo?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Do you think it would be wrong to do that? I
mean morally wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh nooo. Definitely not. What could be morally
wrong about it?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Look, if she doesn’t want to go for it, she
doesn’t have to. And if she does, then she’s the one who sinned, and
then it’s perfectly morally right for you to go out and boff whoever you
want.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, I guess you’re right. I can’t think of anything morally
wrong about it either. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And this guy, he’s a friend of yours? What’s
his name?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Brad. You want me to give him a call?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know. It’s kinda weird even talking
about it.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Look, this is no big deal Joel. I’m
serious.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah. I mean, you can’t lose. Just say you’re
hiring him to come clean the pool or something. See what happens. If she
doesn’t go for it, then at least you know you’re doing the right thing
by being faithful.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I guess you’re right… I don’t know. It’s
crazy. Dean pours Joel another drink.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Look. Have another drink. Think about it… You
know what? Why don’t I just call Brad and see what he has to say?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Alright. What the hell. Joel takes a big swig
of liquor.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So it’s two-hundred dollars then?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah, two-hundred.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well yeah, but don’t forget, I’m getting ten
percent.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What, so you’re a pimp now?</p>
<p>****: I don’t think they’re called “pimps” when it’s with male
prostitutes, okay. There’s some other word for it – it’s not a “john,”
but it’s something like that. Besides, I’m the one who hooked all this
up. And don’t worry ’cuz it’s coming out of Brad’s money anyway.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Alright, alright.</p>
<p>****: So it’s two-hundred dollars then?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Two-hundred and twenty.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Wait a minute–</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Um, I have a question?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah? Brad looks at Joel, deeply
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: So like, are you gonna, like, watch or
something?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No no no. God no! It’s not like that. I won’t
even be there. I’ll be at work. Remember? We already talked about this.
Brad looks blank, like he’s not getting it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What you’ll do, is come to my house pretending
to be the new pool cleaner. Then you simply try to seduce my wife. Okay?
If she doesn’t respond, you simply clean the pool and leave. That’s all.
It’s that simple. Hold on Brad for a long beat.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: So, uh, you’re not gonna touch my ass or
anything…?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: NO! Try to pay attention okay? I will not be
there. I will be at work. You come over to my house while I’m not there,
posing as the new pool cleaner and then try to seduce her… Brad finally
makes a breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oooh, I see. Sorry man. Yeah, yeah. I get it
now. You’re not even gonna be there…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah… cool. No problem. This is gonna be
great!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Remember, she might not go for it– Brad starts
to get a little too excited.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can hardly
wait! Awesome. Hey man, if you know anyone else who needs – you know –
what I do, like you know, lonely housewives and shit, maybe you could
tell ’em about me, you know… Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad
can’t seem to stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Cuz like, I figure if I did a few jobs and I
was, like, really good? Then maybe they’d tell their friends, you know,
and they’d give me a… what do you call those things?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Referrals.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah yeah, those things. Then those women
could tell more women and then it’d be like I was, like, uh… branching
or..</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Networking.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah, networking! Totally. Then if I got
enough of ’em, maybe I could quit my landscaping job and do this full
time. That would be awesome! Cause I hate landscaping. I like getting
laid a lot better, and my boss is a total dick…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Like I say, if your wife has any housewife
friends who might– Dean finally puts his foot down.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Okay, you’ve said that a few times now Brad.
Go on to your car. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Alright. Cool. Like I say–</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Goodnight Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Okay. See you later. Brad finally leaves.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Let me drive you home. You’re in no condition
to drive. Joel stumbles into Dean’s car.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Are you sure about this guy Dean? He acts like
he’s never done this before.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh no. He does it all the time. Don’t worry.
He just gets a little excited sometimes. He’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know. He sure doesn’t seem too
bright.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah well, what do you excpect? He’s a
whore.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Looks like you had one of those nights.</p>
<p>****: Where was I? Joel nods, tries to grin and look cool as he takes
a sip of his alkaseltzer. Then his eyes go wide, he almost does a
spit-take as something suddenly dawns on him…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh shit! He runs out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Dean?</p>
<p>****: Oh, hey Joel.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Thank God you’re home. Ah,… did that really
happen last night? I mean, did we go through with it – with that gigolo
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Ah, yeah. As far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Shit! What was I thinking?! We gotta call it
off. Right now. Can you call that guy, Brad?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Tell him I’ll pay him anyway, whatever, just
don’t come over. God, what was I thinking?!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Sure, I’ll call him. No problem… Oh wait a
second. I don’t think I have his number.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What? I thought you called him last night.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, but I got his number from Vic.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well get it from him again.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Vic doesn’t have a phone right now.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Shit! I’ll try information. What’s Brad’s last
name? Pause.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hmm… it’s something like,… I think it’s a
Mexican name.</p>
<p>****: Mexican?! The guy’s got blonde hair and blue eyes!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, I thought it was weird too – a guy like
that with a Mexican last name… It’s like Lopez, or Sanchez or something.
Joel looks at his watch. It’s 11:15.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Shit! Joel hangs up the phone, and rushes out
the door.</p>
<p><strong>continuous action</strong>: Brian walks in.</p>
<p>****: Joel, we gotta talk.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Not now Brian.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Ah yeah, it’s kind of important – kind of
really important. It’s</p>
<p><strong>about step-</strong>: Joel rushes past him.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Not now! We FOLLOW Joel as he rushes past his
SECRETARY.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Excuse me Joel? There’s a Brad Chavez on
line one for you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I can’t, I– Joel stops suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Brad Chavez. He said he’s done with the
job you guys talked about at your house? Do you want me to take a
message? Joel looks pale.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Um, no… He’s the ah, pool cleaner. I better
take that. Joel goes back in his office. HOLD on Brian, confused.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey, is this Joel?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey, it’s Brad. Mission accomplished dude.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I mean it worked. She totally went for it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What? What’re you…? You weren’t even supposed
to be there for another 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh really? I forgot what time you guys said,
and I was so excited about it, I just went over there. Joel sits down,
freaked out.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So you mean she actually ah… you guys…?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yup. It was easy.</p>
<p>****: Easy? What do you mean “easy”?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh, I don’t mean easy like she was easy – like
she was a slut or anything. I just mean it wasn’t hard to get her to…
Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. Tell me. Tell me how it happened.</p>
<p>****: I wanna hear everything.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Okay. Well, she let me in, so I went back like
I was cleaning the pool…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: .I don’t know anything about pool cleaning, so
I was just faking it. She was in her bathing suit… Suzie comes out and
lies on one of the reclining chairs.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: .So I struck up a conversation…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: This is a really nice house.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Is it your Dad’s house?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: No. It’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Wow, you look so young to be living in a house
this nice.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Oh, thanks. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Do you have any sunscreen? I forgot mine.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I thought that was pretty smart of me – to ask
her to borrow sunscreen. See, ’cuz that way, once she gave me some, I
could ask her if she wanted some too, and rub some on her back, instead
of just coming out and asking her to rub some on her. Pretty smooth
huh?… We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie’s back as she lies face- down
on the chair.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on her, the
rest was easy… We see Brad’s hands working their way down Suzie’s back.
Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel interrupts,
YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay that’s enough! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t need to hear anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Okay, cool. Hey, like I say, if you know of
anyone else, or if you ever need me to do it again–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye. Joel hangs up
the phone and falls back into his chair, in a state of shock.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Dammit !</p>
<p><strong>joel’s pov</strong>: Nathan, the guy across the street is in
his front yard, puttering around with the mail.</p>
<p>****: No… not today… Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull
behind a parked car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves
and crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his
driveway.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: How’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I’m kind of busy actually.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yeah. Well I won’t keep you. I just wanted
to let you know, I got those tickets to that dinner we talked about on
the 7th. I think I told you they were forty dollars a piece, but it
turns out it’s a tad more this year – fifty-five – so if I could go
ahead and just get a check from you guys…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Look, ah, we can’t go. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No, this is the 7th. You said you’re going
out of town on the 17th.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, but remember, I told you we didn’t
really want to go to this thing. Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about
to snap.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: But I already bought the tickets. I know you
said something about her feeling uncomfortable, but, like I say, she
won’t feel uncomfortable at all – I guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It’s just a whole lot of fun. You guys’ll
have a great time.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Look, I gotta get going.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Alright then… Joel starts to pull away.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, one more thing – Joel just keeps
driving, almost knocking Nathan over.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: So… How’s work?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It sucks.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Really? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Nothing. Suzie looks a little puzzled. They
keep eating in silence for a beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t feel well. I’m going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: So you’re in a band?</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: .Actually, I’m in five bands right now. But
Godscock is basically the same four guys as Fighthead, but Fighthead’s
more of a thrash/skatepunk thing. Godscock is more melodic stuff. Cindy
nods politely. Rory thinks she’s interested.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: So you comin’ Friday?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yeah, definitely. Ooh, I gotta go. Dentist
appointment.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Cool. Cindy leaves. ANGLE ON Mary, on the
other side of the room, watching them. She talks to Gabriella.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: See, there he goes again, slowing us down.</p>
<p>****: Now she’s a good sorter. They need to hire more people like
her.</p>
<p><strong>gabriella</strong>: She’s so nice too. Hector walks by. Mary
just shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t believe he’s still working here. You
know Silvia can’t find her wallet. Thinks it was stolen. And guess who
was in the locker room last? Hector. They both look at Hector and shake
their heads in disgust.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know, I could get a job at Southwest
Airlines. My Niece works there. I’d get better benefits than we get here
too.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Mmm hmm. I could get a job at Gemco. You
think they would put up with this stuff at Gemco? Mmm mmn. They run a
tight ship.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p>****: Good riddance… Brian steps in, taps on the door.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You got a second? I think we might have a big
problem here. I’m not sure what happened, but all of the sudden Step
says he doesn’t want to settle anymore. I think he might’ve talked to a
lawyer. Joel goes to his desk, sits down.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Like I say, General Mills isn’t going to make
their offer official until this settles. Joel considers this.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think Step is just chest-beating. He does
this all the time. He gets all wound up, talks big, then he always backs
down. And that’s with his balls.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: I’m sorry to even bring this up, but
you’re not living with the drug dealer anymore are you? Cindy’s parole
officer is a sad schlub of a guy, about 50 with bushy grey hair and a
mustache, he has a badge and a gun on his belt.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Nope. I’m staying at Extended Stay until I
can find a place… She smiles, flirtatiously waves her key/card.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: See?</p>
<p>****: I really feel like I’ve turned my life around. Thanks in large
part to you.</p>
<p>****: It’s okay. I’m just glad to see you’re doing so well… Ah, one
more thing I just need to ask you: We had a little incident up in
Templeton a couple weeks back where someone stole an expensive guitar
from a music store? Someone who fit your description. You know anything
about that?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Huh? No… I was probably at work that day.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Look Cindy, you realize you can’t
screw up anymore right? I mean, even something minor, and you could go
back to jail for a while this time. I’d hate to see that happen.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Well yeah, but why would I steal a guitar?
I’ve got no musical talent. I’m tone deaf. They both laugh.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Heh heh, So am I. I can’t carry a
tune to save my life.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Really? Wow… Cindy acts fascinated by Parole
Officer’s lack of musical talent. He happily goes on about it,
forgetting about the guitar…</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Yeah, I could barely sing the Star
Spangled Banner in school…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hey Mr. Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, hey Cindy. You can just call me Joel.</p>
<p>****: Okay Joel. So you going to the party tonight?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh yeah. Right, that’s tonight…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I was thinking about it. Are you
going?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yeah, definitely. Maybe I’ll see you
there?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I think I’ll probably go.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Do you have the directions?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m not sure…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Here, I’ll write it down just in</p>
<p><strong>case</strong>: Cindy opens her purse. We see at least FIVE
WALLETS, SEVERAL WATCHES, JEWELRY, etc. She takes out a pen and a piece
of pink, girly stationary and starts writing.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’ll also put my number on here. In case you
want to call me some time – if you want. Joel blushes awkwardly, like a
junior high school kid.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Um… Okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Hi there. Almost missed ya.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi. I can’t talk right now–</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Hey, I noticed you guys got a new pool
cleaner today. How is he? We’re thinking of changing services.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Look Nathan, I gotta… Wait, you mean
yesterday, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: The new pool cleaner. You saw him yesterday
right? Not today.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No. It was today. The new guy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What’d he look like?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Blonde haired kid, about this high, good
looking. Real good looking.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You sure it was today? Not yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You’re absolutely sure?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yeah. I know it was today, because I came
home for lunch. I was gone all day yesterday. Anyway, you think I could
go ahead and get that check from ya? Like I say, it’s 55 dollars a
plate, so that’d be 110 total. There’s no tax… Nathan leans up to
scratch his back. Joel seizes the opportunity and pulls away, burning a
little rubber.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What the hell were you doing at my house
today?!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh, umm… nothing.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Look, don’t worry about it bro’. I won’t
charge you for this one.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Won’t charge me for…? You had sex with my wife
again?!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Well, I figured we already did it once, so
what’s the big deal? I mean, she said to stop by if I was in the
neighborhood, so… Besides, I’m not gonna charge you–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Not gonna charge…? God damn you! Yes you are
gonna charge me! I’m gonna pay you! You’re not having sex with my wife
for free! And I better not ever catch you anywhere near my house ever
again! Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it’s a cell phone, picks
it back up and hits the “End” button.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I can’t believe my wife slept with that
guy.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well… I thought you said it wouldn’t bother
you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I guess I didn’t really think about it long
enough… I just wish it hadn’t been so easy for him.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Yeah, I’m tellin’ ya, chicks really go wild
for that Brad… Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, you’re right. He may be a stupid,
dull-witted moron, but he can get any girl he wants. Me, I had to work
for it. I had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch
of times, marry her. But not Brad. He gets to waltz into my house and
have sex with my wife just like that. Oh, and by the way? That little
prick was at my house again today.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No shit? What was he doing?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Take a wild guess.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Wow… You pay a guy to do a job, then he comes
back and does it for free.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m not going to let him do it for free. No
way. I’m paying him.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Really? How much?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. The same, I guess. Why?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hmm… So should I get my twenty dollars from
Brad then or… Joel shoots Dean an angry look.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We can worry about that later… Look at the
bright side, now you can call Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know… I feel weird about it. Besides,
she’s at the party, she probably won’t be home ’til late.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You know what you need to do?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t wanna do drugs Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Look, I know I joke around a lot, but this
time I’m serious. You should try smoking a little pot. It’s just an
herb, it heals. Stress can kill you, and–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I get paranoid when I smoke pot.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Not when you just smoke a little. Come on. You
ever meet my friend Willie? Great guy. Really great guy. He’s the guy I
got that horse tranquilizer from.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ve been reading about it – they’re making
technological advances now, coming up with great drugs that can make you
happy and won’t leave you with a hangover or nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Right on. Willie finally exhales. The exhale
seems to go on way longer than humanly possible, endless amounts of
pot-smoke billowing out . He finally hands the bong and lighter to
Joel.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I don’t know… I’m kind of a light weight.
I think that’s too much for me–</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Come on Joel. Don’t worry, this stuff isn’t
that strong.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He gets paranoid when he gets too stoned. Joel
looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong, partly out of being
intimidated by Willie.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah, what the hell. Willie instructs Joel on
the bong usage in the same condescending way a weight-lifting instructor
would.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Okay, now this is a gravity bong. Have you
ever used one before?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Umm, I think… no.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Okay, pay attention. Put your thumb right
here on the carburetor. When I pull the plunger up and say, “let go” I
want you to let go and inhale hard. Joel’s POV: Looking down the barrel
of the three-foot bong with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the
bowl.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Okay exhale!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You know, maybe I should just let</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Bullshit! EXHALE HARD! Mostly out of fear,
Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to Joel’s face, lights it and
starts lifting the plunger. Then pushes it down.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Let go! Inhale! NOW! Joel lets go of the
carburator, inhales.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s apartment – night</strong>: Willie, Dean and Joel
sitting around, completely baked – especially Joel. Dean makes some kind
of barely audible mumble – or did he?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What? Long pause.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Huh? Joel’s POV: looking from Dean to Willie.
Willie sits there with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to
Joel.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I thought somebody said something. Willie
looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to Joel’s paranoia. He
stares at Joel for a long beat. Then, in an instant, he’s right up in
Joel’s face.</p>
<p><strong>bwaaaaaaaaaaah!!!</strong>: Joel jumps back, scared shitless.
Willie starts laughing his ass off.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Haaaah ha… The look on your face!</p>
<p>****: Man you really do get paranoid when you get stoned.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, heh heh…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey Joel, why don’t you call that chick
now?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Time for you to call her and finally get
laid man! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It’s twelve thirty. She might be back by
now.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Alright. Joel gets the phone number out of his
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: So what’s this chick look like?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, she’s got brown hair. Pretty hot. Kind of
working-class looking…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What do you mean by that? Willie stares at
Joel for a beat. Joel can’t tell if he’s offended Willie or not.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Umm… Oh you know,…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is she kind of slutty lookin’?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah… Beat. Joel’s not sure if that was the
right answer either.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Alright! That’s how I like ’em.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p>****: Kinda nasty, heh heh… Joel starts dialing the number.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I hope I don’t wake her up…</p>
<p>****: It’s busy.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Alright. At least you know she’s home.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Try her again. Come on. Joel hits
redial.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Still busy… Man, what kind of person doesn’t
have call-waiting.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I don’t have call-waiting. I hate
call-waiting. Every time I hear that goddamn clicking sound, I wanna put
my fist through someone’s head. Beat. Once again, Joel doesn’t know
whether to shit or wind his watch. Willie stares at him, then</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Haaa ha! Man you really do get paranoid when
you’re stoned… Seriously though, I fuckin’ hate call-waiting.</p>
<p>****: Yeah… Willie grabs the phone.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Here let me dial. You’re too stoned.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ll tell you why you’re getting a busy
signal. This is my number.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Huh? But… Beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh… You’re joking right? Trying to make me
paranoid? Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn’t. He
just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR UNLOCK. Everyone
looks. CINDY enters.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hi. Sorry I’m late, I…</p>
<p>****: Joel? What are you doing here…? Willie stands up and walks over
to Joel’s chair. Dean suddenly stands up.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, it looks like you guys got a lot to talk
about here so I think I’m just gonna go ahead and take off. Later guys.
Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to leave, but
Willie blocks him.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Kinda slutty? Willie grabs Joel and throws
him against the wall. Joel tries to make a break for the door, but
Willie hauls off and punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins
as we</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Oh my God Joel, are you alright? What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m fine. I’m fine. I just ah… got my ass
kicked. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: What? By who? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It was just… some guy over at Scoreboards.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Let me drive you to the hospital. You need to
get checked out.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. I’ll be fine. I just want to sleep right
now, okay?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: You sure you’re okay? It looks like your nose
is broken, and your</p>
<p>****: Don’t worry about it! People get their asses kicked all the
time! It’s no big deal. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hi Joel. Brian wanted to see you–</p>
<p>****: Oh my God, what happened? Joel keeps walking, MUMBLES something
about falling down some stairs, goes into his office and shuts the
door.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hi… Did you talk to Step yet?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: He isn’t returning my calls.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Shit… We’ve got problems. He did hire a
lawyer – Joe Adler – he’s that personal injury lawyer you see on all the
bus-stop benches. You oughtta see this guy. He’s a real piece of shi– Oh
man, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I fell down some stairs.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Damn… Well anyway, I hate to say this, but I
think we’re screwed. There’s no way this Adler guy is gonna settle for
anything less then bankrupting us. Says he’ll sue us into the stone
age.</p>
<p>****: Shit… I gotta talk to Step. Brian looks at Joel’s bruised
face.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Man, everyone’s getting hurt. Cindy came in
with a black eye today. You hear how she got it?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah… no.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Step did it. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No he–!</p>
<p>****: What? Where did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s what she told Mary.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: But… Step? Does he even know her?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Apparently they’ve been going out.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I know, it’s weird. They didn’t even meet
here. They met at a grocery store or something. Just a total
coincidence. Joel looks down at Cindy on the production floor, his mind
reeling.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Anyway, we’re gonna have to hire a couple of
new people because</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yep. And if it’s okay with you, I’d like to
go ahead and fire Hector.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Fire Hector? What for?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You know, Mary’s purse? Sylvia’s wallet? It’s
gotta be him. Who else could it be? Joel looks down at Cindy with
growing suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. Don’t fire him. Just trust me on this.
Give him another week. If anything else is stolen, then you can fire
him.</p>
<p>****: Alright. If you say so. Brian looks Joel over.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Man, are you okay? Have you seen a doctor?
Joel’s Secretary BEEPS in.</p>
<p><strong>secratary</strong>: Joel, Dean is on line one for you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>****: I better get this. Brian leaves.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey man. Sorry I bailed on you like that last
night. It’s just that I don’t like to get involved in other people’s
personal shit, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I didn’t even know Willie had a girlfriend.
She must be new. Man, Willie looked pissed.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I thought he was gonna take a swing at you
there for a second.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: He did take a swing at me Dean. Several
swings. In fact, he beat the living shit out of me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Whoa, really?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Wow. Man, that really goes to show you – this
town is smaller than you think. You really gotta be careful. Joel hangs
up and walks out of his office, past his Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m not feeling well. I’m going to go home
early.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Shit! Joel slams on the brakes, turns around,
chases Brad’s truck down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They
both get out of their vehicles. Joel is livid.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What the hell were you doing on my street
again?!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Dude, you weren’t supposed to be home for
another four hours– Whoa, what happened to your face?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: tough, snappy comeback, but can’t quite make
it</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: The same thing that’s gonna happen.. Your face
is gonna look worse if… GOD DAMMIT! If I ever catch you anywhere near my
house or my wife again, I’ll have you arrested.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: For what? Suzie let me in. Joel is stumped –
Brad actually has a point.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What the hell is wrong with you anyway? Do you
do this with all your clients – just keep coming back and hanging
around?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I don’t know. This is my first one.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What?! I thought you were a professional!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Look man, I know she’s your wife an’ shit, but
you might as well know – I think we’re in love.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: In love?!</p>
<p>****: HA! Man are you stupid. You are so goddamn dumb. You think she
loves you? You’re nothing but a piece of ass to her. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I don’t think so dude.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, you don’t think so “dude?” Well did you
ever think about this: she doesn’t even know that I paid you to have sex
with her – did that cross your small mind?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Uuh..</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How about I go home right now and tell her?
Tell her you did it for the money. How about that loverboy? Brad
suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You don’t think so? Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: No… Dude, please don’t. Please? Joel starts
back to his car.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Look man, we really have a special thing going
on. Please don’t mess it up… Joel stops.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Don’t mess it up?! You’re talking about my
wife! My house! Stupid- ass! Joel gets in his car and starts it.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Dude, you can’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh yes I can… Joel peels out, drives half a
block and turns into his driveway.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Oh hi. You’re home early.</p>
<p>****: Hi. Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at
the pool. It’s filthy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So how was that new pool cleaner? Suzie is
caught off guard – wonders if she’s busted – but she plays it cool.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Um… What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What do you think I mean?… Did he do a good
job cleaning the pool?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Ah… well–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Did he get all the… leaves? It doesn’t really
look that clean. I mean I’m looking at it, and I’d say it’s pretty
goddamn filthy. Did the guy even clean it at all? It sure doesn’t look
like it.</p>
<p>****: Well yeah, I guess he didn’t do a very good job.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think he did a horrible job. I don’t think
we should use him anymore.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay. Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look
of guilt on her face.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Are you all right, Joel? You want an aspirin
or anything?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Wow, I don’t think you’ve ever been to my
house before. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I don’t think so. I would’ve
remembered…</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: This is my half brother Phil. Joel starts to
motion “don’t get up,” then realizes that’s not happening anyway. Phil
nods.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi… Hey Step, can we talk in another room.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Sure, let’s go out back.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: You know, my lawyer told me not to talk to
you.</p>
<p>****: You’re not here to try to talk me out of suing are you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, no… No, I’m just kind of curious about…
ah… So you’ve been going out with Cindy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Yes sir. She’s my girlfriend. We might even
get married after all this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets worked out.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: .so some of the guys at work are saying you
gave Cindy that black eye.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: What? That ain’t true at all.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I know it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: She got it from falling down some stairs.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hmm… Look, you might wanna be careful with
Cindy.</p>
<p>****: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, I’m not sure how to put this, but… You
know, you got a lot of money coming your way with this settlement. You
might wanna be</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Oh no. No, she didn’t even know about that
’til after we started going out.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Oh yeah. I didn’t tell her about it for a
while ’cuz I was kind of embarrassed, you know? You don’t tell a girl
you just met that you lost one of your balls. Especially a girl as hot
as Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p>****: You know she lives with this guy Willie right?</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: That’s her ex. She broke up with him. She’s
gonna move out. She just needs to get all her stuff outta there.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Oh yeah. She’s moving in with me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh. Hmm…</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Look, I know Cindy’s got some problems, but
she means well. She’s the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, okay… If you say so. Another thing – you
just might want to watch your back. Some of the guys at work who think
you gave Cindy the black eye were talking about paying you a visit – you
know, getting even.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Oh. Well I’m not worried about that. I could
kick anyone’s ass at that whole company.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: No Brad, we can’t. I’m sorry, but we have to
stop doing this.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: It’s not right. I feel horrible. Besides, I
think Joel’s getting suspicious. And you gotta start cleaning the pool
too.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: But I’ve never felt this way about anyone
before. And I’ve been with a lot of chicks.</p>
<p>****: Uh-huh… Look Brad, the truth is I love my husband. I really do.
This was all a big mistake. I’m sorry. I don’t know what got into me,
but we have to stop this. I want to make my marriage work again. I’m
going to tell Joel about the whole thing and just hope he forgives me.
And even if he doesn’t, at least I won’t be carrying around this
horrible feeling. I just can’t stand that he doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Uh… This doesn’t mean we can’t still see each
other though, right?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Ah, yes it does.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Because of all the things I just said.</p>
<p>****: Do you need me to say them again?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Can I see you tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: How about next week?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: No. Look, you gotta go Brad. Joel could be
home any second.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Okay, just go and we’ll talk later. Brad leans to kiss
her, she pushed him away and he finally leaves.</p>
<p>****: God, what a moron.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: So… you ready?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: The meeting with Step’s lawyer. Or lawyers I
should say. It’s today remember?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh shit… Alright. Joel drags himself out of
the chair.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: .You see, if both his balls had been knocked
clean off, he would be a good case, but not a great case: A man with no
balls is no man at all. He’s a freak. He’s barely human. He’s gross. And
a jury will never feel like they can walk in the shoes of a ball-less,
neutered, he/she freak. But Step. He’s still got one ball - barely. He’s
still a man. A man who’s very manhood has been jeopardized, but still a
man. And that manhood, that very sense of what you are as a human being
is hanging by a thread. Jesus, you can’t get more dramatic than that.
That brave ball, hanging on for dear life, hanging on for justice, is
going to be the hero of this trial. I’m tellin’ ya this Step guy is the
fuckin’ Holy Grail, the Powerball Jackpot. And you all laughed at me
when I bought those bus bench ads. But I knew the asses of those poor
slobs that sit on those benches and ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle
cars are our future. And I – Joel and Brian walk in.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Oh, hello. I’m Joe Adler… Everybody starts
introducing each other.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: .And when they sell the company, Joel and
Brian are gonna be the one’s who get rich, and–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And we’re the ones doing all the work.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: It’s bullshit man. We should get a piece of
it. I work my ass off.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Gabrielle and I work harder than anybody. I
should be making what Brian makes. If you add up all the crates I move,
I lift 10,000 pounds a day. Minimum.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: That’s right. Here he’s gonna make a
million dollars, and we’re the ones who do everything. I went to
college. For three years.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If we quit, this place couldn’t run. They
wouldn’t be able to sell this place for anything. JIM, a tall skinny
50-something guy with a ridiculously big mustache and a little paunch,
chimes in.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s why what we should do is, is we should
all go on strike – demand stock in the company before it sells. If
General Mills knew we were on strike, they wouldn’t buy this place until
the strike was over. That way they’d have to give us stock. Jim points
to his head, gives everyone a “how’s that” nod. It starts to build
steam.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: That’s right man. We should do it. We should
strike.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s right. I could get a job at Gemco like
that. At Gemco, all the employees are owners – even says so on the name
tags.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Mmm hmm. I could get a job at Southwest
Airlines…</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Ok gentlemen. We’ve gone through everything
and the only way we would even begin to consider a settlement would be
to the tune of the number you see on the bottom of page 18. Does
everyone have this? Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is
stunned by the number.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What!!!? We don’t have this much money! Not
even close!</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Not in cash you don’t. Of course not. But if
you were to sell off your assets: the property lease, the equipment,
the–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What the ff– Are you shitting me!? That would
bankrupt us!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: This is what I’ve been trying to tell you
Joel…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: If you think I’m just going to give up this
entire company that I built from the ground up– Adler jumps up, dripping
with phoney, forced indignation.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: How about what my client gave up!? His
testicles! How about that!? He walks over to the door…</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: In fact, I’ll make a deal with you - - we
will drop this case right now if you come over here and put your
testicles right here between the door and the</p>
<p>****: and let me slam this door like this… Adler SLAMS the door
ridiculously hard.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Go ahead. We can settle this right now – call
it even. I will drop this case right now if you let me slam your balls
in this door,</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It was an accident!</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Not according to our investigation. We
believe that, in fact, there was gross negligence…</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: I heard those guys up there are the guys from
General Mills.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mmm hmm…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: See, now they’re probably up there negotiating
right now – cuttin’ up the pie that we baked. That’s what it looks like
to me. The employees all nod in agreement. Employees POV: Adler pointing
at his balls, pointing to the door again, about to slam it. One of his
lawyers stops him.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: We gotta act fast. They could be about to
close the deal.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, and leave us out in the cold.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Yeah, then it’s too late. If they’ve already
sold it we can’t get a piece of it. We gotta act fast. We need to do one
of those walk outs.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, we better do it now.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Okay, who’s in? We need a show of force. Come
on, it’s now or never… We PAN around the employees as the idea builds
momentum, ending on HECTOR, who looks completely confused by it all.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Okay then, let me go back to my previous
offer: I will gladly come down on that price – I’ll come all the way
down to zero and drop this case – if you go over there right now and
slam your testicles in that door! Because–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t wanna slam my testicles in the door! I
want you to be reasonable! You won’t even budge one penny! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Like I say, if you slam your–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’ll slam your balls in the door!</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: I’m sorry, did you just threaten me? Brian
puts his hand on Joel, motions him to calm down.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look, we need to cool off a minute. We’ll be
right back. Brian leads Joel out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t need this. I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah?… What? But they are ill-prepared. No one
knows who should talk first. It’s incredibly awkward. They all look at
each other and mutter things like, “go ahead” “you first”. Finally…</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Umm… We were just uh…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, Rory was talking about how you guys are
doing this deal with General Mills and we just think that ah… We were
considering the idea of ah…</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Well, we just think that we should maybe get a
piece of it, you know cuz we do all the work… And if we don’t… um…
Joel’s in no mood for this. He goes off on them.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You know what? Fine. Fine. You’re all in
charge – all of you.</p>
<p>****: As of now. You run the goddamn place. Go ahead. In fact, you
can go up there right now and meet with Adler. He may slam your balls in
the door, but woohoo! You’re the boss! Joel storms out, leaving the
employees standing there. A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed
to do the talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
etc. “I was gonna say something but you interrupted,” “You didn’t say
anything when he was leaving, so I thought you were quitting. I would’ve
stood up to him.” As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back
to their posts, muttering.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Listen Joel, there’s something I have to tell
you. I think we need to be honest with each other. Suzie sits down.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: I’m not sure how to say this, but – well,
you’ve been so caught up in you’re work lately, and I’m here alone all
day and sometimes I just–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You banged the pool cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Wha… Suzie is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s what you’re trying to tell me right?
You had sex with Brad?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: You knew?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes I knew. I hired him.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Well I know you hired him, but how did you
know about–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t mean I hired him to clean the pool, I
mean I hired him to have sex with you.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: He’s a gigolo Suzie. Suzie is stupefied.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: But… what… Why? Joel is so fed up, he just
tells her everything.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I hired him to have an affair with you so that
I could have an affair without feeling guilty. I was really drunk and on
some kind of horse tranquilizer and–</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Brad was getting paid?… So you’ve been paying
Brad this whole time? All fifteen times?!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ Suzie! Joel sinks
into his chair, shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I only paid him once – well, twice. The rest
was on the house. Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: You wanted to have an affair with another
woman?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes. But I didn’t. Suzie paces around for a
moment, reeling, processing all this. Then, decisively,</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: You asshole.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I’m the asshole?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Yes! How could you?</p>
<p>****: How could I? How could you?!!! You didn’t have to have sex with
him. You could’ve simply said “No thanks. Just clean the pool,” but you
didn’t, did you?! No, you took him up on his little offer and had sex
with him – fifteen times!</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: None of this would’ve happened if you hadn’t
hired him.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay. I’ll admit, I made a big mistake. I was
drunk, on drugs, stressed, sexually frustrated and I shouldn’t have
hired a male prostitute to seduce you. But if you had simply been
faithful, none of this would’ve happened. Suzie just looks at him for a
beat.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: You’re sick, you know that? Beat. Joel can’t
really argue this point.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What do you see in Brad anyway? He’s
borderline retarded. You probably could’ve been arrested for having sex
with a guy that dumb.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: That’s it. I’m leaving. Suzie heads for the
door. Joel follows after her.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. You’re not leaving me. I’m leaving
you!</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Fine. Joel opens the door, about to storm
out, only to find NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the
doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, hey guys. Glad I caught ya. You guys
hardly ever answer the door. Heh heh. They are both so flustered, they
can barely talk.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Now’s not a good time Nathan. Joel turns
around, storms off back into the house.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, you guys goin’ somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: No. Look, we can’t talk right now.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, you think I could go ahead and get
that check from ya then? I’m just trying to balance my checkbook
here…</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Now’s not a good time.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: When would be a good time, you think?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: See the thing is–</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Okay tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Great, what time?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: I don’t know. Just come by tomorrow. I can’t
talk now.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Okay great. And if you could just go ahead
and have that check, that’d be great. It’s a hundred and ten. That’s two
plates at</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Yeah, Okay… Suzie shuts the door, cutting him
off.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey man… I know you probably want to kick my
ass, but–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I couldn’t kick your ass if I wanted to.
You’re a good 10 years younger than me, and I’m a pussy. So why don’t
you just leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I just wanted to tell you, I’m not gonna see
Suzie anymore. You don’t have to worry. Joel keeps drinking his beer,
stares straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: The last time I was over there, she broke it
off; told me to quit coming over… She said she was gonna tell you
everything – you know, about us. She’s really into you dude. I guess
that’s why she married you an’ shit… You’re a lucky guy… Sorry if I
messed shit up. Beat. Joel takes another swig.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Why’d you have to get hung up on Suzie? You
could have any girl you want.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah, but I want Suzie. And I can’t have
her.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You had her fifteen times.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah, but she doesn’t love me dude. It’s just
not the same… Anyway, just wanted to tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well… You told me.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Alright, later… Brad starts to leave. Then he
stops, turns around.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh, one more thing… I quit my landscaping job…
And I don’t think I’m really cut out to be a gigolo. So I was wondering
if you had any openings over there at your extract place?</p>
<p>****: Brad, you had sex with my wife. I’m not gonna give you a job,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Okay… Sorry man. Brad walks away. Joel stares
at his beer for a beat, thinking. He calls out to Brad.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hey Brad?… Brad stops.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know… Maybe come by the office
tomorrow. Fill out an application. I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Cool. Thanks man.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: We’re screwed. General Mills has pretty much
withdrawn the offer pending a really favorable settlement with Step. Not
only do we not sell the company, we could wind up bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So I don’t sell the company, don’t get the
money, I’m bankrupt, I don’t get Cindy, I paid a guy to have sex with my
wife, and she actually did it…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Hello? Nathan enters through the back
gate.</p>
<p>****: Shit… Nathan walks over to Suzie. She’s in no mood for this.
She acts as unfriendly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Why are you cleaning the pool yourself? That
new guy didn’t work out?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Yeah, didn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Boy, you just can’t get good help, eh?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: So, did you get a chance to write that
check?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Look Nathan, Joel and I aren’t going to that
dinner okay? Nathan acts deeply disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well gee, I wish you would’ve told me that
before I went and bought the tickets.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Joel never agreed to this Nathan, and neither
did I.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, it sure sounded like you guys were
going. Leslie was gonna talk to you about it, but you didn’t return our
calls. I mean, I already bought these tickets. They’re nonrefundable. I
really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me… It’s the last
straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes all her pent-up aggression on
Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Okay, let me be really clear with you then.
When we say “I don’t think so,” or even “I’m not sure,” that means “no.”
Why can’t you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, I just–</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Shut up! In fact, let me be even more clear
with you. We don’t like you! Is that clear enough? You’re dull, you
never shut up, you never listen, and we don’t want anything to do with
you ever again! Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He
starts to shake a little. Suzie just keeps going – it feels too good to
stop.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Is that clear enough for you Nathan?! Is
that…? Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.</p>
<p>****: Nathan? Nathan’s eyes roll back into his head, and he
collapses. Suzie SCREAMS.</p>
<p>****: No way… From JOEL’S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of
her car. Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance. He sees her
go into a room and shut the door. He stares up at the door for a beat.
Then, with a look of determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks
on her door.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh… Joel. I ah,…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What’re you…? What’s up? How’d you know I was
here?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Ah, actually, I’m staying here too. Down on
the first floor, around the back. I thought I saw you so I ah…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Well, come in. Joel enters, stands in the
living room. Cindy heads in to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Do you want something to drink? I think all I
have is Diet Coke. Joel notices MARY’S PURSE lying on the coffee table.
He stares at it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No thanks. Cindy comes back in with a Diet
Coke.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Have a seat. Joel remains standing, looking
at the purse.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s Mary’s purse… Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Right there. That’s Mary’s purse.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh that? No, that’s mine… So how are things
at work?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s Mary’s purse. You stole it, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: No. It probably just looks like it. There’s a
lot of those.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’ve never seen another one. You probably have
Sylvia’s wallet in here somewhere too, don’t you? And everything else
that’s been stolen from my employees.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Joel, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, I’m not. That’s Mary’s purse Goddammit!
Okay? Everyone blamed Hector. He almost got fired. Doesn’t that bother
you?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Joel, I don’t know what you’re–</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hector! Hard working guy, never did anything
wrong. And what are you doing with Step? You’re trying to screw him out
of his settlement money aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes you do! You’re the only reason he’s suing
us aren’t you? You know how much work it took for me to build up that
company? You just don’t care about anybody do you? What are you, some
kind of sociopath? Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You can’t even admit that you stole this purse
can you? You just can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: In fact, you probably can’t tell the truth
about much of anything, can you?… Cindy turns away from him, looking
down at the floor.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I bet Cindy’s not even your real name is it?
Who are you? Where the hell are you from? Cindy, still looking away,
doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You can’t answer can you? Because if you said
one true thing, you’d have to tell the truth about something else and
then it would all unravel wouldn’t it? Then you’d have to admit that you
stole this purse and God knows what else. Beat. Cindy still looking
away, down at the floor. We see her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel
doesn’t notice.</p>
<p>****: Well, I’m leaving now. Joel picks up the purse.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And I’m taking this purse with me. If it
really is yours, you can call the police and tell ’em I stole it… In
fact, I’m gonna call the police and report it… Joel walks towards the
door. Then Cindy slumps down on the couch, mutters something, still
looking down at the floor, her voice cracking slightly.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Please don’t… Joel stops.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Please don’t report it to the police. I’m on
probation. I’ll go to jail. For a long time.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well… Maybe you should’ve thought about that
before you started ripping off my employees. Joel starts to open the
door.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Joel? Please? I’ll leave Step alone. I
promise. He’ll drop the lawsuit. Joel considers this.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How do I know that?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You can keep the purse. If I don’t leave him
alone; if he doesn’t drop the lawsuit, then you can report me. Please?
Beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hmm… I guess that ah… Do you have Sylvia’s
wallet, and Jim’s watch? Can I get those too? Beat. Cindy nods, still
looking down. Joel considers it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well… Okay then. I guess that works.</p>
<p>****: And I guess you just admitted that you stole the purse. That’s
good, I guess… A step in the right direction… Joel sits down on the
couch also. With her head still down, Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel
doesn’t notice, looking straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So what’s your deal anyway?… I mean, how did
you end up like this? Joel finally looks over, notices that she’s
crying. He’s caught off guard.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: .Ah… Cindy? Cindy breaks down and starts
bawling.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay, now you see… that’s what I’m talking
about. You’re trying to manipulate me now, and I’m not gonna fall for
it… Cindy starts bawling even harder.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I really hope you’re not faking this right
now, because I’m feeling really bad. Are you faking it? Cindy shakes her
head “no.”</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sorry, I was just curious, you know, how a
person ends up like… this… Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically.
Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or comfort
her in any way.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Never mind. I’m sorry… Joel tentatively puts a
comforting arm around her and she leans in to him, crying on his chest.
He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even closer. As her
crying gradually subsides she snuggles in even more. Finally, she lifts
her head and they start kissing. As they get hot and heavy we</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Cindy? He looks around, realizes he’s alone.
Then suddenly looks worried.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh shit! He scrambles for his pants, then
looks relieved as he realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down
the pants, then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the
wallet and sees there’s still cash and credit cards. Then he looks up at
the chest of drawers and sees: Mary’s purse, Sylvia’s wallet, and a
watch, placed side by side. He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes,
grinning again.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Joel hasn’t been in all morning. can you
believe that?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: If we come in late, we get fired. And
here we’re working our tails off, and he’s gonna get rich. Joel walks
in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people. He walks over to Mary
carrying her PURSE.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Here you go Mary.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And by the way, Hector didn’t take it. Cindy
did. Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She whispers to
Gabriella.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Can you believe that? Blaming Cindy just to
protect Hector.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Step’s here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Really? Bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, he’s outside. At the loading dock. Wants
to talk to you alone back there for some reason.</p>
<p>****: “Man to man.”</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi Step…</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How you doin’? How’s your, ah…</p>
<p>****: Oh it’s okay. Some days it still hurts, but they’ve got me on
some pills. It’s not too bad I guess…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well… that’s good. They both sit down on the
edge of the dock.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Look, ah… Cindy left me. Joel’s nods, not
surprised, but sympathetic.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Wow… Bummer…</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Yeah, it is a bummer… You know, I thought the
worst part was having my balls knocked off, but you know what the worse
part is? Dealin’ with all this bullshit… I’m sick of that Adler guy
tellin’ me what to do. He’s a real dick.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, he sure is.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: The truth is, I just want to have my old life
back – I just want to go back to work. I’m a workin’ man; that’s what I
do.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah… I’m beginning to think I might be the
same way… I’m a little worried about what I’d do with too much time on
my hands.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: I just lay around and watch TV all day.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah,… I think I do a lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: The problem is, if I bankrupt the company,
there won’t be a job to go back to.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You don’t have to bankrupt the company.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Yeah, but then if I drop the lawsuit, you’ll
sell the company, and the new company might not hire me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, maybe I don’t have to sell the company…
You know I’ve been thinking; all these years I’ve been building this
company, dreaming about the day I could sell it and retire, but what
would I really do if I retired? It’s like that old saying – it’s not
about the destination, it’s about the journey? Step just stares at him
blankly, he lost him.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I guess what I’m saying is, too much free time
might not be such a good thing – like that old saying, idle hands are
the Devil’s playground? Step’s never heard that one either.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t do much book readin’.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What I’m saying is, I’m thinking maybe I won’t
sell the company…</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: that is, if you dropped the lawsuit. – and
remember, you’ll still get that insurance money – probably a couple
hundred thousand. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Hmm. That sounds fair… But under one
condition…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: You make me floor manager.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Deal. They shake hands.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hold the line! Mary shuts off the conveyer
belt.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay, listen up everybody. I’ve decided not to
sell the company… Gasps and murmurs among the employees.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And I’m making Step the new Floor Manager.
More gasps and murmurs.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And if anyone doesn’t like it, I hear they’re
hiring over at Gemco… But just remember, at Gemco, the owner doesn’t
know your names; you never even meet him, he’s at an office up in
Chicago somewhere and you get an auto- response if you try to email him
to complain about anything. Here, you can come up to my office any time
you have a problem. Thanks. Joel walks off. Brian catches up with
him.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Huh? You’re not selling?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s about the journey Brian. The journey.
ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know, if Joel’s going to put him in
charge, we should go on strike. You know, at Gemco, the union handles
the strikes and you don’t even have to– PULL OUT as Step cuts her
off.</p>
<p><strong>step</strong>: Quit yapping and get back to work or you’re
fired. Step walks off – maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads. LONG PULL OUT as
things get back to normal at the factory.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi… You doing okay?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Yeah, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I heard you were right there when it happened.
That must’ve been rough.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: It was horrible Joel. He came over to ask for
that check, and I just… Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: .I just lost it. I started yelling at him. I
said horrible things. He had an aneurism and I probably caused it.</p>
<p>****: I think the last thing I said to him was “shut up.” Those were
the last words he heard. Joel hugs her, consoling.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s okay, it’s not your fault… It’s not your
fault. Suzie’s crying subsides a little.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: It could happen to any of us Joel. Any of us
could have an aneurism. We could die at any moment.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I know… I know… But we probably won’t.
It’ll be alright. Suzie starts to regain her composure. They stand there
for a beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You wanna go get something to eat… or
something? Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Yeah, okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Thanks. They walk a little further. Joel
looks at the Chapel nearby.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Maybe we should’ve been married in a Church
like that one. Instead of the Botanical Gardens.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: I thought you liked the Botanical
Gardens?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, but… a church just seems more – I don’t
know – official.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: You think it would’ve made a difference?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know… So, are we still married?</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Well, legally yes.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I mean otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Hmmm… We can talk about it I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Alright. They walk for a beat.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You know, this is really bad, but… Oh never
mind.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, as I was looking down at Nathan there, I
was thinking… That’s the longest I’ve ever seen him with his mouth shut.
Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.</p>
<p><strong>suzie</strong>: Joel! They walk off into the distance as
we</p>
