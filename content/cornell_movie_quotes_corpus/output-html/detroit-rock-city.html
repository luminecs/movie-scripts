<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: KISS! The devil’s music!</p>
<p><strong>muffled, badly-rendered rock ‘n’ roll. scratchy,
guttural,</strong>: inhuman.</p>
<p><strong>boys singing</strong>: “I wanna rock ‘n’ roll all night and
party every day!”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Thank you, Cleveland! You’re a great crowd.
But after three and a half hours of kick-ass rock and seven encores on
top of that, I’m sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to
our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: What the fuck, Trip? That’s my bass!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: That was curly!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Just one more day of school to get through,
girls, before tomorrow night… Live! COBO Hall! Detroit, Michigan! You
wanted the best!</p>
<p><strong>all four boys</strong>: You got the best! The hottest band in
the world… KISS!!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Shit! It’s Jam’s mom!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: My mom? Oh, no! What’s she doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Jeremiah! Jeremiah Bruce! You get out
here this instant!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Oh, hi, mom.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: The devil’s body count, that’s what’s
up! Don’t you know what KISS stands for? “Knights in Satan’s
Service!”</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I had a nightmare once that something like this
might happen. I hope he doesn’t get grounded again. If he misses Peter
Criss’s drum solo, I don’t know if he’ll be able to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Lex, quit trying to always jinx things. Don’t
worry, dudes. Nobody’s missing that concert tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Jam, listen up.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Hawk?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Just listen up, man, cause we are in a
quandary.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Are you on the crapper with one of those
antenna phones? Sounds like you’re taking a dump the size of Butte,
Montana.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: It’s my Bullworker.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Anyway, listen up. They’re gone!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: What’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They’re just
fuckin’ gone! Please tell me you have’m!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick…?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Just check whatever you were wearing last
night. Now!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Whew! Oh, God, Hawk… I got’m! Somehow I musta
taken Trip’s jacket by mistake!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: He’s got’m!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Trip, he took your jacket by mistake. You must
be wearing Jam’s.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I’m really sorry about that, man.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Don’t be a fembot. So, are you like grounded
because of last night, or what?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Of course, but has that ever stopped me before?
Besides, my mom’s going to some church meeting and won’t be back till
late. No sweat… See you guys in school.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your
KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is
a psycho-bitch from hell.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: You’re one to talk, Lex. Your mom’s a fuckin’
dyke.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian
make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn’t give birth to me while
she was on LSD.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still
give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Both you assholes, SHADDAP!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Enough of the mom-bashing, all right? Lex’s
mom is cool about us crashing over here while she’s out of town. And if
it weren’t for Trip’s mom, we wouldn’ta smoked that fine Panama Red last
night. So leave the women who gave you life out of it. They’re both
cool.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Trip, you fuckin’ asshole.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: You spilled my Sea Monkeys all over the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Jeremiah, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Uhh… nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Ahh, sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: You’re going to be late if you don’t
hurry up and change soon.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Change? What’s wrong with what I got on?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: It’s dirty laundry for one thing and for
another, you still haven’t worn the clothes I bought you. You’re skating
on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn’t push my luck. Now get out
of those rags.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: But, mom!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Besides, those jeans are so tight I can
see your penis.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Someday you’ll see the futility in
forging a musical career with those idiots.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: They’re not idiots.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Now don’t forget you’re on the honor
system tonight. I’ll be home a little after one and if you’ve been
partying or playing that satanic KISS music… well, need I remind you of
the consequences?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Grounded for the rest of the year?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: You’re a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so
handsome.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: School. What a fuckin’ waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Will somebody please tell those chicks disco
is dead.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I
hate dogs.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Same species when you think about it.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Don’t stare too long, you’ll go blind.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big
ass.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: You know what they say about a big ass… big
shit.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Hey, that dork looks just like Jam.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Shit, that dork is Jam.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: So, Jam, who did your wardrobe, Tad the
preppie sailboat captain?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Hey, my mom had me over a barrel, all right.
After last night, I had to let her dress me today. It’s a give and take
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I
wanna hold onto them.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: They’re still at my house in Trip’s jacket.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: They’re what?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: She was standing right over me when I was
changing for fuck’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: That’s some sick shit right there. Did she
comb your ass hair for you too?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: If your mom so much as smells those tickets,
they’re history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year
in a row, the third year!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Don’t worry about it. They’re perfectly safe.
We can pick them up after school. My mom won’t be home. It’s no
problem.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: All right. After school we double- time it to
your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45
to Detroit Rock City.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: As they say in the Tampon biz, see you next
period.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Oof! Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Beth?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>study hall teacher</strong>: Mr. Bruce, Miss Bumsteen, is
there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Just a little pink eye. No reason to panic.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Jeremiah?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I wanted to tell you something…</p>
<p><strong>principal’s voice</strong>: Jeremiah Bruce, come to the
office immediately…</p>
<p><strong>whole class</strong>: Oooo, you’re in troubaaaallll.</p>
<p><strong>principal’s voice</strong>: Your mother’s here and would like
to see you right away…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce’s voice</strong>: Give me that microphone…
Jeremiah, you get your sorry self down to this office, mister!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce’s voice</strong>: I found some things in the
pockets of your jacket while I was picking up your disgusting laundry
today…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce’s voice</strong>: Cigarettes! Marijuana!
Prophylactics!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce’s voice</strong>: And something much, much
worse!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Holy shit, my jacket!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce’s voice</strong>: If you know what’s good for you,
you’ll get down here… NOW!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: I made an appointment with Father
Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard’s. We’re to see him directly where he
will register you on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: You mean, you’re sending me to… b- b-boarding
school?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: What else can I do? Oh, records and
magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah,
do you realize what this means? That you’re no longer content merely
hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces!
Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and
touch pure evil… and in Detroit no less!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Mom, three of those tickets don’t even belong
to me. They’re for the guys.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: And if the “guys” have parents who truly
love them, they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these
blasted things.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: It’s been a long time coming, son, but
you’re finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had
a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue
the tickets back together!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What are you, high?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: For once Lex is right. It’s over. Things can’t
get any worse from here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I hope you rodents have hall passes!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Wanna bet.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Could that be three detentions I smell?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Second floor girls’ john! Two minutes! He’ll
never look there!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Check!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You’re way out of your league, Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Fuck! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls’
crapper, remember?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam’s mom torch
our fuckin’ KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay
City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a
bathroom, I’d sure like to hear it!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Trip, it’s not the end of the world, okay? Quit
acting all squeezed out.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Oh, everything’s hunky-dory now that the shit
hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You
fuckin’ jinxed us!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: We’re clear, dudes.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: A skirt just came around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That’s Sherry VanHafton.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I’ve been in love with her since the second
grade.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whoa… she just farted.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my
entire life.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Weird…</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Peeeyeewww! That stinks!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Heh-heh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Someday you’ll have a son just like you,
Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and
smokes the dope just like you.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: If I’m anything like you, I’ll deserve him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I said, I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: If you truly are sorry, son, then you
better pray like you’ve never prayed before. God willed me to find those
tickets because He wanted to hear from you. He knows you need help and
He wants you to ask Him for it.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Please, God, help.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Wonder if you could smoke shit out of
this?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Maybe some tunage’ll chase those blues
away.</p>
<p><strong>dj’s voice</strong>: …and this is Simple Simon on the rock of
Detroit, W.A.R.P., home of the biggest KISS giveaway in the history of
the universe!</p>
<p><strong>dj’s voice</strong>: I got four, count ’em, four front row
tickets along with four backstage passes to the concert tonight at Cobo
Hall and I’m giving them to the 106th caller who can tell me the real
names of each KISS band member!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Too bad we’re stuck in electronics or…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a
crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>mr.j</strong>: Mr. Verudi, get back to your bench.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: But I gotta take a piss like you would not
believe, Mr. Johansen!</p>
<p><strong>mr.j</strong>: Put a clothespin on it till the end of class,
Verudi. You know my rule.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: But ever since my doctor put me on salt pills,
it’s been like Niagara Falls every half hour! Please, Mr. J! Have
mercy!</p>
<p><strong>mr.j</strong>: Salt pills? Don’t insult my intelligence,
Verudi…</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Jeezis, I’m taking a leak in my pants!</p>
<p><strong>mr.j</strong>: Get the hell out of here, Verudi! You disgust
me!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: I need to be connected to the W.A.R.P. contest
hotline… Now… lady!… Hello, is this me? I’m Trip.</p>
<p><strong>trip on radio</strong>: Am I on the air?… Yeah… Gene Klein,
Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter, uh, Criscoula… yeah, that’s
it!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Moron.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Why you little…! Over my dead body!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: I did it! I did it! We won!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: We won?!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Fuckin’ A! Woooooo!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: This is the best thing that ever happened to
me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we’re
actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find
a curlier scenario.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Stan Lee couldn’t think of a better one.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: The Chinese have a proverb: “That which appears
too good to be true, usually is.” There’s gotta be a catch.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes,
“Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole.” We’re going
this time and that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’m afraid our constipated little friend is
right this time, Trip. There is a catch.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Namely?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Our band “Mystery” is a quartet and we can’t
go on the road without our drummer. Jam’s mom said something about
sending him to St. Bernard’s, right? We gotta bust him out before we go
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: But… but, St. Bernard’s is way the hell over in
the next county!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: So? Your mom’s car has a CB, radar detector
and cruise control, check?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: We are not stealing my mom’s car.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Damn straight we are.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and
presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she
gets back from Cincinnati.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: And when is she due back from that
groinecologist’s convention anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Sunday, but…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Then lighten up. She’ll never know we touched
it. Alright, here’s the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo,
bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard’s and arrive at the train station
precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Simplicity, Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys
thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he
went to that concert with us.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: There’s only so much trouble an individual can
get into till it just doesn’t matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a
condition known as Absolute Zero?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: The hypothetical temperature characterized by
the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity?
Yeah, I’m vaguely familiar</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn’t
get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse’s ass. You
know as well as me he’d give his right arm just to see Peter Criss’s
drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, the least we, his only buds in the
world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last
curl before he starts serving his sentence.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Just for the record, I understood the last
part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no
fucking sense whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I was just explaining to Lex here what you and
I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he’d
understand.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I’m in on this
hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom’s car, I’m
blaming you. I’ll say you drugged me or something.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Curly.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ok, dudes, follow my lead.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of
school?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: About fuckin’ time if you ask me. I’m just
going through the motions till I drop out anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Hello summer detention.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: As I was saying, follow my lead. And maintain.
Elvis just showed up.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Five second rule, boys. See you on the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Excuse me, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>nerd</strong>: Hey, I’m responsible for that!</p>
<p><strong>miss hibbs</strong>: Then a cry from the crow’s nest… “Thar
she blows!”</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: KISS concert? Kiss my ass morelike. A nice,
fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evening’s plans.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Looking for something, rodents?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yeah, Elvis…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: ..Your ass on a lunch tray.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: On your marks and…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Elvis, you ain’t nothin’ but a hot dog.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Nooooo!!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Well, here we are back at fucking school
again.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Huh. St. Bernard’s. Figures it’s named after a
canine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Again, many thanks and praise to you for
seeing Jeremiah on such short notice.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Anything for a potential tuition… to
be given to charity of course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: God bless you, Father McNulty.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: He already has.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Before enrolling you, Jeremiah, let
me just say it would be greatly appreciated if your career at
St. Bernard’s was an uneventful one. Some students believe they can get
expelled through disobedience and recklessness. What they don’t
understand is even after God’s vengeance is meted out, He forgives. That
His devastating anger is followed by His nurturing compassion. In a
nutshell, St. Bernard’s may punish you even for the slightest
digression, but will never cast you out, even for the largest. So here
you are, Jeremiah… here to stay!</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Let’s begin the enrollment, shall
we?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Now, how are we gonna do this?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Mmm, pizza…</p>
<p><strong>delivery boy</strong>: Hey, you guys know where… Philip
McNutly’s office is?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yeah, I’m Philip McNutly.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Jeremiah, are you aware you need to
answer these questions, not just listen to them? Jeremiah?</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Please don’t become difficult this
early in your stay. I hate disciplining boys before I get to know
them.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Forgive me, Father. A young man here with a
pizza for you?</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Ah, yes! Send him in Sister
Conimaria.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Well, what’s the damage, pizza
fellow?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ten even.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: If he offers you a slice, you’re not the least
bit hungry, check?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Here’s ten and I’m donating your tip
to the church. The Lord thanks you.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Tell the Big Guy not to mention it.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: And not a moment too soon. I’m
famished. I hope you brought a lunch for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: No, but I’m not hungry anyway.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Well! It finally speaks. There’s one
barrier we’ve broken through.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: You know, your coming here reminds
me of a gospel called The Prodigal Son.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: There was once a farmer who had two
sons. Both grew up on the farm, helping their father until…</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: That was a very stale mushroom.
Where was I?… Ah, yes, one day the elder son decided to leave the
farm…</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Usually takes anywhere from ten minutes to
half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Shit! This is such a lousy view. How the hell
are we gonna know when he’s lit?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: He’s lit.</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: So then, the younger one says, “But
dad… I’ve been helping you on the farm my entire life! You never once
slaughtered the fatted calf for me!” And then… Forgive me, Jeremiah,
it’s just that… I’ve been telling this gospel for years and… I just now
realized it’s the work of some comedy mastermind! The Prodigal Son is a
barrel of fucking monkeys!</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: You kids can’t go in there!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: It’s okay, we’re old buds of Father McNulty…
How’s it hangin’, padre?</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: A little to the right, pizza
fellow.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That was another dude. Anyway, we’re here to
take our bud Jam to the big satanic KISS concert tonight. Okay with
you?</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Rock on!</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Give my regards to the guy with the
really big tongue!</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: What the hell are you doing, Sister
Gonorrhea, waiting for a bus?</p>
<p><strong>father mcnulty</strong>: Jesus H. Christ, look at all the
colors.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Oh, man, my mom is gonna send me to Alcatraz
for this and I don’t even care! I’m gonna see Peter Criss’s drum
solo!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Not looking like that, Mr. Rogers.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: We got you a change of duds when we picked up
the car.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: My mom’s hubcap!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Shit! Anybody know how long it takes to fix a
flat?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within
twenty miles of the speed limit?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk
till we reach Detroit? Don’t worry, these babies are built for
speed.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: I’m starvin’ and it’s way past lunchtime.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Totally. All I’ve had for chow was a packet of
Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Let’s stop in Sandusky, Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What’s in Sandusky?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Pizza, and I been jones-in’ for a pizza ever
since we left St. Bernard’s.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Only a car full of guidos and stellas would
ride someone’s ass on a two- lane road and beep.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Trip, huck that out before it stains the
upholstery!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Stop singing… NOW!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, Kenny, look! There’s a hunk of fawkin’
cheese on your windsheel!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Holy shit! We just pissed off the Incredible
Hulk, his idiot half brother and two circus clowns.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Stop the friggin’ car NOW!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Don’t you think we should at least pull over
and offer to clean it off?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What the fuck!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: The paint!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Do you realize the sheer, goddamn,
unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as
Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin’ STUPIDITY of what you just did?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hey, disco dude, it’s cool…</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Lemme paint you a friggin’ picture ahright?
Imagine if you will a 1978 Pontiac Trans American in pristine condition.
An appealing portrait, nesspah?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: BUT WAIT! What’s that spec on the windshield?
Could it be a wad of melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, and various
friggin’ meat products?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: And if it ain’t cleaned off?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Kenny, come on with the macho crap
already. Like this kid could take you in a fight anyway.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Answer me, hippie girl. And if the mess ain’t
cleaned off my car?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: It could… bake on?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: You’re a smart little homo, aren’t you,
hippie girl? But, while astounded at your nimble, friggin’ insight, I
still detect an issue hanging fire, namely: where does a sharp-witted
faggot like yourself get off doing such a dopey thing like that
there?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No really, I’m perplexed. I mean, could you
have done stupider if you were born without a FUCKIN’ HEAD?!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh! With the language!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Shut-up, Christine!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay, Kenny? I don’t mean to drain your keg or
anything, but could you speed up this process? Don’t get me wrong, we’d
love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of Saturday Night Fever,
but we’re also on a schedule. So step on it.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Are you gettin’ wise with me?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No, I’m dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I
please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Break his fawkin’ legs, Kenny!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Oh, you’re dumb all right, you hairy ass
punk. But please, allow me to clean the friggin’ windshield. I
insist.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: There. Nice and clean.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Oh, no, no, no! It’s the fag band!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Whoa! This is about pizza! Let’s leave KISS out
of it. Please.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: A bunch of guys who make bad music, dress
like freaks, and wear more make-up than all my sisters combined? These
assholes must be stopped!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s it, Kenny! I’m leaving!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Christine! You googatz in the head or
something? We’re on the side of the freakin’ highway!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let her go, Barbara, she’ll come back to
Kenny. She always does… Right, Kenny?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Kool and the Gang, now there’s real
music.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: But this… is crap!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: So. All that having been said and done, I
believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion. Namely: Have you
learned your lesson yet, puke?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, let’s recap, shall we? You slapped all
of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and
tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi. So, if
the lesson was that you’re a dick with ears and a really bad haircut,
then, yes… I’d say we learned it.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Excuse me, I’m a little deef-a- hearin’. Can
you repeat yourself?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears.
And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Oh, yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: That’s not what your mother said last
night.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: It’s not, huh? Well, then, tell me…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: …what exactly did my mother say last
night?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You heard me, prick. What did my mother say
last night?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Okay, fagmo… I’ll tell you what your mother
said last night. She said that I was the fuck of her life.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Not so fast, stella.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: When they wake up, they’re gonna come
looking for you jerks. You best hope they don’t find you, cause if they
do, they’re gonna kick your asses.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Right, stella, and we’ll deserve it. But let’s
really make it worth their while.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: By the way, when Kenny wakes up could you give
him a message for me. Tell him, quote, Kool and the gang bite my bag,
motherfucker, unquote.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample
make-up supply. You must have the entire Revlon factory in your
purse!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Very funny. I hope you choke!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Hey, look, it’s that girl.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: That’s no girl. That’s a stella.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Stella or no stella, we should pull over and
help her out.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh no, Jam. I’m not falling for that
twice.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Well, couldn’t you slow down so I can at least
state my case, Hawk? If you don’t like it, you can speed up and I’ll
never mention it again.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: What is it with you, Jam? You got a thing for
that… thing?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: She’s a teenage girl walking on the side of the
highway. They make very scary movies that start out like that.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, they may not make movies about four
dudes going to a KISS concert. But if they ever did, the four dudes most
certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Unless there was gonna be a scene where the
disco bunny blows the four dudes on the way to the show.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a
bunch of potheads… I’m hooking up with some people at this funky place
in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin’ me there?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: What’s it worth to you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What the hell is that supposed to
mean?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: It doesn’t mean anything. Don’t pay attention
to him.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Disco Inferno? Disco’s infernal morelike.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say
rock ‘n’ roll, baby.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well, your tee-shirt may say rock ‘n’
roll, but your breath says pepperoni, baby.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or
what?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What? That’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Trip! That’s so fuckin’ rude, man.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Oh, quit bein’ the wussy, sensitive guy to
impress her, Jam. She’s obviously not gonna put out. She’s a fuckin’
tease.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Tease? What the hell did I do to tease
you mongoloids?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: You got in the car, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead
you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of
nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Whatever… stella.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: The name’s Christine, not stella. And
there’s no need to be such pigs just cause I prefer Donna Summer or KC
and the Sunshine Boys or the Village People over KISS?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The Village People? They’re fags! You’re a fag
hag!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Come on, Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I can take care of myself, but thanks
anyway, germ.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Jam.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Whatever. Okay, Joe Burnout, let’s get
one thing straight here. As far as I’m concerned good tunes is good
tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of
the category. True, if I had to choose, I’d pick the category labelled
disco because I happen to enjoy dancing. Disco is just easier to dance
to.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit
dancing? I wouldn’t dance like that in private if you paid me.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Disco blows dogs for quarters.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Now there’s an intelligently biting
remark wrought with wit and irony.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hey, if you don’t like that one, maybe you’ll
think it’s funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yeah, why don’t you put your money where
your mouth is?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Why don’t you kiss my hairy crack?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why don’t you bend over, you’re looking
right at it!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: That last remark fell about 30 yards away from
making any sense whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hey, you’re right. “Bend over you’re
looking right at it?!” What’s that supposed to mean anyway?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Man, this is some kickass shit! Gimme a
hit off that jay will ya?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass.
She’s sleeping like a baby stella.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Let’s lift up her shirt.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: We made it!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Curly driving, Hawk. We still got two hours to
spare.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ample time to grab our tickets at the station.
See, up ahead. W.A.R.P.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car’s
pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down
upon us tonight, dudes.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Kind of funny, I thought He’d be pissed as hell
at me.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What was that D.J.’s name again?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Oh, I’ll remember it till the day I die. His
name was… Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan… No, simply,
similar…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Simple Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simple simon</strong>: The one and only. But can you kids
hurry this up? I’m due at Coco Hall in half an hour for the warm-up.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: We’re right behind you, Simo. Just wanted to
thank you in advance for handing over those burly-ass tix me and my buds
won this morning.</p>
<p><strong>simple simon</strong>: Your name isn’t Trip is it?</p>
<p><strong>simple simon’s voice</strong>: Simple Simon on the Rock, go
caller.</p>
<p><strong>trip’s voice</strong>: Hello? Is this me? I’m Trip. Am I on
the air?</p>
<p><strong>simple simon’s voice</strong>: I should hang up on you right
now, but you’re the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship
sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?</p>
<p><strong>trip’s voice</strong>: Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul
Frehley, and Peter…Criscula! Yeah, that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>simple simon’s voice</strong>: Is that your final answer?</p>
<p><strong>trip’s voice</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>simple simon’s voice</strong>: Trip? You just got yourself
four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>trip’s voice</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>simple simon’s voice</strong>: Yeah, you did!</p>
<p><strong>trip’s voice</strong>: Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin’
curly, man! Thank you God!</p>
<p><strong>simple simon’s voice</strong>: Whoa, easy, Trip, this is
radio, not “Taxi Driver.” Now listen up cause this next part is crucial.
Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and…</p>
<p><strong>simple simon’s voice</strong>: Trip? Trip? Oh, man, you
didn’t hang up on me did you? Trip? What kind of total moron would
hang…?</p>
<p><strong>simple simon</strong>: Well, there you have it. We had no
choice but to give the tickets to the next caller. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>simple simon</strong>: We got sodas in the fridge if that
helps any.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, here we are, dudes. One hour and thirty
minutes away from the concert of the century… ticketless. All thanks to
Wile E. Coyote, Super- Fucking Genius over here.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head
and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn’t have
happened if it wasn’t for you jinxing us. I just made an honest
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, Trip. What you made was a big,
brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone’s fault,
it’s mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip’s jacket by mistake. It’s my
fault and I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Please, Jam, we’re trying to vent some
hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who’s gonna
get pissed off at you?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Sometimes I think I don’t deserve friends as
good as you guys.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I have one question. How could a kid who wails
on the drums like it’s the only thing keeping him alive even think of
such a femmy thing to say?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Really, Jam, you tryin’ to make us barf?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Yeah, it’s like you’re possessed by The Flying
Nun, or something.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Welcome to the first open meeting of MATMOK,
Mothers Against The Music Of</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Uh… dudes?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Now there’s a woman who totally abuses the
privilege of motherhood.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Where’s the Volvo?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I can see that, bright boy. What happened to
it?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: It was stolen!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella
booted with your mom’s wheels.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: But we took the keys?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a
professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Okay, I’m just a little mad now! Jam, why’d you
talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I’m sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing
to do.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass
mouth! Okay, we’re here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half.
We’re totally committed. It’s time to brainstorm.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Here’s a suggestion. Let’s stop worrying about
the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo
situation.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren’t
gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo’s
on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by
Christine, the chop shop gourmet.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Now listen up. Here’s the game plan.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: …I mean, my mom’s got insurance. What’s the
worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle
that…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Cool, bro, now listen up…</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: …Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never
should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin’ trouble!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step
number one, we find us a scalper. I got… twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Twenty-five more’n I got.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: All I got is five. The rest is in the
Volvo.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I got…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Uh-uh. Don’t tell us, Jam. Just show us.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: So maybe we got enough for one ticket.
Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four
really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets.
What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give
Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I think we should try sneaking in.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Four dudes sneaking in? We’d get busted fer
sure. Bad plan.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket
stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all
“re-enter” the concerto. Voila!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Still too risky for my money. We’re running
out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the
team. I’m sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you
got better plans, go for it. We’ll reconvene at that intersection…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: …at twenty-thirty hours.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: One more time in English.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: For the next hour and a half it’s every dude
for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we’ll meet
over there.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Wait! I know how we can get in!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Jam, shut-up! You’re not allowed to speak,
remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket
or four. I don’t wanna hear it.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: But… my plan involves all four of us acting
together.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. Dudes? Later.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Look around you tonight, mothers! Look at
all the young faces! They smile and laugh but their eyes have lost all
hope! Not one among them appears to possess the love and fear of God…
This satanic group KISS has stolen their souls.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Oh… dear… Lord!!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: I don’t know how you got here tonight
and I don’t want to know either. All I know is you’re going to pay
dearly for this one, young man!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Mom, what’re we…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Just keep your lying, heathenous trap
shut, Jeremiah.</p>
<p><strong>parishioners</strong>: What a wonderful mass, Father/So
inspirational, Father/Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Thank you/Come again next week.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Next mass is tomorrow morning, sister.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Can we talk, Father? I’m desperate. My
son was about to defy God by going to that blasphemous KISS concert.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: In that case, come right in.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh my God! That’s Jeremiah!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Jeremiah Bruce from school. He and his mom
just went into that church. He must be in Detroit for the concert. Can I
go say good-bye to him?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Beth, I am not letting you wander the streets
of Detroit after dark.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m not going to wander. I’m just gonna go
over there.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: He’s with his mom.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Fine, as long as we know where you are. But
don’t be long. We need to be getting back on the road.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: She’s probably got a little crush on that
boy.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, chief? Need a ticket?</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: Second row center, seventy-five clams.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Dude, this is all I got.</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: Sorry, man, no can do. But I’ll be here for
a while if you scare up the extra gravy.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda
gravy in one hour?</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: The easy way.</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: You look a little scrawny, but it’s worth a
shot.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I can’t just walk in and take my clothes off.
It’s embarrasskin.</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: Guess you don’t want to see the greatest
show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire
did it, I’d give it my best shot. I’d learn the steps and practice in my
spare time. But this… tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it’s
way-too-spontaneous for me.</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: Yeah, you’re probably too young anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That’s
not the problem… They’re playing disco music in there, man.</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: Chief, here’s a little secret. Drink
heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do
you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: You sure you’ll have a ticket for me?</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: You have my solemn oath as a public
servant.</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: Hey, chief, you need a ticket? Second row
center, seventy-five clams.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: No thanks, dude. I’m beating my ticket out of
some poor, defenseless chump.</p>
<p><strong>scalper</strong>: What’s happening to kids today?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Like to sign up for the contest.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’re a little scrawny, but thanks to
the concert we’re low on amateurs. Name?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Pick a song, Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Got any KISS?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yeah, a man’s drink…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: …Dickey.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’m gonna need all the help I can get
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on
the rocks before?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at
the end of the bar sends her love.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whoa… she is a killer.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the
wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could
hit paydirt. She like ’em young. And since you look a little new at
this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act
it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at
her own head games.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Hey, you little twerps, gimme your KISS
tickets or I’ll pop your fuckin’ faces in.</p>
<p><strong>six year old #1</strong>: We don’t have any KISS tickets.</p>
<p><strong>six year old #2</strong>: Yeah, KISS sucks!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: I oughta kick your asses for sayin’ that.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: But I’m in a hurry so I’ll just take this
instead. Now scram.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Hey, little kid.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Shit! You just skunked my last ball,
you…</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Okay, booger, your KISS ticket or your
life.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Hunh?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Oh. Okay… But scream and you’ll never live to
see puberty. I’ll pop your fuckin’ face in.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Please sir, don’t beat me up. I do have
a KISS ticket, but not on me.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: A likely story. Hand it over, kid.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: No really. My brother’s hanging onto it
for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Hey, Chongo!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Hey, kid, that’s okay. I don’t wanna see KISS
that ba…</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Don’t try to run, maggot. Chongo’s an
all-state track star in every event.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me
and lives.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Look, you can have my wallet…</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: It’s not nearly enough, punk.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Besides, I was gonna take your wallet
anyway. After Chongo and his friends crush your ribcage like a pack of
Luckys.</p>
<p><strong>chongo</strong>: This fairy givin’ you shit, bro?</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: He was gonna mug me for my KISS
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Me? Mug? That’s nuts. I said, do you know
where I can take a piss.</p>
<p><strong>chongo</strong>: Okay, pimple dick, you’ve got the option of
walking outside with us or gettin’ dragged out. Either way you’re comin’
with us.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Please, sir, don’t kick my ass! I’ll do
anything to get out of a beating!</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some
extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won’t
be attending.</p>
<p><strong>chongo</strong>: How much cash do you figure?</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Take five for a minute, Chongo. Let me
do the math.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I can’t believe I’m actually entertaining the
notion of sneaking in. I oughta have my cranium examined.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Whoa. Danger Will Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>security guard’s voice</strong>: Hey you! Get back in
here!</p>
<p><strong>security guard’s voice</strong>: You’re not getting far,
kid!</p>
<p><strong>security guard’s voice</strong>: We got one just ran into the
field from the north lot!</p>
<p><strong>security guard’s voice</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Alright, wiseguy, you are so outta
here!</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Hey, what the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb fuckin’
apes.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Where’d he go? You see him?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Uh, next mass isn’t until tomorrow morning,
young lady. Run along now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Now it’s been a while since my boy had
holy confession. Could you…?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Consider it done.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: It’s about time you gave up on that
stupid dream once and for all. No son of mine is going to be a career
musician.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Thank you, Father. I’ll be back for him
before you know it; after I take care of some unfinished business.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Just knock loudly, sister.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Come along, son. Get into the booth.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is
my first confession in… well… a really long time.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How
many sins have you committed since your last confession?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Okay, ladies, hang onto your hormones. Here
comes our next amateur. Let’s have a big hand for Hawk!</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: You’re up, Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can’t…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’re not gonna chicken out on me now,
are you? We’ve got your KISS song playing and everything.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I-I c-can’t…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Look, people undress in public because,
A, they’re exhibitionists, B, they’re nutcases, or C, they need the
money. I can tell you’re not A, and I hope to hell you’re not B. So my
suggestion is, think about why you’re a C and let your body party, shake
your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can’t boogie no
more.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You’re right, Dicky. I gotta do it for KISS.
Gotta put a bag over its head and Do it for KISS.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Wow. I feel a hundred times better!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Thanks lady.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Maestro? As you were.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Come on, dude, we got a bunch of frisky
felines waiting for some entertainment! The show must go on!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Two hundred bucks?</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: You heard me, nad breath. My time’s
precious and I think that’s a reasonable price to pay for your sorry
life.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Look, I want to live, but I don’t know where
the fuck I’m gonna find two hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Chongo? Take him outside and tear his
ass out through his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Hold on! I know how I can get the money! I
just figured it out! Only you might wanna wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>chongo</strong>: I don’t trust him.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: I think he’s on the level. He’s too
stupid to try anything sneaky anyway. Look at him, he’s a moron.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: You got fifteen minutes and not a second
longer. We have a concert to go to. See you outside.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Keep it together, Lex. Anything worth fighting
for is worth dying for.</p>
<p><strong>roadie #2</strong>: Boy, this one’s heavy.</p>
<p><strong>roadie #2</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>roadie #2</strong>: Close that door!</p>
<p><strong>roadie #2</strong>: Peter’s gonna kill us.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: So, you see if it wasn’t for me, me and my
friends would be at that KISS concert right now… together.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Well, this is a unique confession to say the
least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I’ve ever heard
either. You sure you don’t want to talk about… oh, carnal knowledge with
a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher
maybe… or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad’s bed?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the
bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than
losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find,
what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer’s
kingdom. I’ll return in a little while.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Beth? I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Believe it.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Are you waiting for confession? I thought you
were Jewish?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I have a confession. Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I didn’t mean for that to be so… intense.
Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I don’t care. I wanna hear more.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’ve loved you ever since I first laid eyes on
you, Jeremiah. I’ve just always been too scared to show it.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Beth, I can’t believe you just said that
because that’s exactly how I’ve always felt about you… Call me Jam. It’s
my band name.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You don’t know how long I’ve been waiting to
hear that… Jam!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We’ve got to take this slow…</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Right, slow…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh, screw it!</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Okay, ladies, it’s down to… Troy the Human
Jackhammer…</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: …and Mr. Massive Head Wound Accompanied by an
Upset Stomach-Hawk!</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: No contest. The grand prize of seventy- five
dollars goes to Troy the Human Jackhammer!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Thanks, miss.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You’re too kind. I’m Amanda.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff,
Amanda, but there’s no reason for me to stick around these parts
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Don’t be so glum, Hawk. The night’s still
young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I’d be in a position to spend some money on
you if you’d get in a position and spend some time on me.</p>
<p><strong>priest’s voice</strong>: Where are you, son?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Uhh, tying my shoe.</p>
<p><strong>priest’s voice</strong>: Oh. So, have you thought of a
colorful confession yet?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Actually, yes. Last year I walked out of a
candy store with a Reggie Bar I hadn’t paid for, but went back and
apologized the next day.</p>
<p><strong>priest’s voice</strong>: Boooring. Think, boy, think!</p>
<p><strong>lex’s voice</strong>: I can’t believe you’re even thinking of
committing a robbery, Trip. You don’t pass go and collect 200 dollars
for pulling stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>hawk’s voice</strong>: No shit, dude, is this really worth
it? Sure you get your ass kicked nine ways to Sunday by that fucking
gorilla, but it’s still a hundred times better than getting it porked
for the next three to five.</p>
<p><strong>jam’s voice</strong>: And what about that girl, Trip? She’ll
never forget this night. Even if you get away with it, she’ll be scarred
for life. When are you gonna realize sometimes being tough means being
tender.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Alright, everybody, SHUT UP!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Okay, bro. You gonna have to do this sometime.
Might as well be now.</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: Evening, honey. Y’know what I am,
what this is, and what you have to do, so do it quick. The rest of you
kindly introduce yourselves to the floor and kiss it hello.</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: Do or die, bitch! Next time I let the
barrels do the talking.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: P-p-please, mister, I’m just a high school
kid…</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: Fuck school, that’s what I say! I
just went through the motions till I was old enough to drop out and I’m
leaving here with at least two fifty the easy way. Look where all that
studying’s gonna get you tonight. Robbed at gunpoint and possibly shot
in the fucking head… for minimum wage!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Alright, drop it or I’ll kick your ass!</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: Oh, yeah! You and what army?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: The KISS Army!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: This is real. This is not a dream! This is
real! I’ve pierced the inner circle!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Oh, God, they’re in there!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Dogs! Why did it have to be dogs!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Wake up, Lex! Wake up, man! This part’s gotta
be a nightmare!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: God, if you ever get me outta this, I swear I
will never masturbate again!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow’s
tongue grafted onto his real one? Y’know, to make it so long?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under
his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I’m not too up on
Gene trivia.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss,
right?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a
hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I’d consider
it… money… Hey, how’d you know that?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I have all your notebook doodles memorized,
Jam… Here.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Ann Arbor?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: My dad’s company is relocating him. We’re
moving. That’s why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it
was the last time I’d ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have
given it to you this morning, except… like I said, I was freaking
out.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I pass by this really cool tee-shirt shop on
my way to school every day and I know you wear those black tee- shirts
all the time. You look like a size thirty-five, but all the sizes were
in Roman numerals. So I got you an XXXL. That’s thirty-five, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Okay, you better have something really
sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your
mom will be here any minute.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks
ago I went to my cousin’s wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if
I wanted to take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I was insulted, so I asked her if I was
wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a
bath with me.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Oh, this is terrible… Please go on.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father.
Built like you wouldn’t believe. So I gave into temptation about a block
away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the
hour.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Well? Continue! Continue!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Okay… when she peeled off that gown, you’ll
never guess what she was wearing underneath.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Was it a teddy?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: No. Much bet… I mean, much more sinful than
that.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: A bustier?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Tell you what. You keep guessing and I’ll say
something when you get it.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Splendid! I love a good game of Name That
Nightie.</p>
<p><strong>priest’s voice</strong>: Satin underwear? Crotchless panties?
Leopard skin bra? Fishnet leotard? Leather G-string?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Okay, okay, you’re pissed off. I can see this.
So… Maybe what we need… ah-ha.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Play some frisbee, poochies?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Alright! I give up! I hearby and forthwith
defer my destiny to you mutts. I may be an intelligent, upright,
walking, homo-fucking sapien, but you fleabags are a force of nature.
So, I’m just gonna sit here and wait for you to decide. If you let me
live, I thank you. If you bite my head off, I’ll die knowing I did all I
could. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Well, how do you like that?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: You sonsofbitches could tickle a guy to death,
y’know that? Sure you do… Sure you do…</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: So, I jump into the car, hot-wire it
in thirty seconds and start driving. Then, suddenly I hear this scream.
The disco queen was asleep in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: You think it’s funny? How would you
like to have a stiletto heel smacking you in the temple when you’re
tryin’ to work?</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: You about done splittin’ a gut there?
We gotta get these parts to Toledo by nine.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Then maybe you guys’ll let me go,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Come on, whadaya say? You scratch my
back, I scratch yours. You let me go, and in return, I keep my big mouth
shut about your little operation here. Mum, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #2</strong>: You’re lucky you’re still alive,
wench. If you was a guy, we woulda thought nothin’ of sawing your head
off with a butter knife.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: What are we gonna do with her
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #2</strong>: I dunno, but she sure looks fun.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: Yeah, and payback’s a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Gin.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whoa. Some of this hard liquor’s a tad too
manly for me. I’m a brewski man myself.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn’t want to
give you whiskey dick would we?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Who’s Whiskey Dick?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Well. Obviously no one you have to worry
about… Woody.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: My name’s not Woody, it’s Haw-haw…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: …holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: But you do know Premature Peter, don’t you?
Shame, I just bought these stockings.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So
far you’ve seen me and my dick throw up. What’s next? Projectile
diarrhea? Man. What a stud, huh?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Believe it or not, you still have a way to
go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband… the
champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he’s the biggest and
the best… The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail
waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom
faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn’t gotten pregnant with our
son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You love him?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I just told you, he’s a big, hairy…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No, I mean… you love your son?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: More than anything in the world.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: And he loves you back, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: He’s a little spoiled, but I know he
does.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, shame on him if he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You’re sweet.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: My mom died of a heart attack while she was
having me. Man, I wish I had known her for even one day. If they ever
invent a time machine, that’s what I’m doing. Going back in time to meet
my mom. I’m gonna say, “Mrs. Pitchford?… or Miss Williams, depending on
when I show up. You don’t know me, but I’m your kid from the future.
Just wanted to thank you for the blue eyes, pug nose and for tying the
knot with a guy who didn’t mind diaper detail… Oh, and, uh… cut down on
the red meat, will ya?”</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: Gimme your gun, boy!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: No, you gimme your gun, boy!</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: Don’t tempt me, I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Not if I shoot first!</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: I don’t even think you have a
gun!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Neither do I!</p>
<p><strong>man with coat</strong>: Now, for the last time, take the
piece out and lay back down or your mom’s gonna need the White Tornado
to get the brains outta your ski cap.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Smile, you sonofa…</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Thank you! Thank you!… Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Call me… Dr. Love!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You guys better kill me before you do
what you’re thinking of doing. Cause when I’m mad enough, I can bite
down very hard.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: Sweet Polly Purebred’s got some
spunk, huh?</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #2</strong>: I’ll give her some spunk alright.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: We stripped that Beemer in fifteen
minutes. Bet we can strip her in fifteen seconds.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Now wait a minute, guys! Two against one
ain’t fair. Lemme go back and get my friend Barbara. You’d love her.
Tits the size of your head. You’ll feel like a little baby sucking on
’em. I swear, I’ll bring her right back. It’ll be a four-way… You guys
like disco? I teach disco dancing at my church. You guys look like you
got rhythm in your blood. Come on, free lessons if you let me go.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: I know a dance we can do. The
horizontal hustle.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I’m here for the girl and the car. You can try
to stop me, but I must warn you, it may be hazardous to your health.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: Too bad. He was such a young
idiot.</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #2</strong>: Ehhh. He was a stupid boy. He
deserved to die.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Listen to them. Children of the night. What
music they make… Hounds of hell? Say hello to dinner!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: One foot out of that office and your asses are
Alpo!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wow! Thank you! You’re cooler than the
Fonz.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Aaaayyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>beefy jerk #1</strong>: Hey, what about the dogs?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: You got a phone in there?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Call the cops.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ann Arbor isn’t… that far from Cleveland,
right?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up
all the time.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That’d be great. Hey, maybe someday your
band’ll play there. It’s a college town, you know?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I feel like such an idiot. Why didn’t I just
say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Let’s not think about the past. Let’s just
think about from today on. I’ll never forget you, Jam.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Tell me about it. Church will never be the same
again.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Coming dad. I’ll call you. Soon as we get a
phone. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I
can’t take any money for… I’m no Midnight Cowboy, y’know. It would only
cheapen the whole deal for me.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I’m not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk.
I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took
me up on my offer.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: …Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You’re a good man, Hawk. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to know where we could
find this… Dr. Love, would you?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: It’s company policy to hand over a cash
reward of a hundred and fifty dollars to anyone who stops a robbery. I
gave him the money and he took off.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Okay, well, thanks anyway. And let us know
if you happen to see him again. We’d like to ask him some questions.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: If I see Dr. Love any time soon, you’re
gonna have to wait till I’m done with him first.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: …hundred forty, hundred fifty. That’s all I
got.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I really wanted things to
work out for you, my weasly, dim- witted friend. You got spunk. Chongo,
give him a fifty dollar wallop.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Oh, no… Please, look. I…</p>
<p><strong>chongo</strong>: Hey, the jerkoff’s got drugs.</p>
<p><strong>little kid</strong>: Consider it a bonus, Chongo.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: At least I still got you, Stretch.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: This oughta be enough to get you to Disco
Inferno, Christine.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Come with. It’s not too late for you to
catch the fever.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: No can do. But I made a promise to get you to
that disco, and we KISS maniacs are men of our word. Besides… you’re
pretty cool… for a stella, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Here’s my number. Tell me how cool I am
over the phone sometime. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Disco Inferno, on the double.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I’m gonna ask you nicely first. Mom, can I have
my drumsticks back?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Again, can I have my drumsticks?</p>
<p><strong>lead idiot</strong>: Hey, I’m on the radio! Hi, good-
lookin’. We’ll be back to pick you up later!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Drumsticks are the least of your
worries, young man. You are in a world of…</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I know, mom, I’ve been in trouble for about
twelve hours now! Hellooooo!?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I’m gonna be spending the next two years of my
life at St. Bernard’s Boarding School, remember?! I’m gonna be outta
your hair till I’m a legal adult, remember?! That way, all you have to
do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and
voila! All is forgiven and forgotten, right mom?!! Then, you can spend
your days in guilt-free pursuit of more constructive activities like
telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are! That way you no
longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on
some normal level with your own child!!! And that way you don’t even
have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up,
and it’s a good thing too. Cause if you did, you’d realize what a LOUSY,
GODDAMN, SHITTY-</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bruce</strong>: Jeremiah… what’s gotten into you?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: I just lost my virginity in a confessional
booth! Lord have mercy!!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: For the last time, mom. Let me have my fucking
drumsticks. Please.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! That better not be the last
ticket! I hope you have another one for me!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Plenty, but it was all bad.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I found the Volvo.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Tickets?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Well, dudes, the only way we’re gonna see KISS
this tour is by some fuckin’ miracle.</p>
<p><strong>surly mom</strong>: How dare you sneak out of the house like
that! You had me worried to death! Don’t you know this is Detroit! And
for a degenerate band like KISS! They’re sick, sick, sick and oughta be
in jail with their vile antics!</p>
<p><strong>surly mom</strong>: Just wait until your father gets ahold of
you!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: No… You don’t think…?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Nah. Couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: It’s a miracle! A miracle!</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Whose laughing now?! Whose laughing now, ya
little shits?! I told ya… Over my dead body! Ha-HA-HAAA!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Take it easy, Elvis. Don’t do anything crazy.
Just give me the tickets before someone gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! This ain’t school
property! He’s not the boss of us here!</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: That’s right. This ain’t school. It’s not
about school anymore. Now it’s personal.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Come on, Elvis. We was only kiddin’. It’s all
in good fun. We run, you chase. Cat and mouse. You know.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Boys, this time… I win!</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Well… I still got my idea if anybody will let
me speak.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Go ahead, Jam.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: We all beat each other up, then, once we’re
nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged
and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Dude, you gotta let us in! Four muggers just
stole our tickets!</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: You expect us to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: Look at us!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: It was those assholes! They even stole my
wallet!</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Inside that you’ll find my KISS Army picture
I.D. and a hundred fifty bucks cash.</p>
<p><strong>trip</strong>: Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I was really hoping things
would work out for you, my weasly, midget friend. You got spunk.</p>
<p><strong>jam</strong>: This is it!</p>
<p><strong>simple simon</strong>: You wanted the best! And you got the
best! The hottest band in the world…</p>
