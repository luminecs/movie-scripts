<p><strong>scott</strong>: Then I have to guess you’re not “on

<p><strong>anton</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>

<p><strong>anton</strong>: Ask them.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Why would you want to know? Listen up, Pal.
THEY don’t go through the door. WE don’t ask why. That’s not a COST,
it’s a Benefit. Because we Got to Travel Light. You wanna lose sleep
over it, get over it, or get out. You wanted to go Through the Looking
Glass. How was it? Was it more fun than Miniature Golf…?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: I want a favor.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Why would I do you a favor?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Morning, John, who’s your friend…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Fella wants to buy my car.</p>

<p><strong>anton</strong>: The Secret Service Agent. Offed himself.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …he was off boffing his girl.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: He shot himself with a hide-out pistol.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Who frisked the sonofabitch? You ask
them.</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: Number one, the girl’s dead. Number two,
the hide-out gun the Agent shot with’s registered in his 1020 for the
past five years. The man who tossed him has been sacked. His name is
none of your concern. Now: what the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Sir, I am not here to question…</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: Well, then, what the fuck are you doing
here…?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Sir, as he said, he is here to apprise you
of a security leak…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …and…</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: To call your attention to what may be a
problem in discipline with this…</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: Granted. Granted. Granted. Fine. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: And. Sir…If I may…</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: When the operation is staged in Dubai…</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: What is this…?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: He…</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: …what the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I am merely saying, when -</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: Forget it. Walk away.</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: Yeah…you’re a pit bull. I said forget it.
How do we contact Anton?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: …Anton…</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: Your partner…He’s gone to ground…</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: And, wait, wait, wait, wait, what does
this mean…? When and if, any operation is staged which may require your
talents, I give you my word… You impertinent motherfucker. What the fuck
is with you, you’ve got on your “thinkingcap” all of a sudden…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I’d like to finish what I started.</p>
<p><strong>stoddard</strong>: And I’m telling you to Stand Down. Where’s
the kid?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Is there no operation in Dubai…?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: …in the Service. In the Service of his
Country. No less than had he died in Combat. George Gaines, a man who
gave his life to service, to protecting those who…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: …sucker did the Dutch.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I heard it was a training accident.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Nope, he Ate the Gun. Didn’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I’ve been out of town.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Punched out early, off with the girlfriend,
his Principal wanders off, winds up dead: hari-kari…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: …rather you didn’t smoke in here.</p>
<p><strong>burch</strong>: I put myself in your hands. Didn’t I…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I do not follow you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>burch</strong>: I reached out to you. I put my life into your
hands. I entered into a conspiracy with you. To commit Murder. Because
it needed to be done. I trusted you with my life.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I would never betray you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>burch</strong>: I trusted you with my life. And yet you
cannot trust me. There are things you have not been told. That’s right.
And now you’re all out-of-line, “Play me or trade me…”</p>
<p><strong>burch</strong>: There is an Arab World. To penetrate it makes
trying to join the Mafia look like a walk in the park. How would you do
it, Scott? We’re dying. We’re at war. And we have no intelligence. How
Would you do it? How would you infiltrate their clan structure? Where is
the interface? It’s at the whorehouse. That’s where they go to get
frisky, and that’s where we listen to them.</p>
<p><strong>burch</strong>: For the few, priceless hints that we get from
that fucking sandpile. Had the girl been there, we would have moved
heaven and earth - you know we would, and, we would have got her out.
She was not there. She got drugged up and fell off a boat, and drowned.
She’s dead. That man, That man a sworn office of the Secret Service,
went to get laid, and she died. And you are risking the lives of men and
women in the field, because you won’t take orders. How are you better
than him? Yes. You had best look sheepish. What the fuck have you got to
say?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: No excuse, sir.</p>
<p><strong>burch</strong>: You’re goddam right. Now: where’s this new
kid who got you all bothered. Where’s your partner?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …I’ll call him off.</p>
<p><strong>burch</strong>: The fuck you will. You’ve got nothing to say
to him. He’s gone to the ground. Where is he…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Terrible thing. Did you know him?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Did you know him…? Where did you know him
from?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …you know.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He wasn’t in the accounting office. You knew
that…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yes. I Did.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I didn’t think, he told anyone what he did.
Because…because…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: A few of us knew.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And all he cared about was doing his
duty…that’s all…that’s all… He used to tell me…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He was supposed to see me that night…After his
“shift”…We…His wife…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Did she know? His wife. Did she know?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: How could she? How could she…she didn’t know
him… Oh, the poor children…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …he was going to come to me that
night…after…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …after his shift.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …his shift - yes…</p>
<p><strong>burly man</strong>: …excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …after, after he’d finished driving him…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …him…?</p>
<p><strong>burly man</strong>: I said…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: man, who is backing</p>
<p><strong>burly man</strong>: Yeah. It’s a man’s world, pal - but
you’re in the wrong bar.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: …what the fuck did you do to my
friend…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …where are you…? No. Tell me later. Look:
LOOK: Forget the boat house. Look: Yes, tell me in…tel…look: tell me
when…GET OUT OF THERE.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …ohmigod…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: I…I brought you…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Why’re you screwing with the door…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Why’re you screwing with the door…?</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: I took the…I took the sign off… You had the
sign on the door. F’they saw me…f’they saw me, knocking on a door, the
sign on…they’d… An, I…I figured, you needed… You told me you wanted this
at Ten…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: …I don’t know why you…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You’re right, I’m wrong…I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: There you go, Pal. Hold on…</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Sure. I just…I just wanted to help.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: It’s been…quite a while since my last
confession. That…that “transpired”. On the rear face of a hill, in a
mortar attack. And I confessed that I was frightened. And I have to
confess, I’m frightened now. ’Nother “irregular Confession”.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …I’m about as frightened as I’m comfortable
being. And that’s why…I involved you. Which, I suppose, was
shameful.</p>
<p><strong>jackie black</strong>: Now: you did me the honor to Call me.
Now: you tell me how I might help. There in’t nobody here, but two
people in Green.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …this girl’s alive…</p>
<p><strong>jackie black</strong>: Then, you’d better go get her.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …terrible thing, grief…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …you want to comfort them, but you don’t know
how. I always think it’s better to Leave Them Alone…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: A relative?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: A psychic.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Well. Can we blame her…?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …who are you…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: United States Secret Service.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Guess again, ’cause I’m the Secret Service,
and you follow my directions or I will shoot you dead. Spread your hands
to your sides, please… Open them…</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: …the motherfuckers pulled the Detail off of
her…He was in town. Her father was in town, they pulled the Secret
Service Detail off her, to take him tomcatting. He’s been doing it for
years. That’s what they do. They turn the Secret Service into a bunch of
pimps. He took her protection, she got snatched…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: He’d let her die?</p>
<p><strong>female agent</strong>: …leaving the post…</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: The start of a campaign: Your daughter got
kidnapped because you were out getting laid?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Her father would let her die…?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Who knows if he knows. His ‘people’ would let
her die in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …her mother…?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: the earring and she begins to weep. She</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I need some money. I’m going to get the girl
back.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I need money. I need a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: I’ve been signing her checks for years.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Alright… Can you go this high, that’s what I
need…</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: …I…I don’t…is there anywhere else you…</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: Didn’t they tell you not to come?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Well, I guess I wasn’t paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: Five years ago they told me you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You want to gossip, or you want to do
business…?</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: Bobby; this is an American girl…?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: If that were so?</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: If that were so, why don’t your people go and
fetch her…?</p>

You heard the private sector?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>scott</strong>: …you’re out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: No, you’re out of your fucking mind, and you’re
out of your league, and my advice to you:…before some mercantile soul
shops you. …for this job, that’s what it costs…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: …that’s what it costs…?</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: That’s what it costs you. Go home, Bobby.</p>
