<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi, I’ve got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.
My name is Jack Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: His office is the first door on the
left.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr. Ullman?</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m Jack Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh, well - come on in Jack.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Very nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: This is my secretary, Susie.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hallo.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Susie, how do you do?</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Have any trouble finding us?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in
three and a half hours.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well, that’s very good time, very good.
Please sit down a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you
like some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, if you are going to have some, I
wouldn’t mind. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Susie.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh, and would you ask Bill Watson to join
us?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes, I will.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mom…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do you really want to go and live in that
hotel for the winter?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there’s hardly
anybody to play with around here.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time
to make new friends.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What about Tony? He’s looking forward to the
hotel, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: NO, I ain’t Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh come on, Tony. Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I don’t want to go there, Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, how come you don’t want to go?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I just don’t.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, let’s just wait and see. We’re all
gonna have a real good time.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Bill, I’d like you to meet Jack
Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bill, how do you do?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Grab a chair Bill, and join in.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Jack is going to take care of the Overlook
for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon
as we are through.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Jack is a schoolteacher.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Eh - formerly a school-teacher.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What line of work are you in now?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m a writer um… Teaching has been more or
less a way of making ends meet.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well this ought to be quite a change for
you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I’m looking for a change.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Our people in Denver recommended Jack very
highly, and, for once, I agree with them.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Let’s see, where were we? Yes. I was about
to explain that eh… our season here runs from oh May 15th to October
30th and then we close down completely until the following May.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems
to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh, it sure would be</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: but the problem is the enormous cost it
would be to keep the road to the Sidewinder open. It’s a… It’s a 25 mile
stretch of road - gets an average of 20 feet of snow during the winter,
and there’s just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it
clear. When the place was built in 1907, there was very little interest
in winter sports, and this site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic
beauty.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, it’s certainly got plenty of that.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: That’s right. And did they give you any idea
in Denver about what the job entails?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Only in a very general way.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: …the winters can be fantastically cruel, and
the basic idea is to…to cope with the very costly damage and
depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the
boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis,
repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements
can’t get a foothold.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, that sounds fine to me.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Physically, it’s not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is
eh… the tremendous sense of isolation.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, that just happens to be exactly what I’m
looking for. I’m eh… I’m outlining a new writing project, and eh…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: five months of peace is just what I want.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: That’s very good Jack, because eh… for some
people eh solitude and isolation…</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: can of itself be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: How about your wife and son? How do you
think they’ll take to it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Great…</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well, before I turn you over to Bill, there
is one other thing I think we should talk about. I don’t want to sound
melodramatic, but it is something that’s…</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: been known to give a few people second
thoughts about the job.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: I don’t suppose they eh told you anything in
Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t believe they did.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well, my predecessor in this job</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: hired a man named Charles Grady, as the
winter caretaker. He came up here with his wife and two little girls of
about eight or ten. And he had a good employment record, good references
and from what I’ve been told, I mean, he seemed like a completely normal
individual. But at some point during the winter, he must have suffered
some kind of a complete mental breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: He ran amok and eh… killed his family with
an axe,</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: stacked them neatly in one of the rooms in
the West Wing, and then he um… then he put eh both barrels of his
shotgun in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: The police eh… they thought that it was what
the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic
reaction which can occur when people are</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: shut in together over long periods of
time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, that is eh quite a story.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Yes, it is. Oh, it’s still hard for me to
believe that it actually happened here, but it did and eh… I think you
can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah, I certainly can, and eh… I also understand
why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well, obviously some people can be</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: put off by the idea of staying alone in a
place where something like that actually happened.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that’s
not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am
sure she’ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She’s a
confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tony, do you think Daddy will get the
job?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yeah, he did. He’s gonna phone Wendy up in a
few minutes to tell her.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi, babe.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi, hon. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Great. Look, I’m at the hotel and I still have
an awful lot to go through. I don’t think I can get home before nine or
ten.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Sounds like you got the job?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right it’s a beautiful place. You and Danny
are gonna love it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tony, why don’t you want to go to the
hotel?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You do too know, now come on tell me.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Now Tony, tell me.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now hold your eyes still so that I can
see.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That’s good, now the other one. Good
boy.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now Danny, when you were brushing your
teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright
flashing lights, or anything at all strange?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Do you remember when you were brushing your
teeth?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What’s the next thing you remember after you
were brushing your teeth?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mommy saying, ‘Wake up, wake up, wake up
Danny, wake up.’</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now Danny, can you remember what you were
doing just before you started brushing your teeth?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Talking to Tony.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Is Tony one of your animals?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No. It’s the little boy that lives in my
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Tony is his imaginary friend.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Oh,</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: if you were to open your mouth now, could I
see Tony?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because he hides.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Where does he go?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: To my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Does Tony ever tell you to do things?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t want to talk about Tony anymore.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Okay. That’s fine. All right Danny.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now I’m going to ask you to do me a favor,
and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes, I’d like you to.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: We’re just going to go into one of the other
rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I’ll come back and check on you,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Shall we go into the living room?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mrs. Torrance, I don’t think you have
anything to worry about. I’m quite sure there is nothing physically
wrong with Danny.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine
now, but you should have seen him.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Oh I know. Kids can scare you to death, but
believe me these episodes are not at all uncommon, and they look much
worse than they are.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: But eh what was the matter with him?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these
episodes with kids are never explained. They are brought on by emotional
factors, and they rarely occur again.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: They’re more akin to auto-hypnosis, a kind
of self induced trance. If it re-occurs which I doubt</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: you can always think about having some tests
done.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh, I’m…I’m sure you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Have you been in Boulder long,
Mrs. Torrance?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Only about three months. Eh we’re from
Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Did the appearance of Danny’s imaginary
friend…?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Tony.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Did Tony’s first appearance happen to
coincide with your arrival here?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No, um let’s see I guess Danny started talkin
to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Did he adjust well to school?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No. He didn’t like it too much at first, and
then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while, and, yeah, I…I
guess that’s about the time when I first noticed that he was talking to
Tony.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What sort of injury did he have?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Ah he dislocated his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How did he manage to do that?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well it’s just one of those things. You know…
purely an accident, um. My husband had oh… been drinking, and he came
home about three hours late, so he wasn’t exactly in the greatest mood
that night. And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all
over the room… and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him
away from them. It’s…it’s just the sort of thing you do a hundred times
with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this
particular occasion my husband just… used too much strength and he
injured Danny’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Anyway, something good did come out of it all
because he said:</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: “Wendy, I’m never gonna touch another drop
and if I do you can leave me”, and he didn’t and he hasn’t had any
alcohol in eh five months.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels
so different.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh…huh.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well you should have eaten your breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: We’ll get something as soon as we get to the
hotel, okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey, wasn’t it around here that the Donner
party got snowbound?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think that was farther west in the
Sierras.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What was the Donner party?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There were a party of settlers in the covered
wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to
resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You mean they ate each other up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They had to, in order to survive.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t worry, Mom. I know all about
cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: See, it’s okay. He saw it all on the
television.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: What time does the plane leave?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Eight thirty.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well, that still gives up plenty of time to
go over everything first.</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Goodbye Mr. Ullman.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Good morning Jack. I hope you haven’t been
waiting too long.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite
to eat.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Good. Glad you made it before they shut down
the kitchen. Is your family having a look around?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, my son’s discovered the games room.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh… Has your luggage been brought in?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right there.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh fine. Well in view of all the ground that
we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your
apartment and then get started straight away.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Bill, would you have the Torrances’ things
brought in their apartment.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’d better collect my family first.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: This is our Colorado Lounge.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh, it’s beautiful. My God, this place is
fantastic, isn’t it hon?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure is.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: God, I’ve never seen anything like this
before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Yes, I believe they are based mainly on
Navajo and Apache motifs.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh well they’re really gorgeous. As a matter
of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh this old place has had an illustrious
past. In its heyday it was one of the stopping places for the jet
set,</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: even before anybody knew what a jet set was.
We’ve had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Royalty?</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: All the best people.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of
the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Goodbye Mr. Ullman.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Goodbye girls.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: And here are your quarters.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Living Room, bedroom, bathroom, and a small
bedroom for your son.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Perfect for a child.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well the place is very nicely self-
contained, easy to keep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Cosy.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel
like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, it’s very… homely.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: This is our famous hedge maze. It’s quite an
attraction around here. The walls are thirteen feet high and the hedges
are about as old as the hotel itself. It’s a lot of fun,</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: but I wouldn’t go in there unless I had an
hour to spare to find my way out.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: When was the Overlook built?</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Ah… construction started in 1907. It was
finished in 1909. The site is supposed to be located on an Indian burial
ground, and I believe they actually had to repel a few Indian attacks as
they were building it.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: That’s our Snowcat. Can you both drive a
car?</p>
<p><strong>jack &amp; wendy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: That’s fine because basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car and it won’t take you long to get the hang
of it.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: As a matter of fact we eh… brought a
decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and
gold are my favorite colors.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh…well this is our gold ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh, I’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: We can accommodate up to three hundred
people here very comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Boy, I bet you we could really have a good
party in this room, huh hon?</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: I’m afraid you’re not going to do too well
here unless you’ve brought your own supplies. We always remove all the
booze from the premises when we shut down:</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: that reduces the insurance that we normally
have to carry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Well then, you’re in luck.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to
Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr. Halloran, I’m Jack, and this is my wife,
Winifred.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Glad to meet you, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Glad to meet you, Winifred.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: The Torrances are going to take care of the
Overlook for us this winter.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Oh, that’s just great. How do you folks
like our hotel so far?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh it’s just wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi Danny!</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I found him outside looking for you.</p>
<p>****: Danny, did you get tired</p>
<p>****: of bombing the universe?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny, come on over here.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Thank you, Susie.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Dick, if you’re ready to do it now, I think
it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen,
while I continue on with Jack.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: It will be a pleasure. Right this way
Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Great. See you later, hon.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bye darling.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you
as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m a Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Oh Wendy. That’s nice. That’s the
prettiest.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: God. This is the kitchen, huh?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Yeah, this is it. How do you like it,
Danny? Is it big enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, it’s the biggest place I’ve ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah. This whole place is such an enormous
maze, I feel I’ll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come
in.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Don’t let it get you down Mrs. Torrance -
it’s big but it still ain’t nothing but a kitchen… a lot of the stuff
you’ll never have to touch.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I wouldn’t know what to do with it if I
did.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well one thing for sure, you don’t have to
worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and
never have the same menu twice.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Now right here is our walk-in freezer.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Now this is where we keep all of out meat.
You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers. You
got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb. Do
you like lamb, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: You don’t? Well what’s your favorite food
then?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: French Fries and Ketchup.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well I think we can manage that too, Doc.
Come along now. Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Mr. Halloran,</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: how did you know we called him ‘Doc’?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Beg pardon?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Doc. You called Danny ‘Doc’ twice just
now.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well I guess I probably heard you call him
that.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, it’s possible, but I honestly don’t
remember calling him that since we’ve been with you.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Me ah - what’s up, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Now this is the storeroom.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: In here, Mrs. Torrance, is where we keep
all the dried goods and the canned goods. We got canned fruits and
vegetables; canned fish and meats; hot and cold cereals.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Post Toasties, Cornflakes, Sugar Puffs,
Rice Krispies, Oatmeal, Wheatina and Cream of Wheat.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: We got a dozen jugs of black molasses, we
got sixty boxes of dried milk, thirty twelve pound bags of sugar.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: How’d you like some ice cream, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: sociables, finger rolls and seven kinds of
what-have-you.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Now we got dried peaches, dried apricots,
dried raisins and dried prunes.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: You know, Mrs. Torrance, you gotta keep
regular, if you want to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: How’re you getting on?</p>
<p><strong>halloran &amp; wendy</strong>: Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few
minutes? We’re on our way through to the basement - I promise we won’t
keep her very long.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting
to the ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Do you like ice cream, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: I thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: You folks don’t mind if I give Danny some
ice cream, while we’re waiting for you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No, we don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Sound good to you, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay. You behave yourself.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Now what kind of ice cream do you like
Doc?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Chocolate it shall be. Come on son.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s amazing how much activity is going on
today.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Yes, well the guests and some of the staff
left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants
to be on their way as early as possible.</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: By five o’clock tonight, you’ll never know
anybody was ever here.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Just like a ghost ship, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ullman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Do you know how I knew your name was
Doc?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: You know what I’m talking about, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: I can remember when I was a little boy, my
grandmother and I could hold conversations entirely without ever opening
our mouths. She called it shining,</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: and for a long time I thought it was just
the two of us that had the shine to us.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Just like you probably thought you was the
only one. But there are other folks, though mostly they don’t know it,
or don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: How long have you been able to do it?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Why don’t you want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Who says you ain’t supposed to?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tony.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Who’s Tony?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tony’s the little boy who lives in my
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Is Tony the one that tells you things?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: How does he tell you things?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s like I go to sleep, and he shows me
things but when I wake up, I can’t remember everything.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Do they know he tell you things?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Has Tony ever told you anything about this
place? About the Overlook Hotel?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Now think real hard, Doc. Think.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Maybe he showed me something.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Try to think what it was.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mr. Halloran, are you scared of this
place?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: No, I’m scared of nothing here. It’s just
that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don’t. I
guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it
that’s like shining.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Is there something bad here?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well, you know Doc, when something happens
it can leave a trace of itself behind… say like is someone burns
toast.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well, maybe things that happened… leave
other kinds of traces behind.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Not things that anyone can notice, but
things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that
haven’t happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened
a long time ago… I think a lot of things happened right here in this
particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about Room 237?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Room 237?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re scared of Room 237, ain’tcha?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: No I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Nothing. There ain’t nothing in Room 237,
but you ain’t got no business going in there anyway, so stay out! You
understand, stay out!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is
ready.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s about eleven thirty.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Eleven thirty - Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I guess we’ve been staying up too late.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I made ’em just the way you like ’em, sunny
side up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hmm, nice.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s really pretty outside. How about taking
me for a walk after you’ve finished your breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing
first.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Any ideas yet?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Lots of ideas. No good ones.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, something’ll come. It’s just a matter
of settling back into the habit of writing every day.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah… that’s all it is.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s really nice up here, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I love it. I really do. I’ve never been this
happy, or comfortable anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah. It’s amazing how fast you get used to
such a big place. I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it
was kinda scarey.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I fell in love with it right away. When I came
up here from my interview, it was as though I had been here before.
We…we all have moments of deja vu, but this was ridiculous. It was
almost as though I knew what was going to be around every corner.
Ooohhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: The loser has to keep American clean, how’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: And you’re gonna lose. And I’m gonna get you
- you betta run fast! Look out - I’m coming in close. All right?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’ll have to keep America clean.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay Danny, you win. Let’s take the rest of
this walking, huh?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay…oh!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Give me your hand. Oh, isn’t it
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Here’s a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh what a Maze. Isn’t it beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s so pretty.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I didn’t think it was going to be this big,
did you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>woman announcer</strong>: Rutherford was serving a life
sentence for his conviction in the 1968 shooting and the search
continues in the mountains near Uray today for that missing Aspen
woman,</p>
<p><strong>woman announcer</strong>: twenty-four year old Susan
Robertson has been missing ten days. She disappeared while on a hunting
trip with her husband. They have good weather right now, but they may
have to call off the search if the predicted snowstorm moves in
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>woman announcer</strong>: But it’s so beautiful here in
Denver today, it’s hard to believe a snowstorm could be that close.</p>
<p><strong>man announcer</strong>: I know. I want to go outside and lie
in the sun. Yet to our north, to our west, it is snowing and cold, and
it’s moving</p>
<p><strong>man announcer</strong>: right here towards Colorado, right
now as we talk. It’s incredible.</p>
<p><strong>woman announcer</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi, hon. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Get a lot written today?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey, the weather forecast said it’s going to
snow tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you want me to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Ah, come on hon. Don’t be so grouchy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not being grouchy. I just want to finish
my work.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay. I understand. I’ll come back later on
with a couple of sandwiches for you and… maybe you’ll let me read
something then.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy, let me explain something to you.
Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you’re breaking my
concentration.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: you’re distracting me,</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: and it will then take me time to get back to
where I was, understand?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine. Now we’re going to make a new rule.
Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: or whether you don’t hear me typing, whatever
the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I
am working - that means don’t come in. Now do you think you can handle
that?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine. Why don’t you start right now and get
the fuck out of here, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I know you’ve got some.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: KDK 12 to KDK 1.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: This is KDK 1. We’re receiving you.
Over.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi. This is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook
Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Hi. How are you folks getting on up there?
Over.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh we’re just fine, but our telephones don’t
seem to be doing too well. Are the lines down by any chance? Over.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Yes. Quite a few of them are down, due to
the storm. Over.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Any chance of them being repaired soon?
Over.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t like to say. Most winters
they stay that way until spring. Over.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Boy, this storm is really something, isn’t
it? Over.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Oh yes. It’s one of the worst we’ve had for
years. Is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
Over.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I suppose not. Over.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Well, if you folks have any problems up
there just give us a call, and Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: I think it might be a good idea if you leave
your radio on all the time now. Over.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay. We’ll do that. It was real nice talking
to you. Bye. Over and Out.</p>
<p><strong>grady girls</strong>: Hullo, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>grady girls</strong>: Come and play with us.</p>
<p><strong>grady girls</strong>: Come and play with us, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>grady girls</strong>: For ever…</p>
<p><strong>grady girls</strong>: … and ever…</p>
<p><strong>grady girls</strong>: …and ever.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tony, I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Remember what Mr. Halloran said. It’s just
like pictures in a book, Danny. It isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Please let me give you some money.</p>
<p><strong>hermie</strong>: Oh I wouldn’t think of it.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well how can I repay you?</p>
<p><strong>hermie</strong>: It’s okay, really.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well I’m going to have some coffee. Would
you like some?</p>
<p><strong>hermie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Great. Sit down. Oh these marvellous
doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can I go to my room and get my
fire-engine?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Not right now, Daddy’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I won’t make any noise.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours
ago. Can’t you wait till later?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I won’t make a sound, I promise. I’ll
tip-toe.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well all right. But really don’t make a
sound.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I won’t, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Make sure you come right back, ’cause I’m
going to make lunch soon. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can I go to my room and get my
fire-engine?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come here for a minute, first.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How’s it going, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you having a good time?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good. I want you to have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I am, Dad. Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do you feel bad?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. I’m just a little tired.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then why don’t you go to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t. I have too much to do.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do you like this hotel?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes I do. I love it. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we
could stay here for ever, and ever… ever.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You wouldn’t ever hurt Mummy and me, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did your mother ever say that to you - that I
would hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I love you, Danny. I love you more than
anything else in the whole world, and I’d never do anything to hurt you,
never… You know that, don’t you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mom, are you in there?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack… Jack…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack, honey, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What happened, honey? Hon? What’s wrong?
Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I had… I had the most terrible nightmare I
ever had. It’s the most horrible dream I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s okay. It’s okay, now. Really.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I dreamed that I… that I killed you and
Danny.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But I didn’t just kill you, I cut you up into
little pieces.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My God, I must be losing my mind!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Every…everything is just going to be all
right. Come on. Here let’s get up off the floor.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny! Everything’s okay… Just go play in
your room for a while. Your Dad’s just got a headache. Danny - mind what
I say. Go play in your room!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hon, let me just go and get him out of here.
I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny, why don’t you mind me - huh?
Danny.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh my God! Danny what happened to your neck?
Danny…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: what happened to your neck, huh?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You did this to him, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You son of a bitch! You did this to him,</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: How could you? How could you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: God, I’d give anything for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My goddam soul, just a glass of beer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A little slow tonight, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now I’m awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd,
because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my
wallet. I was afraid they were going to be there until next April. So
here’s what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice. You
can do that, can’t you, Lloyd? You’re not to busy, are you?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No, sir. I’m not busy at all.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You set them up, and I’ll knock them back,
Lloyd, one by one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: White man’s burden, Lloyd my man. White man’s
burden.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Say, Lloyd, it seems I’m temporarily
light.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How’s my credit in this joint anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Your credit’s fine, Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always
liked you. You were always the best of them.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to
Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Thank you for saying so.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here’s to five miserable months on the wagon
and all the irreparable harm that it’s caused me.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: How are things going, Mr. Torrance?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be
a whole lot better.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I hope it’s nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just a little problem with the… old sperm bank
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing that I can’t handle though, Lloyd.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Women! Can’t live with ’em. Can’t live
without ’em!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Words of wisdom, Lloyd. Words of wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I haven’t laid a hand on him. Goddam it, I
didn’t. I wouldn’t touch one hair of his goddam little head. I love the
little son-of-a- bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’d do anything for him. Any fucking thing for
him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That damn bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: As long as I live she’ll never let me forget
what happened!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I did hurt him once, okay? It was an accident,
complete unintentional. It could have happened to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And it was three goddam years ago. The little
fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor. All I tried to do
was to pull him up. A momentary loss of muscular coordination. I mean… A
few extra foot pounds of energy, per second… per second.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh Jack! Thank God you’re here.</p>
<p>****: Jack,</p>
<p>****: Jack, there’s someone else in the hotel with us. There’s a
crazy woman in one of the rooms. She tried to strangle Danny.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you out of your fucking mind?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No. It’s the truth, really. I swear it. Danny
told me. He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he
saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub. She tried to strangle him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Which room was it?</p>
<p><strong>disc jockey</strong>: From Channel 10 in Miami, this is
Newswatch - with Glen Rinker and Bishop, and the award winning Newswatch
team.</p>
<p><strong>glen rinker</strong>: Good evening. I’m Glen Rinker Newswatch
10. While Miami continues to swelter in a record winter heatwave
bringing temperatures to the mid and upper nineties, the Central and
Rocky Mountain States are buried in snow.</p>
<p><strong>glen rinker</strong>: In Colorado ten inches of snow has
fallen in just a few hours tonight. Travel in the Rockies is almost
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>glen rinker</strong>: Airports are shut down stranding
thousands of passengers. Highways are blocked by snowdrifts. Railroad
tracks are frozen. Officials in Colorado tell Newswatch at least three
people have been killed by exposure to freezing winds. The Governor of
Colorado is expected tomorrow to declare a weather emergency. The
National Guard might be called out to clear streets and roads. Weather
forecasters predict more snow and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow, with
temperatures dropping well below zero.</p>
<p><strong>glen rinker</strong>: Back here in South Florida, we’ve got
just the opposite problem; the heat and humidity are supposed to
climb.</p>
<p><strong>glen rinker</strong>: Local beaches should be jammed. Our
weather expert Walter Cronice will have the local forecast later on.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: We are sorry your call cannot be completed
as dialed. If you need assistance, please call the operator.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh, thank God!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Did you find anything?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t see one goddam thing.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You went into the room Danny said - to
237?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: And you didn’t see anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Absolutely nothing. How is he?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: He’s still asleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sure he’ll be himself again in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, are you sure it was the right room? I
mean, maybe Danny made a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He must have gone into that room - the door
was open and the lights were on.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh, I just don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well what about those bruises on his
neck?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Somebody did that to him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think he did it to himself.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No! No, that’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy, once you rule out his version of what
happened, there is no other explanation - is there? It wouldn’t be that
different from the episode that he had before we came up here, would
it?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack, whatever the explanation is,</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I think we have to get Danny out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get him out of here?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You mean just leave the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It is so fucking typical of you to create a
problem like this when I finally have a chance to accomplish something.
When I’m really into my work. I could really write my own ticket if I
went back to Boulder now, couldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash
- any of that appeal to you?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far,
but I’m not going to let you fuck this up!</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Good evening. Forest Service.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Hallo. My name’s Dick Halloran. I’m the
Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do
for you?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Sir, I’ve been trying to make an urgent
phone call up there,</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: but the operator said that the phone lines
are down.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Yes, I’m afraid a lot of lines around here
are down, due to the storm.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well, look sir, I hate to put you to any
trouble, but there’s a family up there all by themselves with a young
kid, and with this storm and everything.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: I’d sure appreciate it if you’d give them
a call on your radio just to see if everything is okay.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: I’d be glad to do that, sir. Oh why don’t
you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Thank you very much. I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: All right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi Lloyd. I’ve been away. Now I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Good evening Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It’s good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s good to be back, Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: What’ll it be, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hair of the dog that big me.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Bourbon on the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’ll do her.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No charge?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Your money’s no good here.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Orders from the house.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Orders from the house.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Drink up, Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m the kind of man likes to know who’s buying
their drinks, Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It’s not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anything you say, Lloyd. Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh dear, oh dear. I’m so sorry, sir. Oh!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh dear oh dear… I’ve made an awful mess of
your jacket, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh eh that’s all right. I’ve got plenty of
jackets.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m afraid it’s advocaat sir. It tends to
stain.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Advocaat is it?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes sir. Look um… I think the best thing is
to come along to the gentlemen’s room, sir, and eh…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: we’ll get some water to it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Looks as though you might have got a spot of
it on yourself there, Jeevesy old boy.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That doesn’t matter, sir. You’re the
important one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Awfully nice of you to say. Of course I intend
to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Very wise, sir. Very wise.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here, I’ll just, eh…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: hold this for you there, Jeevesy.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Thank you, sir. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Now let’s see if we can improve this with a
little water, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right, I’ll just set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Won’t keep you a moment, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do they call you around here,
Jeevesy?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Delbert Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Eh, Mr. Grady…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: haven’t I seen you somewhere before?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Why no, sir. I don’t believe so.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ah ha, it’s coming off now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Eh… Mr. Grady… weren’t you once the caretaker
here?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Why no, sir. I don’t believe so.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You er a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes, sir. I have a wife and eh two daughters,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And, er… where are they now?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh, they’re somewhere around. I’m not quite
sure at the moment, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker here. I
recognize you. I saw your picture in the newspapers. You eh… chopped
your wife and daughters up into little bits, and eh… and you blew your
brains out.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s strange, sir. I don’t have any
recollection of that at all. Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m sorry to differ with you, sir, but you
are the caretaker. You have always been the caretaker, I should know,
sir. I’ve always been here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Did you know, Mr. Torrance, that your son… is
attempting to bring an outside party into this situation? Did you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He is, Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: A nigger.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A nigger!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: A nigger cook.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Your son has a very great talent. I don’t
think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that
very talent against your will.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, he is a very willful boy.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Indeed, he is, Mr. Torrance. A very willful
boy. A rather naughty boy, if I may be so bold, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s his mother.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She eh… interferes.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you
don’t mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: My girls, sir, they didn’t care for the
Overlook at first. One of them actually stole a packet of matches</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: and tried to burn it down. But I corrected
them, sir. And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty I
corrected her.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: We have the Snowcat. If the weather breaks,
we might just be able to get down the mountain in that.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I could call the Forest Rangers first and
then tell them that we’re coming so that they could start searching for
us, in case we didn’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: If Jack won’t come with us, we’ll just have
to tell him that we are going by ourselves. That’s all there is to
it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Red Rum. Red Rum.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Red Rum. Red Rum.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Red Rum.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny… what’s the matter, hon?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Red Rum.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Are you having a bad dream?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny? Hon?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Danny’s not here, Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Come on, hon, wake up. You just had a bad
dream. Everything’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Danny can’t wake up, Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny, wake up! Come on, right now,</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Danny’s gone away, Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Danny…</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12. KDK 1 calling
KDK 12. Are you receiving me? This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12. KDK 1
calling KDK 12. Do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12. KDK 1 calling
KDK 12. Are you receiving me?</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: KDK 1 calling KDK 12. KDK 1 calling KDK 12.
Do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12. KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Are you recei…</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Good evening. Forest Service.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I
called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Oh yeah. We tried to contract them several
times by radio, but they didn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Now, maybe they’ve got their radio turned
off or they’re in a place where they can’t hear it. If you like me to,
I’d be glad to try them again later on.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Oh, that’s very nice of you. I’ll call you
back later. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Pardon me, miss. What time will we get to
Denver?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: We’re due to arrive at 8:20, sir.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: Durkin’s garage.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Hello, can I speak to Larry?</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: Speaking.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Hello Larry. This is Dick, Dick
Halloran.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: Dick, how are you doing? How’s the weather
down there?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: I’m not in Florida, Larry. I’m calling
from Stapleton Airport.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: What the hell are you doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Well, I just got in from Miami, and I’ve
got to get up to the Overlook today. What’s the weather like up
there?</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: Well, the snow ploughs are keeping things
moving in town, but the mountain roads are completely blocked.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: That means I’m going to need a snowcat to
get up there, Larry. Can you fix me up with one?</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: What’s the big deal about getting up there
today, especially in this kind of weather?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Larry, just between you and me, we’ve got
a very serious problem with the people who are taking care of the place.
They’ve turned out to be completely unreliable assholes. Ullman phoned
me last night, and I’m supposed to go up there and find out if they have
to be replaced.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: How long is it going to take you to get up
here?</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Oh about five hours. I’m gonna rent a car
here at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: Okay, Dick - I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>halloran</strong>: Oh thanks a lot, Larry. I really
appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: That’s all right. Drive carefully.</p>
<p><strong>voice over radio</strong>: Well, good morning to you, Hal and
Charlie on Radio 63, KHOW Denver</p>
<p><strong>voice over radio</strong>: and, Charlie, we have what you
call your bad day out there. What you call your heavy snow, snowing hard
throughout the eh Denver metro area. Many of the mountain passes - Wolf
Creek, and Red Mountain passes are already closed…</p>
<p><strong>voice over radio</strong>: and the chain law is in effect
right now at the Eisenhower Tunnel. I guess as we’ve just heard from the
news forecast, Charlie, a few of the flights are still landing out at
Stapleton International Airport, and, with these early storms like this,
I guess the entire airport will probably be closed within the hour.
Yeah, they’re just not prepared. The storm will continue throughout the
day, and the national weather service… has declared a stopmans and
travelers advisory… for all areas outlying the Denver metro region - get
the cows in the barn. There you go. Many businesses…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hon,</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: …listen to me for a minute, will you,
hon?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m just going to go and talk to Daddy for a
few minutes and I’ll be right back. I want you to just stay here and
watch your cartoons, okay?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay, hon?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: All right. Now I’ll be back in just about
five minutes. I’m gonna lock the door behind me.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack…?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing down here?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I just eh… wanted…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: …to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. Let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I can’t really remember.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe it was about Danny. Maybe it was about
him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think we should discuss Danny.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think… we should discuss what should be done
with him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What should be done with him?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t think that’s true. I think you have
some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny… and I’d
like to know what they are.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well I… I think maybe he should be taken to a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You think maybe he should be taken to a
doctor?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When do you think maybe he should be taken to
a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: As soon as possible?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: As soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: …please…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You believe his health might be at stake?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Ye…yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And you are concerned about him?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And are you concerned about me?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Of course I am.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course you are.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Have you ever thought about my
responsibilities?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh Jack, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Have you ever had a single moment’s thought
about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary
moment about my responsibilities to my employers?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed
to look after the Overlook Hotel until May the first? Does it matter to
you at all that the owners have placed their complete confidence and
trust in me, and that I have signed a letter of agreement, a contract,
in which I have accepted that responsibility?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you have the slightest idea what a moral
and ethical principal is? Do you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Has it ever occurred to you what would happen
to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Has it ever occurred to you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Has it?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I just want to go back to my room.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well… I’m very confused, and I just need a
chance to think things over.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ve had your whole fucking life to think
things over - what’s good a few minutes more going to do you now?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack… stay away from me… please.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Don’t hurt me! Don’t hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me,</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away…!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Darling, light of my life, I’m not going to
hurt you. You didn’t let me finish my sentence. I said ‘I’m not going to
hurt you… I’m just going to bash your brains in!’ I’m going to bash them
right the fuck in.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me! Please…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stop swinging the bat.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Put the bat down, Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy give me the bat.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay… stay away!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me the bat.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me the bat.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Jack, stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stop swinging the bat.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Get down.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me the bat.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Go away from me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me the bat.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me the bat.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Goddamn!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh…oh!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey… what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ohhh… what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, wait a minute… What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Goddamit! Let me out of here! Open the goddam
door.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy, listen. Let me out of here and I’ll
forget the whole goddam thing. It’ll be just like nothing ever
happened.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy, baby…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think you hurt my head real bad.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m dizzy. I need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Honey… don’t leave me in here.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m gonna go now -</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m going to try and get… get Danny down to
the Sidewinder… in the Snowcat today.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’ll bring back a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m gonna go now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ve got a big surprise coming to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go check out the Snowcat and the radio and see
what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go check it out!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go check it out!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go check it out!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wendy?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s Grady, Mr. Torrance. Delbert Grady.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Grady… oh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh Grady… right. Grady… er…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hullo Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Mr. Torrance, I see you can hardly have taken
care of the…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: business we discussed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I’ll deal
with that situation as soon as I get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I wonder. I have my doubts.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I and others have come to believe… that your
heart is not in this, that you haven’t the belly for it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just give me one more chance to prove it,
Mr. Grady. That’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Your wife appears to be stronger than we
imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got
the better of you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I fear that you will have to deal with this
matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance. I fear that is the
only thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s nothing I look forward to with the
greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You give your word on that do you,
Mr. Torrance?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I give you my word.</p>
<p><strong>tony’s voice</strong>: Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red
Rum.</p>
<p><strong>tony’s voice</strong>: Red Rum.</p>
<p><strong>tony’s voice</strong>: Red Rum.</p>
