<h1 id="withnail-and-i">withnail-and-i</h1>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m having a cup of tea, do you want one?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Do you want a cup of tea Withnail!? No.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I don’t want to hear it. I don’t want to hear
anything. Oh God, it’s a nightmare out there I tell you. We’ve just run
out of wine what are we going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t feel good.
Look! My thumbs have gone weird. I’m in the middle of a fucking
overdose. My hearts beating like a fucked clock. I feel dreadful, I feel
fucking dreadful. So do I. So does everyone. Look at my tongue. A grey
yellow sock. Sit down for Christ’s sake, what’s the matter with you? Eat
some sugar.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Where’s the coffee? “In a world exclusive
interview 33 year old shot putter Geoff Woade who weight 317 pounds,
admitted taking massive doses of anabolic steroids, drugs banned in
sport. It used to get him bad tempered and act down said his wife. He
used to pick on me. But now he’s stopped his much better in our sex life
and in our general life.”</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Please! I don’t feel good. That’s what you’d say
but that wouldn’t wash with Geoff. No! He’d like a bit of pleading. Add
spice to it. In fact, he’d probably tell you what he was going to do
before he did it. “I’m going to pull you head off”. “Oh no, please,
don’t pull my head off”. “I’m going to pull your head off because I
don’t like your head!”</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Coffee Why don’t you use a cup like any other
human being?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Why don’t you wash up occasionally like any
other human being? How dare you!? How dare you!? How dare you call me
inhumane!?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I didn’t call you inhumane, you merely imagined
it. Calm down. Right you fucker - I’m going to do the washing up!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No no you can’t. It’s impossible I swear it.
I’ve looked into in. Listen to me listen to me. There are things in
there, there’s a tea-bag growing. You haven’t slept in sixty hours
you’re in no state to tackle it. Wait till the morning we’ll go in
together. This is the morning. Stand aside!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You don’t understand. I think there may be
something alive. What do you mean? a rat?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: It’s possible, it’s possible. Then the fucker
will rue the day!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I told you. you’ve been bitten! Burnt, burnt,
the fucking kettle’s on fire.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: There’s something floating up. Fork it!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No no no, I don’t want to touch it. You must you
must. The poop will boil through the glaze. We’ll never</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me the gloves.
That’s right, put on the gloves. Don’t attempt anything without the
gloves.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Matter. Matter? Where’s it coming from?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Don’t look. Don’t look. I’m dealing with it! I
think we’ve been in here too long. I feel unusual. I think we should</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: It’ll get better, it has to. Easy for you to say
lovey. You’ve had an audition. Why can’t I have an audition. It’s
ridiculous: I’ve been to drama school. I’m good looking. I tell you,
I’ve a fuck sight more talent that half the rubbish that gets of TV. Why
can’t I get on TV?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Well I don’t know. It’ll happen. Will it? That’s
what you say. The only programme I’m likely to get on is the fucking
news. I tell you, I can’t take much more of this. I’m going to
crack.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m in the same boat. Yeah, yeah. I feel as sick
as a pike. I’m going to have to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You know what we should do? I say, you know what
we should do? How should I possibly know what we should do? What should
we do?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Get out of it for a while. Get into the
countryside. Rejuvenate. Rejuvenate! I’m in a park and I’m practically
dead. What good’s the countryside? What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: It’s eight. Fours hours to opening time. God
help us. Have we got any embrocation?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What for? To rub on ourselves you fool. We’ll
cover ourselves in deep heat and get up against a radiator. Keep
ourselves alive until twelve.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Why don’t you ask your father for some money. If
we had some money we Why don’t you ask your father. How can it be so
cold in here. It’s</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What happened to your cigar commercial? That’s
what I want to know. what happened to my cigar commercial. What</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: September. Bad patch. Rubbish. Haven’t seen
Gylgod down the labour exchange. Why doesn’t he</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What are you talking about? The thermostats.
what have you done to them?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I haven’t touched them. Then why has my head
gone numb. I must have some booze. I demand to have some booze.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Because I don’t advise it. Even the wankers on
the site wouldn’t drink that. That’s worse than meths. Nonsense, this is
a far superior drink to meths. The wankers don’t drink it because they
can’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No we have nothing. Sit down! Liar, you’ve got
antifreeze.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You bloody fool. You should never mix your
drinks! ———————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Perfume on my boots. I had to scrub the with
essence of petunia.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: If my father was loaded I’d ask him for some
money. If your father was my father you wouldn’t get it. : There you are
lads. Chin chin.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Ugh. What about what-his-name? What about
him?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Why don’t you give him a call. What for?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Ask him about his house. You want me to call
what-his-name and ask him about his house?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Why not? Alright. what’s his number?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’ve no idea - I’ve never met him. Well neither
have I. What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Your relative with a house in the country.
Monty? Uncle Monty?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: That’s him. That’s the one. Get the Jag fixed
up. Spend the weekend in the country. Alright. Give us a tenner and I’ll
give him a bell.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Get a couple more in. I’m going for a slash.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Balls to Monty we’re getting out. Balls to
Monty!? I’ve just spent an hour flattering the bugger.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: There’s a man over there doesn’t like the
perfume. The big one. Don’t look, don’t look. We’re in danger, we’ve got
to get out. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’ve been called a ponce.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Speed is like a dozen transatlantic flights
without ever getting off the plane. Timechange. You lose, you gain.
Makes no difference so long as you keep taking the pills. But sooner or
later you’ve got to get out because it’s crashing then all at once the
frozen hours melt out through the nervous system and seep out the
pores.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Why are we having lunch in here? It’s dinner and
Danny’s here.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Danny!? How did he get in? I let him in this
morning. He lost one of his clogs. He’s come in because of the perpetual
cold. I hope the buggers sales plummet.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’ve got your savaloy. Here. I don’t want it.
Then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Don’t vent spleen on me. I’m in the same boat.
Stop saying that. You’re not in the same boat. The only thing you’re in
that I’ve been in is this fucking bath.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Danny’s here. Head hunter to his friends. Head
hunter to everybody. He doesn’t have any friends. The only people he
converses with are his clients and occasionally the police. The purveyor
of rare herbs and prescribed chemicals is back. Will we never be set
free? ———————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Danny. You’re looking very beautiful man. Have
you been away? St. Peter preached the epistles to the apostles looking
like that. Have you got any food.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Mmm, As a matter of fact, got a savaloy. How
much is it?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You can have it for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: That’s alright Danny. We’d decided to lay off
for a bit. That’s what I thought. Except for personal use I concur with
you. as a matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into
business Doing what? The toy industry.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No. Then why’s he wearing that old suit? Old
suit? This suit was cut by Hawke’s of Saville row. Just because the best
tailoring you’ve ever seen is above you fucking appendix doesn’t mean
anything. Don’t get uptight with me man. Because if you do I’ll have to
give you a dose of medicine and if I spike you you’ll know you’ve been
spoken to. You wouldn’t spike me you’re too mean. Besides, there’s
nothing invented I couldn’t take. If I medicined you you’d think a brain
tumour was a birthday present. I could take double anything you could.
Very, very foolish words man.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: He’s right Withnail. Look at him . His
mechanisms gone. He’s had more drugs than you’ve had hot dinners. I’m
not having this shag-sack insulting me. Let him get his drugs out.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: That’s sense Withnail. You can stuff it up your
arse for nothing and fuck off while you’re doing it. No need to insult
me man. I was leaving anyway. Have either of you got shoes?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Sherry. Sherry.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What’s all this. The man’s mad. Eccentric.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Eccentric? He’s insane. Not only that he’s a
raving homosexual.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: He’s a madman. Any moment now he’s going to rush
out and get into his tights. Ok ok. Give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: The house or out.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, I wish I could. It’s just thoughts really.
Have you published?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No no. Where did you school? He went to the
other place Monte. Oh you went to Eton?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What’s all this going off in private business?
Why did you tell him I went to Eton? Because it wouldn’t have helped if
I hadn’t.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What do you mean by that? Free to those that can
afford it. Very expensive to those that can’t.
———————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Shut up. Little tarts they love it.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Listen, I’m trying to drive this thing as
quietly as possible. If you don’t shut up we’ll get stopped by the
police.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What do you want a child for? To tutor it in the
ways of righteousness and procure some uncontaminated urine.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, we’re not we’re here and we’re in the middle
of a fucking gale. Now you’ll have to keep a look out your side. If you
see anything tell me. Get hold of that map. Where’s the whisky?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What for? I’ve got a bastard behind the eyes. I
can’t take aspirins without a drink. Where’s the aspirin?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Probably in the bathroom. You mean we’ve come
out here in the middle of fucking nowhere without aspirins?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Where are we? How should i know where we are. I
feel like a pig shat in my head.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Now get hold of that map and look for a place
called Crow Crag.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Give me the key and get out of the way. If I
don’t get aspirin I shall die here on this fucking mountainside.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Monty!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What are you doing? Sitting down to enjoy my
holiday</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Right, now we’re going to have to approach this
scientifically. First thing we’ve got to do is get this fire alight,
then we split into two fact finding groups. I’ll deal with the water and
the plumbings, you check the fuel and wood situation.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What’s that? The fuel and wood situation.
There’s nothing out there except a hurricane. This place is
uninhabitable.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Give it a chance. It’s got to warm up Warm up!?
We may as well sit round a cigarette. This is ridiculous. We’ll be found
dead in here next spring.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Well we’ve got enough furniture for tonight.
Tomorrow we get down that farm and get some logs. This is a mistake I
tell you. This is a dreadful mistake.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Me!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m a friend of Montague Withnail. He’s lent us
his cottage. I wondered if you could sell us some food. Eggs and
things.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What about wood and coal?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m not from London you know! I don’t care where
you come from.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Not the attitude I’d been given to expect from
the H E Bates novel I’d read. I thought they’d all be out the back
drinking cider, discussing butter. Clearly a myth. Evidently country
people and no more receptive to strangers than city dwellers.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Do you think you could tell me where I could buy
some coal and wood? You’ll have to see my son. He runs this farm.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Where is you son? Up in top field. You can’t
miss him, his legs bound in polythyne.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Withnail you bastard wake up.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Oye, wake up you bastard you’ve got to get
wood.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I tried to get fuel and wood, there’s a
miserable little pensioner down there wouldn’t give it me. Where are we
going to get it then?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: There’s a man up on the mountain. Why he’s up
there, fuck knows, but he’s up there with a leg bound in polythene, you
can’t miss him, he’s your man. And have another look in that shed. Find
anything. If you can’t find anything, bring in the shed.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: How come Monty owns such a horrible little
shack? No idea.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You never discuss your family do you? I fail to
see my family’s of any interest to you. I’ve absolutely no interest in
yours. I dislike relatives in general and in particular mine.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Why? I’ve told you why. We’re incompatible. They
don’t like me being on stage.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Then they must be delighted with your career.
What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You rarely are.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Then get after it. That’s the man.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Stop Stop</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Stop please!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Stop saying that Withnail, of course he’s the
fucking farmer. We’re friends of Montague Withnail, we desperately need
fuel and wood.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Montegue Withnail, you must know him. Fat man,
owns the cottage. Ay, seen the fat man. London type. Queer sort. Think
his name’s French or something. French!? Ay, Adrian de la Touche. He
hasn’t been up year for couple of years. Last time I saw him, he were;
he were with his son.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Yeah, that’s him. Listen, we’re bona fide. We’re
not from London. Could we have some fuel and wood? Ay, I could bring you
up some logs later but I’ve got the cows and that to feed first.
When?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Shut up. That would be very kind of you. Erm,
what about food? Do you think you could sell us something to eat? I
could bring you up a chicken but you’ll have to go to the village
really.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: That would be very kind of you Mr? Parkin</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Mr Parkin. What happened to your leg? Got a
randy bull up there. Give me one in knee!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You want to get out the back don’t you? Get some
spuds up. Sorry I can’t. My boots are in the oven</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You’d go if you had boots? Gladly</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Great. How much do we own you? Pay us when you
come down</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What about this chicken? ’s on back</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Oye! Oye! Parkin’s been. There’s the supper!
What are we supposed to do with that?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Eat it Eat it!? Fucker’s alive</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Yeah, you’ve got to kill it. Me!? I’m the
firelighter and fuel collecter.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Yeah I know but I got the logs in. It takes away
your appitite just looking at it. No it doesn’t I’m starving. How can we
make it die?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You’ve got to throttle them. Withnail, I think
you ought to kill it instantly in case it starts trying to make friends
with us. Alright, you get hold of ir. I’ll strangle it.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I can’t. Those dreadful, beady eyes! They stare
you out! It’s a bloody chicken. Just think of it with bacon across its
back! Right, I’ll deal with this. You’ll have to get its guts out.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Never point guns at people. Extremely dangerous.
Now what about this roasting dish? What are we going to cook it in?
You’re the food and plummings man. I’ve no idea. I wish I’d found this
an hour ago. I’d have taken great pleasure in gunning this pullet
down.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No it shouldn’t. Right, we’re going to have to
reverse the roles. We can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this
bastard over the fire.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, it’s going to need it’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Straddle them either side of that.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: With respect to what? I’m thinking of changing
my name.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Too like Donald Woolfe</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Here, changeover point.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No I suppose happiness is relative. I never
thought it would be a polythene bag without the hole in it.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What’s up with him? Shut that gate, shut that
bull!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You didn’t shut the gate! Shut that gate, shut
that bull!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Well that can’t be sensible can it? The
bastard’s about to run at me Well he’s randy!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I know he is</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Shut up Withnail! Just run at it, shouting! Do
as he says, start shouting. It won’t gore you</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: A coward you are Withnail. An expert on bulls
you are not!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What’s all this army bollocks? We got a drink
didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I think he means it</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Ask him if we can have one What for?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: So that we can eat it! ‘We’re fed up with
stew’</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Ask him if we can have one of those. Go on.
Excuse me, we were wondering if we could purchase a pheasant off of you
No. Come on old boy. What’s in your hump? Those pheasants are for his
pot. There eels are for my pot. Now what makes you think I should give
you something for your pot? What pot?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Our cooking pot. Ah, he know. Here, give us a
wheeze on that fag.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: There’s black pudding in it. Black puddings are
no good to us. I want somethings flesh! ———————————————————————- I think
I’ll call myself Donald Twain. Get down, get down. It’s him, what does
he want?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Better get down there and ask him. Don’t be
ridiculous, he’s got a gun. Bastard’s phycotic, you’ve only got to look
at him. ———————————————————————- this place has become impossible.
Nothing to eat, freezing cold and now a madman on the prowl outside with
eels.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: alright you’ve made your point. we pack up
tomorrow and get out. where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m going for a slash you can’t go outside, i
can’t get my boots on when they’re hot.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: then i’ll go alone no you won’t these are the
sort of windows faces look in at.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: alright then i won’t have a slash and in both
our interests i think we should sleep together tonight.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: don’t be ridiculous he;s not going to come up
here in the dark. yes he is and if he catches one of us off guard he’s
got a much better chance of dealing with the other.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: no ———————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: ha ha ha ha ha what are you laughing about</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: i was dreaming you frightened the piss out of
me. move over</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: will you get out no</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: alright, i’ll have to sleep in your bed then
i’ll have to come with you</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: alright you can stay but the gun goes no, i have
to keep the gun . i intend to stay awake until morning.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: it’s my bed and i demand presidence. mad fucking

<p><strong>i:</strong>: ah ah. what. i heard a noise.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: there is nothing get to bed. what was that?

<p><strong>i:</strong>: probably just foxes. perhaps its the farmer at
two in the morning? it’s the killer. he’s come to kill us. it’s all your
fault, you’ve even given him the fucking gun. I’ve got to get in. He’s
trying to get in.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: He can’t, he’ll go away. He’s going away. He’s
getting in thorough the window. He’s sharpening the fucking knife</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: where’s the matches? in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: alright. we’ll have to tackle with him. you stay
in bed and pretend to be asleep. when he goes for you i’ll jump on his
back. no no, it’ll be too late by then, i’ll be knifed. we’ll have to
try and make friends with him. He’s going to your room. it’s you he
wants. offer him yourself! we mean no harm. oh my boys, my boys.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: monty! monty monty! monty you terrible cunt.
what are you doing prowling round in the middle of the fucking night? i
had a punctured tyre. i had to wait an eon for assistance. i’m sorry if
i frightened you. i’ll sleep in the other room if i may</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: anywhere you like Monty
——————————————————————————- ah, good morning. did you sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: mmmm. you’ve been busy in here as a bee. I do
appologise for last night, it was perfectly inconsidereate of me.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: that’s perfectly alright monty. how did you
repair the window? didn’t break it. merely forced it a little. there was
an empty wine bottle on the ledge. tomatoes. you better wake him,
breakfast in fifteen minutes. ——————————————————————————- The older
order changeth giving way to the new and God forfills himself in many
ways and soon, I suppose, I shall be swept away by some vulgar little
tumor. My boys, we are at the end of an age. We live in a land of
weather forcasts and breakfasts that set in. Shat on by Tories,
shovelled up by labour. Now which of you is going to be a splendid
fellow and go down to the Rolls for the rest of the wine?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’ll go. I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, I’ll go - I need to see about digging the
car out. But we have my car dear boy.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Yes, but if it rains we’re buggered. I mean…
Stranded! Leave this to me</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’ll come with you, I could do with a walk.
Besides. I shall need you to work on the joint. I hear you’re a little
wizard in the kitchen. Yeah, you the food and plumbings expert. What on
earth are those? We forgot to bring our wellingtons. You mean you’ve
been up here in all this beastly mud and oomska without wellingtons?
This afternoon I’ll take you both into Penryth and get you fitted with
some good quality rubber boots. ——————————————————————————- The kitchen.
I brought two of these in case either of you were any good in the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m not. Oh, of course you are. Cooking’s one of
the natural talents. Garlic, rosemary and salt.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Look this is all very kind of you Monty but I
really ought to be out there getting some work done on the car. You
haven’t time we’re taking late luncheon at three.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: We’ll have to leave by three Monty. Didn’t he
tell you? We’ve got to get back to sign on. Sign on!? At a labour
exchange!?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Yes, it’s rather fashionable actually. All the
actors do it. Even Redgrave. Couldn’t you forgo for just this one
occasion? I’ve come a very long way to see you both.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Sorry can’t. I mean, I’d love to stay but he’s
more adament to get back than I am. Then we must choose our moment and
have a word with him. I’m sure together we could persuade him. Now,
garlic, rosemary and salt. I can never touch meat until it’s cooked. As
a youth I used to weep in butchers shops.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I can’t find the rosemary. Can’t find the
rosemary! I’m sure we could find it together.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: perhaps it’s in the other bag. Perhaps it is.
Shall we look? Sorry. Sherry’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What do you mean sorry!? What’s he doing here?
We can’t stay he won’t leave me alone. Alright, we’ll get the dinner
down then we’ll leave. I’m afraid we must drink from these. I hope their
shapes will not offend your palates. Chin chin. To a delightful weekend
in the country. ——————————————————————————- Penryth I do think you could
at least have shaved. What will people think, you look like a pair of
farm-hands. Get away from the car. Now, you get the wellingtons. I’m
going to but some razors and shaving soap. I’ll meet you here in half an
hour. Couple of blooms.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: One each. I think a drink don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What about the wellingtons? Oh, bollocks to the
wellingtons. We’ll tell him there was a farmer’s conference and they had
a run on them. ——————————————————————————- Inside the pub</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: yeah, ok then. yeah. promise.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Hasn’t heard a thing. They’re still seeing
people. You don’t want to go to Manchester anyway; play a bloody
soilder.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I don’t know if I do. Bloody good little theatre
that. It’s not much of a part is it. They’d make you cut you hair
off.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: So what, you’d loose a leg! BARMAN: time please
gents. Alright we’re going to have to work quickly. A pair of quadruple
whiskies and another pair of pints please. ——————————————————————————-
Where is he. Utterly aresholed.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: We’re early.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: We want to get in there don’t we. Eat some cake.
Soak up the booze. ——————————————————————————- Alright here? Miss B: No,
we’re closing in a minute. We’re leaving in a minute. Alright here? Miss
B: What do you want? We’ll have tea and cake. P: Did you hear her? She
said she’d closed. What do you want in here? Cake and tea. what’s it got
to do with you? P: I happen to be the proprietor. Now, will you leave?
Ah good, I’m glad you’re the proprietor. I was going to have to have a
word with you anyway. We’re doing a film up here, location see. We might
want to do a film in here. P: You’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Just bring out the cake. Cake and fine wine.
Miss B: If you don’t leave we’ll call the police. Balls. We want the
finest wines availible to humanity. We want them here and we want them
now. P: The police, Miss Blennerhassit.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Don’t do that Miss Blenerhassit. I’m warning you
Miss Blennerhassit, if you do - you’re fired. We are multi-millionaries.
we’ll buy this place and fire you immediately. Yeah, that’s right, we’ll
buy this place and install a fucking duke-box and liven all you stiffs
up a bit. P: The police Miss Blenerhassit. Just tell them there are a
couple of drunks in the Penryth tea rooms and we’d like them
removed.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: We are not drunks, we are multi-millionaires. P:
Come on Mabs, we’ll keep them here until they arrive You won’t keep us
anywhere. Miss B: Police please We’ll buy this place and have it knocked
down.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: It’s alright, ’s alright. Our car has arrived.
We’re coming back in here. ——————————————————————————- The cottage</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Where is he? Sulking up the hill. He says he
won’t come down for lunch without an appology.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Suits me, he can eat his fucking radish. It’s
all you fault.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I beg your pardon Monte. You lead him astray. Oh
don’t pretend you don’t understand, I know what you’re up to. Sherry?
Sherry!? Oh no, no, no, no. I’ll fall straight into his trap. He’s so
mauve we don’t know what he’ll do next. ——————————————————————————- the
kitchen I’m preparing myself to forgive you. I think you’ve been
punished enough. I think we better release you from the legume and
transfer you talents to the meat. You shouldn’t treat each other so
badly. He’s been working his fingers to the bone and all you do is sit
in here drinking. Now, he’s going to revitalize himself in here while
you finish the vegtables. I don’t know how to do them. Well of course
you don’t. You’re incapable of indulging in anything but pleasure am I
not right? You don’t deserve such loyalty. Now come along, I’m going to
teach you how to peel a potato. ——————————————————————————- the dinner
table It’s very stimulating getting back to a basic sort of lifestyle.
Without effecened emotion and poisonous inhibition.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Except the problem do tend to take the edge off
it. What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: There are no proper facilities All the glorious
trials of youth dear boy. When I was a lad I’d rocket off on my tandem
with Wrigglesworth and ride and ride. Find some old barn and fall asleep
with the sweet perfume of hay on our lips. Would it be in poor form to
plagarise a toast? It depend entirely on the quality of the wine. In
this case, it most certainly would not. In that case, to a delightful
weekend in the country. Oooh, we were expecting a volley of argument
concerning Mr Redgrave.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You’re forgetting Jake. Jake can wait too.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Jake’s not a friend Monte. I’d hoped to avoid
telling you this, but there’s a madman on the loose outside. Is this
true? Well, there’s this local type. Poacher. We got into a bit of a
tiff and he threatened me with a dead fish. Yes, it was rather amusing
acutally. When you came into the house we thought it was him and we
thought that you cleaning your boots was him sharpening the knife. Oh,
how delicious!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m going for a walk. Oh, wait for us dear boy,
we’ll all go. ——————————————————————————- Outside the cottage Look, I
know what your thinking but I had no alternative. The old beggers come a
long way and I didn’t want to put the wind up him.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You sensitivity overwhelms me. If you think
you’re having a weekends indulgence up here at his expense, which means
him having a weekends induldgence up here at my expense you’ve got
another thing coming. Anyway, he sent me out to say the coffee’s
ready.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I couldn’t drink it. I’ve got a crick in my
mouth from grinning. Well stop smilling at him.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I can’t help it, I’m so uptight with him.
——————————————————————————- The hillside. Longtemps, longtemps de teau
cheveux. Oh, Bodelair. Brings back such memories of Oxford. I followed
by yet another anecdote about his sensitive crimes in a punt with a chap
called Norman who had ref hair and a poetry book stained with the butter
drips from crumpets. Indeed I often wonder where Norman is now. Probably
wintering with his mother in Guilford, a cat, rain, vim under the sink
and both bars on. But old now, there is no true beauty without decay.
Legium pro Britania How right you are, how right you are. We live in a
kingdom of where royalty comes in gangs. Come on lads, the sky’s
bruising, night must fall and we shall be forced to camp.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: He’s having my room. I want the room with the
lock. Agree to that or I’m off. Alright, alright</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Good old Jake eh? And that’s precisely the
reason I’m off back to London. Come on, lets pack up and get off. Good
old Jake, eh Withnail. Lets all have a laugh. Good old Jake. He’s going
away. Here hare here. Here hare here! Good old Jake.
——————————————————————————- The cottage. Ace bets two and it’s over to
you. You two and up two.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: So that’s four? That’s four. ? Denai surenum
defit. Oh, there she is. A possible flush. Well, it’s the two queens to
bet! ——————————————————————————- Another hand? I think we’d better get
him to bed.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, he’s down here. You’re in my room, I’m in
his room and he’s down here. I wouldn’t dream of depriving the poor
fellow of his bed. Particularlly in that condition.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: It’s what he wants! No I don’t I want to get to
bed!</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Come on then luvy, lets get you to bed then. A
good nights sleep will do us both some good.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: We’ll I’ll say good night then Monty. I want to
be alone. He doesn’t want to sleep with you.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Right then, You’re in there and I’ll take the
couch. I’ll say night night then Monty. You already have. Twice!
——————————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What is it Monty, I’m terribly tired I need to
get to bed. But not that tired eh? Are you a sponge or a stone?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I beg you pardon Monty? Do you like to sample
all facets of life or do you shut yourself off from new experience.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I voted conserative Loyalty isn’t a matter of
selection.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I quite agree, it’s more a matter of chosing to
whom one is loyal. I’m terribly tired Monty, I need to get to bed. You
must mustn’t you. Off you go then. I’ll sleep down here. It won’t be the
first time I’ve been left with the couch! ——————————————————————————-
Boy! Boy! I know you’re not asleep boy. But he is. I’ve been into his
room. He won’t hear a thing.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No I’m not asleep. What is it Monty, what do you
want. I tried not to come, oh how I tried not to.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: There’s something I’ve got to tell you Monty.
There’s no need to explain, he’s told me everything.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What! What’s he told you? About how you came to
Chelsea and you arrest in the totenham court road. He told me about your
probelms, how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Probelms, what problems? You are a toilet
trader! Go with it boy, give into to it. It’s like a tide. Don’t let it
ruin your youth as I nearly did over Eric.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m not homosexual Monty Yes you are! Of course
you are. You’re only saying that to deny your relationship with him.
It’s not his fault that he can’t love you any more that it’s mine that I
adore you. Can’t we allow ourselves this one moment of indiscretion? He
need never know.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I don’t care what he knows, you must leave
Monty. I mean to have you even if it must be burgulary.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Monty you must listen! We’re in an affair, we
have been for years. But he’s estranged, he won’t allow himself to admit
it. That’s why he’s rejecting me while you’re here. On my life Monty,
this is the first time in six years we havn’t slept together. I couldn’t
cheat on him, it would kill him. Oh my dear boy, if I’d realised that
I’d never have attempted to come between you.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I know that Monty, I respected you for your
sensitivity, I thank you for it. You better go to him</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Oh, I intend to. This instant.
——————————————————————————- Withnail’s room</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Withnail you bastard wake up. Wake up you
bastard before I burn this bastard bed down. I deny all accusations.
What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’ve just narrowly avoided having a buggery. And
I’ve come in here with the express intention of wishing one on you. That
said, I’m leaving for London. Hold on, hold on. Don’t let you
imagination run away with you.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’ve just finished fighting a naked man. How
dare you tell him I’m a toilet trader! Tatical necessity. If I hadn’t
told him you were active we’d never have got the cottage.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I wouldn’t have wanted it, not with him in it. I
never thought he’d come all this way.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Monty!? He’d go to New York. Calcualted
risk.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What is all this calculated risk and tactical
necessity. It’s me, naked, in a corner. And how dare you tell him I love
you? And how dare you tell him you rejected me? How dare you tell him
that!? Sorry about that, got a bit carried away. Sort of said it without
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Well let me tell you something Withnail, if he
comes in my room again its murder and you’ll be held resposible in law.
——————————————————————————- The cottage</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: ‘Perhaps it is just that the evesdropper should
leave as his trade dictates, in secrecy and in the dead of night. I do
sincerely hope that you will find the happiness that has saddly always
been denied me. Yours faithfully, Montegue H Withnail.’ Poor old
bastard. Now I must say, that represents a level of hippocrasy in you
that I’d previously suspected but not noticed due to highly evasive
skills.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You’ll suffer for this Withnail. What you have
done will have to be paid for. I’ll say one thing for Monte; he keeps a
sensational cellar.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Who is it. VOICE: Telegram. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Well it doesn’t mean to say I’ve got the part.
They probably just want to see me again. Well, that settles it, we leave
immediately. What!?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Get you stuff together, we leave in half an
hour. Don’t be ridiculous, I need at least an hour for lunch.
——————————————————————————- The car You got a truck coming up in this
lane followed by a slow right-hander.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: This is insanity Stay in this lane</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What lane, I can’t see any lane. Bear right,
bear right.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I can’t keep this up. And I must get some sleep.
——————————————————————————- The car</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What’s going on? I’m making time.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Pull over, you haven’t got a license. No, I’m
making time. Here comes another fucker.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: On no. It’s perfectly alright, leave him to
me.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You’re full of scotch you silly tool. P1: Bit
early in the morning for festivities isn’t it sir? They’re not mine,
they belong to him. P1: You’re drunk. I assure you I’m not officer, I’ve
only had a few ales. P1: Out of the car. Please. Sir. P1: Would you fill
this bag please sir. P1: Are you refusing to fill this bag? I most
certainly am P1: I’m placing you under arrest. Don’t be ridiculous I
haven’t done anything. Listen, my cousin’s a QC. P2: Get in the back on
the van. ——————————————————————————- Police station P3: Serg, what’s
that clown up to? ——————————————————————————- The flat Where’s our
checks?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: We didn’t sign on. That wouldn’t make any
difference to last weeks payments.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What are you doing in my bed? D: Having a
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Who’s the huge spade in the bath? D: Presuming
Ed.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Well I want you out. You’ve got ten minutes
alright? Coz I want to get in. ——————————————————————————- The lounge
How did you get in? D: Inginuity man - come up the drainpipe. Would you
like a smoke? Yes</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No thanks, I’ve got a call to make. What are you
going to do with those? D: The joint I am about to roll requires a
craftsman and can utalise up to twelve spliffs. It is called a
Camberwell carrot.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: It’s imposible to use 12 papers on one joint. D:
It is impossible to roll a camberwell carrot with anything less. Who
says it’s a Camberwell carrot. D: I do. I invented it in Camberwell and
it’s shaped like a carrot. D: These will tend to make you very high. D:
This grass is the most powerfull in the western hemisphere. It grows at
exactly two thousand feet above sea-level. I have it special flown in
from my man in Mexico. His name’s Huang. He’s an expert. D: Did you get
the part man?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, I got a different one. They want me to play
the lead. Congratulations. D: Where exactly have you two been?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: A trip to the countryside. D: That is a very
good idea. London is a city coming down from its trip and there’s going
to be a lot of refugees. D: Did you realise this gafs overrun with
rodents? When I came in I saw one in the oven the size of a fucking
dog.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: That is a dog, belongs to the man downstairs. D:
Does his dog get in the oven. No his dog doesn’t come up here. D: Then
it was a rodent. Quite freeked me at the time. I was going to cook
onions. There was some bald gieser round here the other day reckoned you
owed him 235 quid backrent. I told him there was no question of paying
rent on a property infested with rodent. Started coming on all bald with
me. You mean ratty. D: I told him to piss off.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: You bloody fool. He’ll have us up in court
again. D: No he won’t, it’s not legal. We can quote you on that I
presume. D: Law rather appeals to me actually.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Just high.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Stop laughing will you Withnail, this is
serious. D: No it ain’t. I looked into it. Studied the papers.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: What papers? D: Legal papers.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Look, he’s got our checks. What are you doing
with these? D: I was going to pay them in for you.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: For christ’d sake Withnail, stop laughing will
you. Look, this is a notice of eviction Give it to my barrister. Ed:
Harriramma, Hariramma</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Shup up will you, you’re giving me the fear!
Give us a downer Danny, I’ve gone and fucked my brain. D: Sit down man,
take control. You have a rush. It will pass.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Aren’t you getting absurdly high? D: Precisely
the reason I’m smoking it. I couldn’t I’m spaced. D: Not as spaced as
you rodents.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Don’t talk about them. D: I expect they’re
talking to each other.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Talking to each other? What do you mean? D: I’ve
dealt with them. Given ’em all drugged onion.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Why’ve you drugged their onions!? D: Sit down
man, find your neutral space. You have done something to your brain. You
have made it high. If I lay 10 mills of diazipan on you, you will do
something else to your brain, you will make it low. Why trust one drug
rather than the other. That politics ain’t it.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I’m going to eat some sugar. D: I recommend you
smoke some more grass.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No way, no fucking way. D: That is an
unfortunate political decission. What are you talking about Danny? D: If
you are holding onto a rising balloon you are presented with a difficult
political decission - let go while you’ve still got the chance or hold
onto the rope and continue getting higher. That’s politics man. We are
at the end of an age. The greatest decade in the history of mankind is
nearly over. They’re selling hippy wigs in wolworths. It is 91 days to
the end of the decade and as presuming ed here has so consistently
pointed out, we have failed to paint it black.
——————————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: Right, I’m off now. Already?</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: My father will pick up my stuff in the week and
do something about the car. But I’ve got us a bottle open. Confiscated
it from Monte’s supplies. 53 Margaux. Best of the century</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I can’t Withnail, I’ll miss the train. There’s
always time for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I haven’t the time. Alright, I’ll walk with you
to the station. We can drink it through the park.
——————————————————————————- The Park</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No thankyou, no more. Look, it’s a stinker
Withnail, why don’t you go home. Because I want to walk you to the
station.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: No, really, I really don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>i:</strong>: I shall miss you Withnail. I’ll miss you too. I
have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth and indeed it
goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth
seems to me a sterile promotory; this most excellent canopy the air,
look you, this mighty o’rehanging firmament, this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire; why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and
pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man, how
noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, how like an angel in
