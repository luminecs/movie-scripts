<h1 id="drag-me-to-hell">drag-me-to-hell</h1>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: There is no friction, with proper
diction. Good sounds abound, when the mouth is round. She catches
herself on the last word, a hint of “Missouri twang” slipping
through.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Round. Yawn. She slips off her nightgown
and lumbers into the steaming shower.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well, you’re a little cutie.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hey! Slow down! The Van roars past. She
pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks Stephanie’s face. She sets it
down.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Go on home. Shoo now! She heads for the
Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back, frowning.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Shoo!</p>
<p><strong>mexican man</strong>: We keep getting the same thing. Because
I’m not employed by an American company, they won’t take my application
until they get my solvency statement. And the Mexican Treasury
Department says that’s going to take at least four more weeks.</p>
<p><strong>mexican woman</strong>: And the house will be gone by
then.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It says, here your employed by Pemex?</p>
<p><strong>mexican</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Isn’t Pemex a subsidiary of Union
Oil?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: So technically, your employer is an
American company. I think we can make this work. I’ll call you this
afternoon and let you know. The happy couple shake Stephanie’s hand and
exit. ELLEN, Stephanie’s pretty, twenty two year old, roommate, flops
down into the seat across from her.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I need clarification on the shoe issue.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: First of all– you know you’ve got the only
perfect pair of black dress shoes in L.A. So was that a definite,
irrevocable, “no way” or t just a rather not at this time, “no way”?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It’s an absolutely, positively, forget
about the shoes already, “no way”. They’re my only good pair and I need
them in good shape for tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s Up?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Dinner with Ray’s parents. Ellen picks up
a desktop photo: A shot of Stephanie and her handsome boyfriend, Ray,
locked in an embrace, standing in the spray of a waterfall.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Ray’s got a nice butt. Really tight</p>
<p><strong>and—</strong>: Stephanie takes back her photo.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: 1 –I know. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: He’s a keeper. But I told you about his mom,
she’s another story. I used to waitress at her country club, and with
her, it’s all about what private school you went to and who you know.
You still up for that promotion? That would help. Stephanie looks
longingly to…</p>
<p><strong>the vacant office</strong>: of the former Assistant Manager.
The large oak desk. The executive chair. Waiting to be filled. Stephanie
turns back, pushing the thought away.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’m not putting on a show. She’ll either
accept me for who I am or not.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Are you reading self help books again? The
Kitten peers out through Stephanie’s partially opened desk drawer.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hello there! Ellen reaches for the Kitty but
Stephanie waves her off.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: –Shhhl I can’t let my boss see him.
Stephanie glances to her manager, MR. JACKS, a heavyset man sitting
behind a large desk.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What about the shoes?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I told you. No. Now beat it.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Uh Oh. You better bring the kitty home
for me.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sure. If I can take the shoes.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I told you, no. Mr. Jacks sneezes again,
his eyes water. He turns to his</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Has someone brought a damned animal into
my bank?! Mr. Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading him
toward Stephanie’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Okay, fine! Take the shoes!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Just don’t expect me to take care of it. This
catches Mr. Jack’s Attention. He turns to the ladies, wondering what
they’re talking about. Stephanie takes Ellen’s hand and vigorously
shakes it goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Of course not. I’ll take care of
everything. And thanks for choosing Bank of California. Ellen plays
along.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Okay. Then I’ll see you later. I mean—
whenever the next time I’m in the bank. You know– for a loan.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Goodbye. As Ellen passes, Mr. Jacks
sneezes again, harder.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Someone has definitely brought an animal
in here. He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I don’t see any cats. Or any animals.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Hope to hell, not.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: By the way, I put the paperwork for the
Mcpherson loan on your desk.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Mcpherson?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That big corporate loan I’ve been trying
to set up? It’s just preliminary but–</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Oh, right. I’ll look it over when I get
the chance.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mr. Jacks, I was wondering it you had
made any decision regarding the Assistant Manager’s position yet?</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: I’m still deciding. Right now it’s
between Stu and yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Stu? The trainee? Stephanie turns to see
Stu, the balding loan officer who sits at his desk, watching, trying to
figure out what Jacks is saying to her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: I know he’s new but he’s also quite
aggressive and we like that. Don’t get me wrong, you’re well liked here,
but we’re also looking for someone who’s not afraid to crunch the
numbers and make the tough decisions.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mr. Jacks, I feel that I’m perfectly
capable of–</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: –I’ll let you know as soon as,I decide.
In the meantime, take him through our loan qualifying procedures… just
in case.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Oh. okay.</p>
<p><strong>mr jacks</strong>: And would you mind taking your lunch
now?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: And on your way back, maybe you could
bring me a turkey club? Stu overhears them as he passes by.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Turkey club. Excellent choice, J.J. Then to
Stephanie:</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mind picking one up for me?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No problem. Jacks heads back toward his
desk. Stephanie grabs her purse and keys and as she heads out, Stu calls
after her:</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: On toasted rye! And spicy mustard! Stephanie
doesn’t like fetching lunch for the trainee but hides her
displeasure.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The conscious mind abhors uncertainty. It seeks
a pattern or reason for everything. When we can’t find that pattern or
reason, we sometimes ascribe it’s cause to the world of the
supernatural. The spiritual world is created by the human mind to
conveniently explain everything we can’t. So when does a belief in the
supernatural cross into the field of abnormal behavior? Where do you,
the Psychologist, come in? When these beliefs negatively affect our
patients activities of daily living. Their jobs, their friends, their
sense of well being– The class bell RINGS.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Tomorrow we’ll be covering the clinical
manifestations of psychosis. You’ll find it all t referenced in the
text.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How’re things at the bank? How’s that new
position looking?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Really? You sounded so sure.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well, now there’s this new guy… they’re
considering him too. Ray sees how bummed out she is. He moves close,
taking her in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That job needs somebody with your experience.
They know that. Stephanie nods.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Oh, I’ve got something for you. She
rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope. He removes a coin.
An old nickle.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: A 1925 Indian head! Hey, good find. Where’d you
get it?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: One of the tellers found it for me. Ray
puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’d better get back to work. She quickly
gathers her things. Ray returns to grading his student’s exams. The
telephone RINGS. Ray hits the speakerphone.</p>
<p><strong>ray.</strong>: Doctor Dalton. It’s the voice of an older
woman, TRUDY.</p>
<p><strong>trudy on speakerphone</strong>: Hello dear.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec? He turns from
the phone, whispering to Stephanie:</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll call you tonight. She kisses Ray and
exits.</p>
<p><strong>ray’s voice</strong>: Nothing much. Just had lunch with
Stephanie. And trying to get these midterms graded– She halts as she
hears her name mentioned on Ray’s speakerphone. She moves closer to
Ray’s office to eavesdrop:</p>
<p><strong>trudy’s voice</strong>: –Stephanie? The one from the
farm?</p>
<p><strong>ray’s voice</strong>: You know who she is. She’s coming over
for dinner tomorrow night to meet you and dad.</p>
<p><strong>ray’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>trudy’s voice</strong>: I mean she’s just a teller at some
bank right? Raymond there’s a reason that your father and I raised you
in a certain way. We have expectations.</p>
<p><strong>ray’s voice</strong>: Please, mom, not this again–</p>
<p><strong>trudy’s voice</strong>: I heard that Julie Kulick is looking
for someone to play tennis with. You know she graduated Yale law with
honors. I’m told she’s quite a successful attorney now. I gave you her
number but her mother says you never called.</p>
<p><strong>ray’s voice</strong>: Because I’m with Stephanie. I’m not
looking for anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>trudy’s voice</strong>: Would it kill you to–</p>
<p><strong>ray’s voice</strong>: –Mom. I have to go. See you tomorrow
night. Okay? Bye. A downhearted Stephanie quietly exits.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She messed up my order. Stephanie heard
that.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No I didn’t, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Steph, I said “no mayo”.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You never said that. Stu rolls his eyes
to Mr. Jacks. Stephanie caught Stu’s look, but what can she do? She
exits.</p>
<p><strong>scratch… scratch…</strong>: Stephanie looks to the source of
the sound… A withered hand. An involuntary tremor causes it’s yellowed
fingernails to SCRATCH across the surface of Stephanie’s desk…</p>
<p><strong>scratch… scratch…</strong>: The hand belongs to MRS. SYLVIA
GANUSH, the aged woman who site across from Stephanie. She wears
a.formal dress and hat from another era. The outfit is threadbare in
spots but great care has been taken to maintain it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: Will you help me?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Of course. What can I do for you?
Mrs. Ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen handkerchief,
which she tucks back into her puree. She hands Stephanie a bunch of
crumpled papers. Stephanie reviews them.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mrs. “Ganush”? The old woman nods.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: This is a delinquency notice… it says
that the payment on your loan was due a number of months ago. And this
other document… is a court order for repossession. The bank is informing
you of their intent to repossess-your property at 325 Brandon street,
tomorrow.,</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: The trucks are there now. The men are
packing all my things. Private things. Please, make them stop. This is
my home for twenty years. And I make every payment until the sickness
took my eye. Mrs. Ganush turns her head to reveal a milky white eye.
Stephanie hides her revulsion.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well… do you have the payment with you
now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: I hope to get it soon. I just need a
little more time.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I don’t think my manager is going to
extend you anymore credit. I’d like to help but…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: Please. Won’t you try?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Okay. Wait here. Stephanie stands and
moves off. The Old Woman picks through a bowl of hard candies on
Stephanie’s desk. Stephanie stands before Mr. Jacks. He acknowledges her
without looking up from his work.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’ve got an elderly woman asking for an
extension on her mortgage payment.. They’re in the process of
repossessing her home. She’s on a fixed income and she’s had some
medical problems. I was wondering if we could give her a break.
Stephanie hands Mr. Jacks the loan file. He puts on his bifocals,
studies it. Stephanie glances over her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie’s p.o.v. - her desk</strong>: Mrs. Ganush looks
around to. make sure no one’s watching, then tips the bowl of hard
candies into her purse. She reaches. into her mouth and removes a set of
stained dentures that she wraps in her linen handkerchief. She places a
piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it with a wet SUCKING sound.
The Old Woman’s one good eye, wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on
the sugary treat.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Apparently, we’ve already granted her two
extensions. And you know on this type of foreclosure, the bank makes a
sizable amount in fees. He hands her back the file.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It would mean I’d have to throw her out
of her house.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Tough decision. Your call. He leans back
in his overstuffed leather chair and studies her. Stephanie glances to
the vacant office of the Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The
thick carpet. She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his
workstation.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’ll take care of it. Stephanie returns
to her desk.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mrs. Ganush, another extension on the
loan is out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: No. Please, it’s my home… I’m begging
you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I tried to talk my boss into it but he
just wouldn’t approve.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: But where will I live?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mrs. Ganush, you’ve given your
granddaughter as a reference… It says here, she lives nearby… Wouldn’t
you be better off living with her?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: I would not burden her.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Okay well, there’s several fine “assisted
living” facilities for the elderly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs ganush</strong>: A nursing home? No. I will never live in
one of those places1</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well, of course, that’s your choice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’m sorry there’s nothing I can do.
Mrs. Ganush begins to sob.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: I am proud woman, Miss Brown, and never
have I begged for anything. But I will beg for you now. This one time. I
humble myself before you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That isn’t necessary, please. Let’s not
make this personal. It’s just the bank’s policy. I’m really sorry
Mrs. Ganush. Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly
into a manila folder. she glances up but Mrs. Ganush is gone.. Stephanie
turns in her chair and is startled to see the old woman, kneeling before
her. She clutches Stephanie’s leg with her gnarled hands.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: Have mercy on me. Stephanie stands,
tries to pull free, but the old woman will not release her leg.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Please, let go. Customers turn to look.
Mr. Jacks glances up from his desk.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: I, Sylvia Ganush, beg. On my mother’s
grave, I beg you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Please, take your hands off me. But the
old woman only clutches tighter.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: t I’m calling security. She picks up the
phone and presses a button.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Could you please come over? Mrs. Ganush
finally releases her grip and bows her head in humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: You shame me. She composes herself.
Then, slowly stands, puffing up her chest. Mu3tering her damaged
pride.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: I begged you… Her one. good eye fixes
it’s hardened gaze upon Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: .and you shame me. Mrs. Ganush suddenly
grasps Stephanie’s arm. Stephanie tries to pull away but the old lady’s
grip is strong. Mrs. Ganush reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from
Stephanie’s wrist– but the Security Guard intervenes.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: I think your business here is
finished, ma’am. The Guard escorts Mrs. Ganush from the bank. Through
the banks’s window, Stephanie watches the Guard lead Mrs. Ganush to a
old, Chevy Cavalier on the street. Stephanie composes herself and when
she again looks up, the old woman’s car is gone.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: That was one nutty old lady. You okay?
Stephanie nods.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: You handled that just right. And by the
way, as far as the Assistant Manager’s position… You’re at the top of
the list.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Thanks. Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home.
Stephanie loads a pile of contracts, a ruler and a desk stapler into a
cardboard box and exits the bank. The Security guard locks up behind
her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: You bitch! I pluck out your fucking
eyes! Mrs. Ganush’s razor sharp fingernails lash out towards Stephanie’s
eyes. But Stephanie grabs the old woman’s wrists, halting her. The
withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie’s throat. Stephanie
fights for breath as she frantically searches for a weapon. Her hand
finds the box on the seat next to her. She grabs a handful of colored
push pins and jams them into the old woman’s arm. Mrs. Ganush releases
her grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before
Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie’s hair!. The old woman yanks
upon it. Stephanie’s head is pulled back, over the edge of the seat.
Ganush braces her feet against the back of the front seat to pull even
harder… Stephanie’s neck is now bent so far back it’s about to snap!
Stephanie’s hand finds the stapler, trips the release. It springs open.
She swings it back over her shoulder! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! With
each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush’s forehead. Ka-Thunk!
A lucky shot– the old lady’s white eye is stapled shut. The old woman
HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie’s hair only tightens. Stephanie, about
to black out, throws the car into gear and hits the gas. As the car’
accelerates, Stephanie fastens her shoulder harness with the last of her
strength. The old woman’s stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her
to see… an oncoming concrete column. Stephanie’s car slams into it.
Stephanie is held fast by her shoulder harness. But Mrs. Ganush’s body
hurtles forward over the front seat, impacting against the dashboard
with tremendous force. Close shot of the old woman’s head slamming into
the dash. In a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I beat you, you old bitch! Next time take
your Geretol! The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie’s view.
Stephanie looks about. Where’d she go? The old woman pops up into view,
raising a chunk of concrete and… CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window
shatters. The old woman’s head juts into the cart She clamps her
toothless maw down upon Stephanie.’s chin. Suckling it, gumming. The old
woman’s good eye rolls about in ecstacy. Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes
the slobbering head away. Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old
woman’s mouth to Ste phanie’s jaw. The old woman’s wrinkled hands grope
about the front seat. She finds her dentures, now damaged from the
fight. She GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth. She comes at
Stephanie, mouth wide open and SHRIEKING! Stephanie grabs the wooden
ruler from her cardboard box and shoves it down the old lady’s throat.
Mrs. Ganush gags, trying to retch up the ruler.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: You shamed me. The Old Woman reaches
down. Stephanie flinches. Mrs.’Ganush’s gnarled hand plucks a thin brass
button from the sleeve of Stephanie’s coat. She waves the button through
the air, and breathes out a single word:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: Lamia… Clouds move past the setting
Sun. A shadow falls over Stephanie. A cold wind makes her shiver.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What–? What are you doing? Stephanie sits
up, reaching for her button. But the old woman 1 moves it out of
reach.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: You want it? Stephanie snatches the
button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the
button into her coat pocket.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: Soon it will be you, who comes begging
to me. It begins tonight when you hear the cry.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What cry?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: The Lamia. It’s coming for you. A large
black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie’s face. She swats it away. Her
vision blurs and she grows dizzy. She leans against the car for support.
When she finally looks up, Mrs. Ganush is gone.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What about a restraining order?</p>
<p><strong>officer naimark</strong>: Well that’s usually only something
we do if there’s a pattern of harassment. But like I said, we’ll file a
report and keep it on record in case you do have a continuing problem.
But once we send an officer around to have a word with, her, I don’t
think she’ll be bothering you again.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Thank you, you’ve been very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just thank God you’re okay. You are okay,
right?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’m fine. Ray waits, sensing that there’s
more to it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Your fine, but…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I– It’s just that I could have gotten her
another extension. But I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Loo]. You said the bank had already granted her
two extensions.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I guess. A breeze. She shivers. He wraps
his arms around her protectively and after a moment, they walk on.
Stephanie watches wistfully as a YOUNG COUPLE coo over their BABY.
Behind the couple, Stephanie notices a neon sign in a storefront window.
It reads: PSYCHIC.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Let’s get our fortune’s read!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re kidding right? She cajoles a protesting
Ray through the front door of the establishment.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just hope to God none of my students see me
here. Five bucks says he’s wearing a turban. A beaded curtain parts,
revealing… Rham Jas, a small, dark skinned, fifty year old Indian man.
He wears a plain black suit and a white turban. His inquisitive eyes
evaluate the couple.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: I am Rham Jas. Seer.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: How do you do? I’m Stephanie Brown and
this is Ray…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: But you probably already knew that. Just
kidding. Rham Jas gives Ray a tight smile.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: We’d like to have our fortunes read. Can
you do that? Read the future?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: I have the ability to see certain
energies… Sometimes these ’ energies are a foretoken of things to come.
Sometimes not. Sixty dollars, please.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sixty dollars? Isn’t that a little steep for
this kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Then go. There are many who would claim to
be seers. But they are not. Although you would pay them little… you
would receive nothing. If you.are not serious, go. Rham Jas turns to
depart through the beaded curtain.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Wait. She removes some bills from her
purse but Ray waves her off, handing Rham Jas a credit card.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Platinum card. Very good. He swipes Ray’s
card through the credit card machine. INT Rham Jas’S BACK ROOM - NIGHT A
sparsely furnished, dimly lit room. The walls are lined with old books.
Rham Jas stands before Stephanie and Ray, who sit at a card table.
Stephanie giggles with excitement.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Sorry. Rham Jas smiles back.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: That’s quite all right. So, you wish to
know something of your destiny. Very good. We shall see what the fates
have in store. Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the
curtains.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Freud said destiny was not an act of fate but
rather something created by our subconscious to control our conscious
choices.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: That is true. But… “We should not pretend
to understand the world only by intellect.”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Carl Jung…</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Yes. From his treatise “Psychological
types”.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jung– the New Agers’ favorite psychologist.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Because he wasn’t afraid to bring God into
the equation. Rham Jas takes a seat at the table, across from
Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Your hand, please. Stephanie extends her
hand to Rham Jas. He closes his eyes and concentrates. Stephanie smiles
excitedly to Ray, who raises a skeptical eyebrow.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: You,work with money.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That’s right! 4</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: But… you’ve lost something.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: No. No, you’re right. Something’s been
taken from you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No, I- Rham Jas grabs her arm and turns
it, revealing the threads. that once held the button on her coat
sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: A button.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well, yes! Some Old Woman…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well anyone can see she lost a button. So
what?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: But Ray, it was very strange. At the bank
today. The old woman… the one I told you about… she plucked the button
right from my sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why would she do that?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: If you would please, both be quiet. Rham
Jae concentrates, his eyelids flutter. Stephanie appears uneasy. The
flame of the candle begins to flicker as a breeze sweeps through the
room. The wind chimes TINKLE. Ray pulls his collar closed against the
sudden chill in the air. Rham Jas’s back stiffens.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: I think that is enough for now.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Wait. You saw something. What?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m tired and I see it’s become
quite late. Of course I will refund your money.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Tell me. Please. Rham Jas hesitates,
then…</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: A bad spirit has come upon you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting
a grave site?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Do you play with Ouija board or confer
with those who practice the black arts?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What is this?!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Then perhaps someone has cursed you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Who? 0</p>
<p><strong>close on the threads</strong>: where the brass button once
was.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: How did he know all that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Know what? That you lost,a button?1 He makes
some good guesses, stirs you up, leaving you with a lot of questions.
And conveniently, his business card. C’mon, he’s a scam artist.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: He didn’t want the money. He tried to
give the money back.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: In the end, he took it, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So this is him. Got a name?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Uh… just “Kitty” so far.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sure you don’t want me to spend the night?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Don’t tempt me. I’ve got to prep a
presentation for the morning.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: okay. Ray kisses her, opens the front door and
exits. He calls back to her from his car:</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Remember, dinner at my folk’s house, tomorrow
night. We’re supposed to bring desert. I could pick something up?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. I’m planning on baking my special
cake.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sounds good. Try not to stay up too late. Ray
waves and steps into his car. Stephanie watches him drive off.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Isn’t he adorable?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Let’s hope the landlord thinks so. She sets
down,the kitten and picks up her overnight bag. 0</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: What about you? You going to be okay? You know, I
don’t have to go out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No, I’m fine. Have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Do I look great? Be honest.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie.</strong>: You look great. Ellen smiles, grabs her
car keys and heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: But… Isn’t that Marci’s dress?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah. And if she calls, tell her not to go
bi-polar on me, I’ll’get it back to her by tomorrow. Or the next day.
Bye! Ellen exits. Stephanie places butter into a mixer for the cake
frosting. Through the kitchen window we can see Ellen walking down the
path, toward the street. She steps through the iron gate, latching it
closed behind her.</p>
<p><strong>window:</strong>: In the reflection, as the light bulb
flickers, we see a flash of ghostly hands that grope at her body. They
reach up through the floor, and clutch at her legs, buttocks and
breasts.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Get off me! Get off! The phantom hands
vanish. Stephanie looks about, eyes wild.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So she came to your house? This is crazy. I’m
calling that police officer. He begins to dial but Stephanie stops
him.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Ray, you’re not listening. It wasn’t her.
It was something that she sicked on me…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I didn’t tell you the whole story. That
old woman… after she knocked me down, and pulled the button from my
coat, she told me that…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: She said that something was coming for
me… and it did. Ray stares at her with concern.</p>
<p><strong>doctor rangavertz</strong>: Ray, you were right to call me.
Never a good idea to be personally involved with your patient.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>doctor rangavertz</strong>: 1b Medically, she’s fine. She’s
just very distraught. She’s displaying some paranoia and a sense of
panic. Classic symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder. Probably a
result of being assaulted by that old woman. Doctor Rangavertz scribbles
out a prescription and hands it to Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How worried should I be?</p>
<p><strong>doctor rangavertz</strong>: We’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Better now. At the time it just seemed so
real. I’m so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t be, you had a terrible day and you.got a
little wigged out. It happens.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: po, what now, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I was gonna surprise you, but what the hell.
I’ve been planning a little trip for us this week end. Saturday morning
we’re taking a train to Santa Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: My family owns a cabin up there. In, the hills.
Overlooking this little river. We’ll light a fire, drink some champagne
and screw our brains out.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You sure know how to talk to a girl.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s a chance to just be together. Undisturbed.
There’s a lot of stuff I want to talk to you abqut but it never seems to
be the right time.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Sounds nice. She draws in a deep breath
and for the first time that evening, she looks at peace. Ray watches,
her as she closes her eyes and drifts off to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mrs ganush</strong>: You shamed mel MATCH CUT to: Ray SHAKING
her!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Steph! Wake Upl</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Oh my God: Oh Godl</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It was just a dream. It’s okay. She gets
control. Ray smooths out the tangled hair from her sweaty face. He looks
deeply into her eyes, afraid of what’s happening to her. The phone in
the next room, RINGS.’Ray looks over, decides to ignore it. It keeps
RINGING.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll be right back. He steps into the next room
and we hear him answer the phone. Stephanie sighs and lays back down…
next to Mrs. Ganush! The Old Woman is covered in.a swarm of BLACK FLIES!
Stephanie</p>
<p><strong>shrieks!</strong>: The Old Woman opens her maw, exposing
sharp broken teeth. She lunges for Stephanie! Stephanie grabs the old
woman by her hair, halting the chomping teeth inches from her face. She
tries to push Mrs. Ganush away. But the Old Woman’s yellowed teeth SNAP
and press ever closer. The muscles in Stephanie’s arms are trembling.
She is weakening. Mrs. Ganush, closes in, about to clamp her teeth down
upon Stephanie’s face when– Stephanie suddenly awakens with a GASP. It
was all a dream within a dream. She bolts up out of bed. Takes her
bearings. She’s alone in Ray’s bedroom. She checks the bathroom. Under
the bed. All normal. Ray enters.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You, okay?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. No– Oh my God. I had some 4 dreams.
Awful.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Want to tell me about them?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: The old lady. She was here… I couldn’t
wake up. Stephanie shakes her head. She can’t finish. Ray pulls back the
drapes. Sunlight pours into the room. Stephanie tries to put the dream
out of her mind. Ray sits next to her, strokes her hair.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Doctor Rangervertz said you could stop by his
office during your lunch hour. Stephanie nods.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I had them replace the window last night. Still
needs some body work.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie-</strong>: Thank you, Ray. She closes her eyes and
takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’ve got to be prepared that it might take
some time for you to get over this. She nods.</p>
<p><strong>stu rubin</strong>: Hi Steph. Just getting here?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What are you, the hall monitor?</p>
<p><strong>stu rubin</strong>: Ha ha! You’re funny, Steph.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>stu rubin</strong>: I need you to finish teaching me the loan
procedures.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’ve got a lot on my mind. Let’s do it
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>stu rubin</strong>: Sure. I’ll just tell Mr. Jacks that you
don’t have the time right now. Maybe he can show me. She glances up.
Mr. Jacks’is still watching her.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No, no, that’s all right. I’ll do it.
Where were we?</p>
<p><strong>stu rubin</strong>: We were going over the asset-based
lending guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Right. Okay. Let’s say your client is a
company that can’t get traditional bank financing but 10 needs a secured
loan. We offer–</p>
<p><strong>scratch… scratch…</strong>: Stephanie looks around for the
source of the sound, but can’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: .uh, we offer several types of
asset-based lending which consist of revolving lines of credit and term
loans secured by accounts receivables, their inventory, machinery– ,</p>
<p><strong>scratch… scratch…</strong>: Stephanie sees… That Stu’s hand
has been replaced by MRS. GANUSH’S… it’s yellowed fingernails SCRATCH
across her desk. She looks again, and Stu’s hand has returned to
normal.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: —and?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: –And get your filthy pig knuckle off my
desk! Stu is taken aback by Stephanie’s outburst. He retreats to his
desk in confusion. Stephanie sits, rattled. A drop of blood falls onto a
piece of paper on her desk. The blood is trickling from her nose.
Stephanie grabs a tissue to halt the bleeding. She looks down to see a
large black fly land upon the drop of blood. She gasps and stands, her
mind racing. She knows what she must do. She finds Mrs. Ganush’s loan
documents. She stuffs them into a folder, grabs her purse and bolts for
the exit. Mr. Jacks engaged with a customer, calls after her:</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Stephanie? Where are you going? She moves
quickly out the door, pretending not to hear him.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mrs. Ganush? No answer. She steps
inside.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mrs. Ganush? ’ She moves forward into the
living room.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: I knew you’d come. Stephanie almost
jumps out of her skin. As her eyes adjust she sees Mrs. Ganush sitting
on a crate in the corner of the room. Her arthritic hands clutching a
yellowed photograph.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hi. I’m here because I think I can help
you. I can get your house back for you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: It’s so empty now.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie .</strong>: I can arrange for all your furniture to
be brought back. Would that be okay? Mrs Ganush does not look up from
the photograph.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: So… on behalf of the bank I just want to
resolve this to your satisfaction. This whole thing got personal and
there was really no reason for that. The bank made a mistake and I can
fix it for you and in return I’d like you to- cancel or call off,
whatever you… you know– that thing you did to me. Okay? No hard
feelings. So…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: My mother was a proud woman. Dignity.
That’s what she had. Stephanie nods. Waits an appropriate moment, then:
places the document gently down on the floor next to Mrs. Ganush.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: All you need to do is. sign here…
Stephanie offers her a pen.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: .and I’ll take care of the rest.
Mrs. Ganush’s hard eyes find Stephanie’s. They bore in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush</strong>: It was what I wanted before you shamed
me. Now I want to see you suffer.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Please! I’ve suffered enough!</p>
<p><strong>mrs ganush</strong>: Not yet! Mrs. Ganush suddenly erupts in
a broken toothed CACKLE.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You’re insane! Just… just a crazy old
woman! I don’t even know why I came here!</p>
<p><strong>1 mrs. ganush</strong>: You know why. Terrified, Stephanie
runs from the place.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie’s pov - on the street</strong>: Stu Rubin walking
with two well dressed executives.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Stu? The men warmly escort into the First
National Bank.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What’s he doing at First National? The
car behind her HONKS! She drives on.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: What did it sound like.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Like… shrieking. It was awful. He nods.
Closes the book.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: That would be the Lamia. The “Black
Goat”.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Lamia. Right. That’s the word the old
woman used.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: It is a nasty spirit. A taker of souls. A
creature of misfortune for you and those around you. It is often
summoned by the Gypsies for their dour deeds. On the third day the Lamia
comes for the owner of the accursed object.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Accursed object? What object?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Something that the old woman took from
you, cursed, then gave back. Now it dawns on Stephanie. She looks to the
threads on her coat.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: The button…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: .this? She holds the button up for him to
inspect. But it’s presence makes him uneasy..He wags his finger back and
forth. She lowers it.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What if I just burn the thing?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: No matter what condition the button is in,
you would still be the owner. The Lamia would still come to take
you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Take me where?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: There’s got to be something I can do.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Yes. There are many ways to appease a
spirit. The simplest is a blood offering. An animal sacrifice. A small
creature would do. You could sacrifice a chicken. It’s all in here… Rham
Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he sets before
her.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No way. I’m a vegetarian. I’m a member of
PETA, for Christ’s sake. I don’t go around killing animals.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: You will be surprised what you will be
willing to do when the Lamia comes for you. She considers his words,
looks down to the book. CLOSE ON A DIAGRAM OF AN ANIMAL SACRIFICE - A
creature’s heart being cut from it’s body. CAMERA pulls back to reveal
that Stephanie now site at her kitchen table, reading the book. We see
other diagrams: The heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire.
The burial of the smoking heart. Stephanie’s kitten PURRS, as it rubs
against her leg. Stephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing
images. She hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside. She moves to the
window and peers out. The rusting iron gate is open. Stephanie senses a
change in the room… Shadows shift and grow deeper. The air is suddenly
oppressive. Something is coming.</p>
<p><strong>scratch… scratch…</strong>: She runs upstairs into her
bedroom and locks the door.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Ellen? ! But it’s not Ellen. Stephanie
puts her,ear to the door. The sound of an animal’s hooves on wood.
Something is climbing the stairs. It stops outside her bedroom door.
Stephanie holds her breath, listening. She sees a shadow beneath the
crack in the door.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I know that you’re there! The window
behind her explodes into the room with a deafening</p>
<p><strong>roar!</strong>: She ducks for cover. Another window is blown
inward and the glass sent her way. She SCREAMS and runs toward the
bathroom door. It SLAMS shut in her face! BOOM! Another window is
SHATTERED by the angry, unseen thing. The force knocks her to the bed.
The blankets are torn from the mattress, throwing Stephanie to the
floor. The bedsheets whisk around the room, flapping and twisting about
like 1b drunken ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Here kitty-kitty… Here, kitty-
kitty-kitty… She moves closer until her face fills the screen.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie’s backyard garden afternoon</strong>: She buries
the heart in a corner of her garden. She turns on the garden hose,
washing the cat’s blood from the knife.</p>
<p><strong>ellen’s voice</strong>: Steph? Stephanie quickly tosses the
knife into the bushes. Ellen appears.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: t Didn’t you hear me calling? I was looking
all over for you. Are you power eating Clark bars again? ’Cause there’s
about ten thousand wrappers all over the– Oh my God, is that blood?1
Stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden. But no blood
shows.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. Why would there be blood?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Right there, on your sleeve. Stephanie
glances at the red spot on her sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That’s just tomato juice. I was inside
making a salad and… I cut a tomato and I must have gotten it on my
sleeve. Ellen gives her roommate a worried look.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Look, Steph, we’re friends so if something’s
wrong…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I had some problems. A situation. But I
think everything is going to be good now. Ellen isn’t so sure.</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: It’s a photo of 16 year old Stephanie. She
was obese. Her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a “4- H” tee
shirt. She stands before some barnyard animals, a bucket of feed in her
hand.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Go with the short skirt.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What about this one? She hold up a
longer, more formal dress.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Uh uh. That one’s saying “I’m trying to
impress you with my conservative taste.”</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: But that’s what I want it to say. Ellen
shakes her head, no. Stephanie takes a last look in the mirror, decides
to go with the short skirt.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Okay. This is it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tell me again… the exact words he used.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Just that this little cabin would be a
great place for us to really connect and that there was something he’d
been meaning to talk about with me.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh my god, you are so engaged! Ellen’s smile
fades. She shakes her head despondently.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What’s wrong? I</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: t I just know that Rob’s never going to ask
me.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: But I thought you said that relationship
was only physical.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, I’d never marry a guy like that… but I’d
still like him to ask me.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>ray’s voice</strong>: Let’s get a look at that dress. She
steps from the car and models the dress. S</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You like</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I like.</p>
<p><strong>ray and stephanie</strong>: drive through the streets of Bel
Air, Stephanie at the wheel. She tunes in a rock station and turns it up
loud. She smiles at Ray and takes his hand. She hits the gas and her
Ford Focus opens up, accelerating down a long, tree lined street, the
wind blowing through their hair.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It’s just that I’m not, some ivy leaguer
with an impressive resume. I have a feeling that’s what your folks
really want.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Maybe. But in the end, it’s about what you and
I want.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Is that so? Ray gives her a reassuring
nod. The front door opens revealing Ray’s parents, GEORGE AND TRUDY
DALTON. Behind them we glimpse an exquisitely furnished foyer.</p>
<p><strong>raymondl</strong>: She kisses her son.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stephanie, this is my mother, Trudy, and my
Father, George. Trudy glances at Stephanie’s revealing cocktail dress
with thinly veiled disapproval. Stephanie self-consciously tugs it
lower.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nice tp meet you, Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It’s very nice to meet you, too.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Please, come in.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You have a lovely home.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks. I’ll get us something to drink. As
George exits, Stephanie presents her home made cake to Trudy.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I hope you don’t mind. I baked something
for you. Trudy hesitates, then takes the cake from Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: It’s lovely. Homemade.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It’s a harvest cake.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Harvest cake? Is’that some kind of cake you
make on a… farm?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: We used to, yeah, when you have a lot of
extra duck eggs. Especially right before spring; that’s when you get a
real dense yolk. Makes for, rich cake. The mother forces a smile.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: You must give me the recipe sometime.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Sure. It’s easy. The real secret’s in the
milk. You want it unpasteurized.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Unclean… Uh… I mean “unpasteurized”? Is that
safe?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Uh huh. And you want that milk still
warm. Straight from the cow. Trudy has to stifle her gag reflex. George
returns and hands Ray and Stephanie a cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Excuse me while I go find someplace to put
this. As Trudy takes away the cake, a cat rounds the corner. It HISSES
at Stephanie. She takes a step back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Never could understand that damned animal.
Hate cats. Trudy returns from the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: That’s strange. Hecuba’s usually very
sweet.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That’s okay. I had a cat. I
understand.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What do you mean “had a cat”? What happened to
him?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: How would I know what happened? Probably
nothing. You know how cats are. They come and they go. Ray nods slowly.
About to say something but let’s it go.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Still keeping up with your coin collection,
Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I try to. In fact Stephanie just found me a
1925 Indian Head nickel at her bank.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really? So, how long have you been working
there, Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Almost two years now.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: The job of a bank teller must be so
difficult. I’d think with all the counting and the repetition, it’d
become so tedious.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes, you’re right. But I’m not a
teller.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stephanie’s a loan officer in charge of small
business and home loans. And she’s on a fast track for a promotion.
Right, Steph?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’d like to think so… actually, It
depends. If I could close this big account that I’m working on, it would
really help.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Must be a very important loan.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It would be the biggest that my branch
has ever handled.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How’’d it come to you?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well, I was reading the Wall Street
Journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was
interested in expanding but didn’t have the liquidity. I met with their
CFO and presented a formula for restructuring-some of their long term
debt. It created an environment where I was able to offer them a rather
attractive loan</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You sure sound like you’ve got a lot going
for you, Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Your mother must be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I suppose. I don’t see her much.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well, ever since my dad died she doesn’t
talk much. She mostly stays on the farm and… keeps to herself. Because…
There is an awkward silence.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Does your mother have a drinking problem?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cut her some slack, mom, she–</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes. I’m afraid she does.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. And
I find your honesty refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: t You’ve got back bone. Not like that other
girl Ray brought by… What was her name? Alicia? She was dreadful. So
ill-mannered. And no ambition.</p>
<p>****: He found her through the,internet.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mors, please.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Stephanie, am I being too tough on Ray?
Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at Ray.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. Not at all. That’s what mom’s are
for.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will try that
Harvest cake of yours, after all. Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie
tastes the cake and emits a tiny cough.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Excuse me. She clears her throat. But the
cough returns, grows larger.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Just a little tickle in my– She stands
and takes a few steps away from the table. Ray looks on concerned.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Oh! OH MY GOD! The fly lazily BUZZES across
the table, slowly circling Trudy’s head. Trudy spits out a mouthful of
harvest cake into her napkin. George lowers his fork and pushes away his
plate of unclean farm cake. Ray is baffled, too stunned to speak.
Stephanie’s gaze shifts to the kitchen door. From The other side, she
hears the sound of a hoofs. Ray tries to cover for Stephanie:</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m so sorry, Stephanie. I don’t know how that
fly got. into your–</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: –Wait. What’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: What sound-?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: SHHH! Listen! Trudy listens along with
the others. They can’t hear anything. But Stephanie hears the FOOTSTEPS
drawing closer.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Must be deafer than a post! But Trudy
heard that and takes offense. But before she can say anything, a SHADOW
appears at the base of the door. Stephanie stands and shouts at it:</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: Leave me alone! Just leave me the fuck alone!
Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past Trudy’s head. It
shatters against the base of the door, spraying everyone with bits of
broken china and fish. The shadow and FOOTSTEPS are gone. Ray rushes to
her side.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Steph, it’s okay! There’s nothing there. She
looks about. George and Trudy regard Stephanie as if she were mad.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I… I think I’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I think that’s best, dear. She heads for the
door. Ray starts to go after her but his</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Let her go, Ray. She’s a sick girl.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: She needs me. Trudy grabs Ray’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I’m telling you not to go after her. Ray
gently pulls free of his mother’s grasp and chases after Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What did you see in there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: The thing that’s coming for me. What the
old woman sent.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen to me. What you’re going through right
now– It’s like the doctor said, it’s a stress reaction and –</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. I wanted to believe that– but it’s
real, Ray. You just don’t want to open your eyes to it because it
threatens you. Because if I’m right and there is something out there,
then you’d have to throw out everything you teach. And where’d that
leave you? Like a plow without a mule. Ray just stares at her. A long
moment passes as he wonders if maybe she isn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Unless you’re willing to take a chance
and believe in me, I can’t be with you any more. She steps into the car
and drives off. Ray watches her tail lights, as they vanish into the
night.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the eye</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia Ganush. Is
she here? The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old
Gypsy girl. ILENKA GANUSH. Bottle of beer in her hand, long black hair,
earrings and a snake tatoo on’her neck. She wears a low cut shirt and
tight shorts. EASTERN EUROPEAN HIP HOP and LAUGHTER are heard from
within the house.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: I’m Ilenka, Sylvia’s granddaughter. Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Stephanie Brown. I’m… sort of… a friend
of hers. Actually, I’ve been trying to help her with a loan</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: Wait. I know who you are. Grandma told me
you’d come. You’re the woman from the bank. The one who took her
house.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It was really the bank that took the
house. I just work there. In fact, I tried to help your grandma get-the
house back, but my boss wouldn’t let me. Ilenka knows she’s lying.
Stephanie knows that she knows.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: That’s not what happened, is it? Are you
going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: . no.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: You used to be a real fat girl, to didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: I can tell. You know, you caused my grandma
a lot of pain. That house was her pride. When you took that from her,
she had nothing left. You’re not welcome here. She starts to close the
door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate now, no where else to turn.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Okay! I did it. It was me who denied her
the loan. I was trying, to get ahead at work and I shouldn’t have done
it. It was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: Damn straight it was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: And I’m ashamed about it. And I’m going
to get down on my hands and knees and beg her to forgive me. She
said-that I hadn’t suffered enough. But now I think she’ll see that I
have and then maybe she’ll let me…</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: .make everything all right for her, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes. Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic
smile. She motions for Stephanie to follow. They enter a room filled
with young Gypsies drinking, smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic
tongue. A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice. A
Hungarian man with a long, braided ponytail, curses his bad luck as he
pays cash to the woman.</p>
<p><strong>’ stephanie</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: Still going to make everything all right?
The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table. Ilenka addresses
the crowd in Hungarian. She tells them that it was this white trash farm
girl that threw her grandmother t from her home and that she now bears
the curse of Lamia. A mother shields her daughter’s eyes from the sight
of Stephanie, the cursed one, then hurriedly kisses her .crucifix. A man
spits at her feet then walks off.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No, please– I needed her to take this
thing off me.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: It will never come off.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You know about it? Then, please help me.
I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: She said you’d come begging. I only wish she
could have lived to see it. The blood drains from Stephanie’s face.</p>
<p><strong>ilenka</strong>: .maybe she can… Stephanie glances down to
the corpse. It’s head is now facing her. It’s dead eyes, OPEN!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Fuck that! I paid you a hundred and
seventy nine dollars for that book!</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: It was a limited printing! Please control
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I did what you said- that blood offering…
I killed that little kitty deader than Hogan’s goat. Lotta good that did
me.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: We are dealing with elusive and powerful
forces. There are no guarantees. She wants to shout, but instead, closes
her eyes and sits.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Just tell me what to do. Rham Jas
considers. A dark look crosses his face. Stephanie tries to read his
expression.</p>
<p><strong>close on stephanie’s mastercard</strong>: It’s run through
the carbon paper. Rham Jas hand her a receipt. She signs it. He
sits.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: We must somehow dissuade the spirit from
taking your soul.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: 1 A seance. And it should be soon. For
tomorrow will be the third night…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Have you done this before?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: No. But I know someone. I can arrange what
is necessary, but you must understand that everyone involved in this
would be taking a great risk with their lives.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What would you need from me? Rham Jas
thinks for a moment, weighing the dangers. He pulls out a pipe and packs
it with tobacco. He tamps it down and lights up.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Twenty thousand dollars. Cash. By
tomorrow. 5</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Ellen. I’m sorry. This a bad time right
now. I got a little emergency and… say you got any cash I can borrow?
She starts stuffing the valuables into a large duffle bag.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: No, I don’t. But Steph I–</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: –what about your credit cards? What’s
your cash advance limit?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Steph, we need to talk about the cat.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Where has that little rascal been? He’s
always running off, have you noticed that?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Stephanie. I was in the back yard and I saw
where the ground was dug up. I started digging and… You buried that
little kitty in our backyard. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I didn’t want to tell you. It fell out
the window and died. It’s sad,</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I found the bloody knife in the bushes.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What are you, a cat detective?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Steph? I’m going to tell you this as your
friend. There is something seriously wrong with you. Stephanie looks up
from,her frantic panting.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Uh… Duhi</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m moving out. I can’t live like this.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie.</strong>: Fine. Ellen exits. Stephanie angrily
calls after her:</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: An’ don’t let the barn door hit you on
your ass on yer way out!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I can’t get the twenty thousand. You’re
gonna have to help me with what I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas’ voice</strong>: What do you have? She covers the
mouthpiece, speaking to someone off camera.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: How much?! CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
that we are’in a PAWN SHOP. Men haggle loudly in Arabic over the price
of a gold chain. The PAWN BROKER stands before-all of Stephanie’s
worldly belongings: A toaster oven, computer, racing bike, stereo,
microwave oven, necklaces, jewelry…</p>
<p><strong>pawn broker</strong>: Thirty-eight hundred for
everything.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Including my jewlery?</p>
<p><strong>pawn broker</strong>: Including. Stephanie curses under her
breath, checks the balance on her checkbook, does the math, speaks into
the phone;</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Six thousand.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: I’m sorry. Not possible.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Look, I’ll give you six now and–</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: No. There will be others involved and I
cannot-ask them to accept such a risk for less. Good night. He hangs up.
The line goes dead. She tries to throw the phone but it’s attached with
a short metal cord. She turns to the Pawn Broker.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’ll take it! Stephanie thinks about how
she’ll get the extra cash. She hesitantly dials a number on the pay
phone. It rings and rings as she glances to a picture buried deep in her
wallet: A. photo of… The younger, obese Stephanie and her stern looking
Mother. Both stand before a bleak snow covered, mid-western farm.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mom? Hi, it’s me. Did you get,the
Christmas card? Yeah, I guess it has been a while. Listen, I’m in kind
of a fix, here. I’ve been pretty sick and I need to borrow some money
for an operation. I need fourteen thousand dollars right away. Now I
know you still have that pension fund at the credit Union so– yeah, but…
okay. Okay, it’s just that— I understand. Okay, mom. Bye. The line goes
dead. She slumps down against the pay phone.</p>
<p><strong>close shot - stephanie</strong>: She pouts her lips in the
mirror, carefully applying lipstick. Looking good.</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: To reveal we are in the employee bathroom
at the bank. She fixes her hair so it’s just right. She. straightens out
a tiny wrinkle in her business suit, smiles her best upbeat smile and
exits the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mr. Jacks, this is kind of awkward for
me… I know it’s not official yet, but I was wondering if I could get a
copy of the employment contract for the new position you offered me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: The assistant manager’s position?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes. See, one of my family members is
having a little emergency which requires me to get them an immediate
loan–</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: –Stephanie… There’s a problem. The
McPherson deal was cancelled last night.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What? 1</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: Yeah, right after I informed the main
branch that we had this big loan pending,,I find out that they just made
their deal over at First National. I got a call in to see, what exactly
happened but right now this doesn’t look too good for you or me. So this
assistant manager promotion has been delayed. In fact, I think that with
everything that’s been happening, I’m gonna have to give that job to
Stu. Stephanie is devastated.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Stu. I see. Mr. Jacks sees tears begin to
well up in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks</strong>: I’m sorry. Look. If you’ve got family
problems. Maybe you should take the day off and sort them out. Stephanie
node and exits the bank.</p>
<p><strong>close shot - the wall clock</strong>: As it TICKS away the
seconds. CLOSE SHOT - THE Inadequate PILE OF CASH That site atop
Stephanie’s Kitchen table.</p>
<p><strong>close shot - a despondent stephanie</strong>: stares down at
the cash. Her mouth mechanically opens to accept a large serving spoon
of Rocky Road ice cream which she eats directly from the one gallon tub.
The door bell rings. A moment later Ray walks in.. Stephanie stands,
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>ray.</strong>: I paid Rham Jas</p>
<p><strong>stephaine</strong>: But I thought you didn’t believe…</p>
<p><strong>ray’</strong>: I don’t. But you do. I know this is important
for, you . she embraces him.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Are you coming in?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: I wanted to but Rham Jas said non believers
weren’t welcome. I still don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I know how crazy this must seem. But it
will all be over after this I swear to you. He nods. She kisses him.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’ll call you when it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll be waiting.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: We’ll laugh about it on the train,
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: t Yeah. Stephanie steps from the car. Ray
drives off. She turns to face the old house.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Miss Brown. Allow me the pleasure of an
introduction… A woman rises from the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: .Shaun San Dena The eighty year old woman
smiles a toothless smile to Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Shaun San Dena is an experienced 41
medium. Furthermore, she has a personal knowledge of the Lamia.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: I first encountered this spirit
forty years ago in a small village outside of Bucharest.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>shuan san dena</strong>: I lost a young boy’s soul to the
beast.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That’s reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: I was an. inexperienced seer then.
I’ve learned much since that woeful day. I have waited these long years
for a chance at redeeming myself. A chance to destroy the foul thing.
Tonight my chance will come. But to summon it, I will need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’ll do whatever it takes. And the sooner
the better.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: Our business must wait till darkness
falls. Enough time for tea.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: My late husband, Sandor, was also a
medium. He chose this site to build the’house upon because he sensed
certain energies that intersected here…</p>
<p><strong>rham jas ’</strong>: And through which, others might pass
into our world. Milos removes the tea.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: It is time for us to begin. Shaun
San Dena turns out the electric lights, leaving only the tables’
candlelight for illumination. We hear the BLEATING of a goat. Stephanie
startles. Milos reenters the room pulling a black goat along by a chain.
The goat catches sight of Stephanie. It BLEATS in fear and attempts to
run. But Milos holds it fast and tethers it to a post. He moves to the
table and lifts a velvet cloth revealing a large cattle slaughtering
blade.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: Lord Jesus bless this knife and
allow it to do your holy work. She makes the sign of the cross. she
pours a .vial of holy water over the blade. She turns to Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: Once the spirit has entered me,
place my hand upon the animal. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: I will force the spirit of the Lamia
into the goat. Milos, that’s when you strike. Stephanie blanches but
remains silent.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: We must all.be receptive. Shaun San
Dena begins to intone a Romanian Gypsy chant. Stephanie leans close to
speak quietly with Rham Jae.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What do I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: You must allow the darkness in. You must
invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit..</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Yes. Now repeat these words… I welcome the
dead into my soul… Rham Jae waits for Stephanie’s response. She’s shifts
in her seat uncomfortably.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I welcome the dead into my soul…</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: You must believe it! Stephanie takes a
deep breath and they begin the chant again. This time,, together.</p>
<p><strong>ram jaas stephanie</strong>: I welcome the dead into my I
welcome the dead into my soul… soul… Stephanie looks around the darkened
room. Shadows from the candles dance upon the walls.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: I sense something here with us.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Yes. The parlor’s crystal chandeleir
tinkles. A tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment. Stephanie’s eyes
search the room.</p>
<p><strong>something unseen</strong>: emits a wheezing breath… We hear
FOOTSTEPS as something walks on the ceiling above them.</p>
<p><strong>a man’s loud laughter</strong>: echoes about the room.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: It is not the Lamia. It is the
spirit of some unsettled soul from</p>
<p><strong>the pitcher of water</strong>: upon the table is drained.
Then the water is spat out in a stream at Milos’ face. The MAN’S
LAUGHTER again.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: Be gone, foolish spirit! There is a
HOWLING OF WIND and the room is again quiet.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: Show yourself Lamia. We invite you
into our circle. Quiet. Stephanie looks about. Nothing seems to be
happening.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: He’s coming…</p>
<p><strong>scratch. scratch.</strong>: The SCRATCHING OF FINGERNAILS on
wood. A sound that Stephanie’s heard before. It grows louder, more
distorted.</p>
<p><strong>scratch scratch!</strong>: Stephanie grips the table. And
just when the SCRATCHING SOUND is deafening… All becomes silent.
Stephanie holds her breath. A wind whips up in the room sending papers
whirling about,. yet all the windows are closed. Shaun San Dena’s eyes
roll up into her head. She emits a low and powerful MOAN. Her head
slumps onto her shoulders. Then she straightens with a new vigor.
Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as her lips move rapidly and a garbled
sound comes out of her throat. she speaks in a strange and
incomprehensible tongue.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Who now inhabits the body of Shaun San
Dena?</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: Lamia… Rham Jas nods discreetly to
Milos who quietly uncovers the slaughtering blade.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas.</strong>: Lamia, what is it that you desire? Shaun
San Dena’s chair abruptly spins about to face Stephanie. The mouth jerks
opened and closed as if controlled by a bad puppeteer. Then, out
of.sync, the demonic voice is</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: The soul of Stephanie Brownl We will
feast upon it, as she festers in the gravel</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It was my manager, Jim Jacks. He was the
one ! He–</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Silence! Lamia, please, surely we can
dissuade you from taking this insignificant woman? Surely she’s not
worthy of your greatness. The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: No! I will enjoy watching her skin
blister and pop in hell’s flame. I come for her! Stephanie quickly grabs
Shaun San Derna’s hand and places it on the goat’s head. Shaun San
Dena’s eyes clear for a moment as she struggles to regain control. Now
there are two spirits battling within her. She attempts t to force the
spirit of the Lamia from her body and into the goat. The Goat BLEATS and
bucks wildly as the spirit is transferred. Milos raises up the
slaughtering blade.</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: No! You–</p>
<p><strong>goat</strong>: –tricked me! The possessed goat emits a
terrible cry! The bone chilling SHRIEK of Lamia! It’s oval eye reflects
the blade as it descends toward it. The possessed Goat jerks aside and
the blade misses, slicing into the chair. As Milos raises the blade for
another blow, the goat bites his hand. In that moment, the spirit of the
Lamia is transferred to him. A Possessed Milos SCREAMS and spins toward
Stephanie, glaring at her with black goat eyes. He SHOUTS at her in a
gibberish of tongues! His body jerks up into the air. He dances a jig
atop the table, now laughing uncontrollably. t</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Lamial I command you to leave this– A
chair sails through the air and shatters across Rham Jas’ back, knocking
him to the ground. Milos’ body is hurled up against the chandelier,
shattering it. Glass rains down upon Stephanie. on the ceiling, Milos is
spun.about like a pin wheel. Stephanie races for the door but a .huge
bureau lurches in front of her, blocking her path. Rham Jas rouses a
stunned Shaun San Dena.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: You must banish the spirit! Shaun San Dena
places her hands on her ayes, then over her heart and chants an ancient
Gypsy incantation up toward Milos. Milos SHRIEKS. A white vapor streams
from his body as the Lamia is torn from him.</p>
<p><strong>milos</strong>: Stop the chanting. I beg you! But Shaun San
Dena only chants louder. Milos SCREAMS grow more intense as-his body
spasms in pain. Stephanie grasps at Shaun San Dena.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: For god’s sake, stop the chanting, it’s
killing him! Rham Jas pushes her aside.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: You must not stop! A withered pair of
hands reach down from above and clutch at Stephanie’s face! It is
Mrs. Ganush that now floats above her! Her long yellowed fingernails
scratching at Stephanie’s skin.</p>
<p><strong>milos/mrs. ganush</strong>: Make her stop, you dirty pork
queen!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No! Get her off! Mrs. Ganush grabs at
Stephanie’s head. Stephanie pulls away but it costs her a clump of hair
that Mrs. Ganush rips from her head. Mrs. Ganush opens her mouth… wide…
wider still… she vomits out Stephanie’s dead cat. It lands atop the
table. Stephanie screams uncontrollably. Shaun San Dena, is trembling as
her chanting comes to a climax. Mrs. Ganush changes back to the
possessed Milo. The last of the white vapor is torn from Milos body as
the spirit of the Lamia leaves him. Milos falls to the floor and all is
quiet. An ashen faced Shaun San Dena halts her chant.</p>
<p><strong>10 stephanie</strong>: Is it gone? Stephanie notices that the
cat has vanished. Was it ever there? Rham Jae kneels at Milos’ side.
He’s starting to come around. Milos stands, shaken. The Lamia is gone.
Shaun San Dena grabs at her chest, struggles for breath. Stephanie
rushes over to steady her.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Let me help you…</p>
<p><strong>shaun san dena</strong>: My heart. Shaun San Dena collapses
into Stephanie’s arms. Rham Jas moves to assist her. They lower Shaun
San Dana to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Milos, call an ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: She’s not breathing. Rham Jas attempts to
administer CPR to no avail.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: My God. My God… He checks her pulse one
last time. The CPR is finally halted. Rham Jas closes her eyes, then
touches her forehead, praying:</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Gata, gata, para gata… bodhi suaha. Gone,
gone, gone beyond. Gone beyond the beyond. Hail the goer.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It’s sad:</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Strange how things work out. She waited
years for another chance to overcome the lamia ..and finally she
did.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: No. I’m afraid you misunderstand. Rham Jas
looks at her with pity.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: The,Lamia can not’be banished by a medium.
This was our lesson tonight. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: No. You saw her drive the Lamia from the
seance. That is all. It will be back.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: But then, what am I supposed to do? Rham
Jas shrugs. He fishes in his pocket for his car keys.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Perhaps on this final evening, you should
finish up the business of this world. For before the night is through,
the Lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie’s hand</strong>: Slowly emerges from her coat
pocket. She studies the thin brass button in her palm. 0</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Unless, of course… you were no longer the
owner.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No longer the owner? I don’t understand.
Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank envelope. He
places the button within and seals it.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: The Lamia comes for the owner of the
accursed object. Just make a gift of it… To demonstrate, he hands the
envelope to Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: .and you’ve given away the curse.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me this before?!</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Because we are speaking of murder.
Stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to Rham Jas. She
places the envelope carefully into the side ’pocket of her purse. Rham
Jas tries to conceal the sadness and fear he feels for her.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Whatever you decide, you have until
sunrise.’ She nods goodbye as Ray’s car pulls up. Ray opens the door.
for her and she gets in.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is it over? Stephanie, stares at her envelope,
thinks about telling him, then…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes. It’s all over. Ray squeezes her
hand. Appreciating the two of them now more than ever. Stephanie SCREAMS
as… MRS. GANUSH.appears in the headlights, standing on the road before
them! Ray hits the breaks. The car SCREECHES to a halt! Stephanie’s
purse with the envelope and.some of Ray’s papers fall to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are you okay? Stephanie nods, catching her
breath.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: That guy came out of nowhere. Stephanie looks to
the figure in the road. Mrs. Ganush is gone. In her place is an old man
who mutters angrily at them and moves on.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are you’still okay about the Santa Barbara
trip?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yes, everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay. Our train leaves tomorrow morning. Seven
A.M. When do you want me to pick you up?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It’s better if we meet at the D station.
There’s something I’ve got to do on the way. Stephanie suddenly’
clutches at her purse. The envelope is gone!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Wait! Where’s my envelope?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What envelope? She opens the car door and
frantically rummages around the floor, through Ray’s papers.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It’s got to be here! Then, Stephanie
comes upon something under the seat. She smiles and stands. A white
envelope held tightly in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Got , it .</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Tomorrow’s gonna be a new start for, us. Don’t
be late. They kiss and Ray drives off.</p>
<p><strong>a wall clock</strong>: The time is 1:30 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: drinks coffee and stares at the white
envelope that’s tucked into the side pocket of her purse. She scans the
patrons and considers giving it to each of them, then one by one,
rejects the idea.</p>
<p><strong>a waitress</strong>: Comes by, removes a dirty dish and
refills her coffee.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Banana Boat Sundae.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Another one? Stephanie nods absently. The
waitress exits.</p>
<p><strong>the wall clock</strong>: The time is now 2:15 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>a withered old man</strong>: site alone at a table in a
wheelchair. A portable oxygen cylinder, supplying him with air.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: takes a deep breath, stands and walks to
his table.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I wonder if you could help me out? The
Old Man looks up, sees her desperation.</p>
<p><strong>old man 0</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I just need you to hang on to this
envelope for me. Just until tomorrow. She extends the envelope to him.
He hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Just take the envelope and I’ll explain.
Please. The Old Man considers. He reaches for the envelope when an OLD
WOMAN, his wife, hobbles toward the table. The Old Man helps her sit and
puts away her cane. They turn to Stephanie who withdraws the
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Never mind. Stephanie returns to her
seat, ashamed at what she almost did. She returns the envelope to the
purse pocket, racking her brains, trying to think of some way out of
this. Her gaze lands upon a stack of newspapers on the next table. She
grabs the paper and finds the OBITUARIES.</p>
<p><strong>close on the newspaper:</strong>: MRS. GANUSH’S OBITUARY: A
photo of the old woman. The location of the burial is listed: Oakwood
Cemetary. Stephanie rips the listing from the paper and rushes from the
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well? Is it possible? 0</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: There are Gypsy blessings that are
bestowed upon the dead… And the Gypsies give gifts to their departed to
curry favor with the deceased soul. Yes. I do believe you could give the
curse to someone who has passed on… for truly, the soul never dies.</p>
<p><strong>close on stephanie</strong>: As she drives we hear the voice
over from the preceding</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: .but you must make a formal gift of the
cursed object to the deceased.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Formal gift… ? Car headlights sweep over
her grim face. She fingers the envelope, then glances to the seat next
to her… a SHOVEL.</p>
<p><strong>rham jas</strong>: Give it to the corpse personally. Put it
in their hand… their’ pocket…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Oh, I’ll do better than that… CAMERA
moves in tight.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: .I’ll shove it down her goddamn throat.
She zips up her raincoat. SOMETHING flits past the window. Too.quick
to.see. Then it reappears. It’s Mrs. Ganush’s hankie. It.flies against
Stephanie’s windshield and gets caught on the wiper blade. Stephanie
GASPS. It flaps in the wind, blocking her view. Stephanie hits the wiper
button. The hankie is yanked-back and forth across the windshield.</p>
<p><strong>long shot - crashed car</strong>: Stephanie pulls herself
from the crash. She glances up to a flash of lightning. It illuminates:
The wrought iron gates of the OAKWOOD CEMETERY. A hill of tombstones
beyond.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: LATER - It’s raining harder. The hole
Stephanie digs is now several feet deep.</p>
<p><strong>clunk</strong>: The shovel has hit the buried coffin. The
rain intensifies.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: LATER - Mud is pouring down the sides
of the grave. In the bottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the
simple pine casket. She jams the shovel blade between two boards and
pries off the coffin’s top and shoves it aside. A lightning flash
illuminates the corpse. Mrs. Ganush’s white eye is open and staring at
Stephanie. Stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from
her coat.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’m giving it back to you. She grabs
Mrs. Ganush’s hand and tries to get her clenched fist to open, but rigor
morris has locked it shut. Stephanie pulls with all her might,
causing…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ganush’s corpse</strong>: to lurch up and out of the
coffin. Her dead arms, thrown forward from the momentum, wrap around
Stephanie. Stephanie SCREAMS! The withered face leers! Stephanie pushes
the corpse away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the
mud.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You’ll take it, all right… She picks up
the shovel and jams the blade into the old woman’s mouth, wedging it
between her teeth. She pries the jaw open. Mud and rivulets of water
begin pouring down into the grave from all sides. The body of
Mrs. Ganush is quickly being re-buried.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I, Stephanie Brown, do hereby make a
formal gift of this button to you, Sylvia Ganush. She jams the white
envelope down the old woman’s throat.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Choke on it, bitch. She kicks the old
woman’s jaw.. It SNAPS shut, trapping the envelope between her broken
teeth. Muddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs..
Ganush’s face. It covers everything, except the jutting envelope and a
single, staring white eye. Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls
are too slick. She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it
tears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up to her
armpits.</p>
<p><strong>the head of mrs. ganush</strong>: Bobs up, through the mud.
The Old Woman is grinning, with the envelope still jammed between her
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>long shot - the grave</strong>: Rivers of muddy water now
pour in from every direction. It has become the drain hole of the
cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>the influx of mud</strong>: pushes the old woman corpse
against Stephanie. Her grinning face led mashed against Stephanie’s
cheek. Stephanie’s SCREAM is cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear
beneath the mud. The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA
STARTS TO PULL AWAY when…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie’s hand</strong>: rips up through the mud, grasping
the tree root.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie’s head</strong>: Breaks the surface of the mud,
sucking in air. She claws her way out, then staggers away, through the
pouring rain.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks’ voice</strong>: Stephanie. It’s Jim. Jim Jacks.
Sorry I’m calling so early– but Last night I found some troubling
information about our friend Stu Rubin…</p>
<p><strong>mr. jacks’ voice</strong>: Apparently he stole your file on 4
the Mcpherson loan and then tried to broker his own deal at First
Federal. I guess he thought we wouldn’t find out. When I confronted him
he broke down crying and well, we won’t be seeing him around
anymore.</p>
<p>****: It looks like the loan’s coming back to us. And I just wanted
you to know that come Monday morning, that assistant manager’s position
will be waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>a mrs. fields representative</strong>: holds a platter of
freshly baked cookies and offers free samples to passersby. One is
offered to Stephanie. She politely declines as she walks past with a
bounce in her step.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hey! Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: I’m sorry, we’re not open yet.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Please. I know what I want. That coat in
the window. The Saleswoman considers.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: My boyfriend and I are taking a very
special trip this morning. Stephanie’s smile is bright. Her joy is
contagious. The Saleswoman relents and lets Stephanie in.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Ray! Ray embraces her and grabs her
luggage. A TRAIN WHISTLE sounds as the train approaches.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m so glad you’re here. There’s so much I’ve
been meaning to tell you. 0 She takes his hand. 0</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: But let me say this first while I have it
straight in my head. You never stopped believing in me. I’ll try and
live up to that. They share an intimate moment. A romantic kiss. He
breaks off and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did I tell you, you look great?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Thanks. Stephanie models her new
coat.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You like it? It’s brand new.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’d you do with your old coat? Just the
mention of it, makes her face darken.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I got rid of it. I never want to see it
again.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Too bad,’cause I just found this. Ray produces
the envelope. And from it, withdraws… THE</p>
<p><strong>cursed button!</strong>: CAMERA RACES INTO A HUGE CLOSE UP OF
THE BUTTON with a terrible CLASHING of symbols!. Stephanie can’t
breathe.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, it was in my car. Hey, have you seen my
Indian Head nickel? I put it in an envelope just like this one.
Stephanie stares at the button, shaking her head in disbelief. The
RUMBLING of the approaching train builds on the sound track.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What? What is it? She backs away in horror, but
Ray follows her with the button still in his hand. The RUMBLING grows
louder. She’s backing up toward the edge of the platform.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stephanie. Stop! Ray steps forward, still
holding out the button. Stephanie SHRIEKS as she falls backwards, off
the platform and onto the tracks. In her last moment of life, she turns
her head to see…</p>
<p><strong>the oncoming train</strong>: Racing at her! Through the
swirling smoke, the engine’s mechanical face, resembles the goat like
face of the demon Lamia. It VOMITS STEAM as it angrily bares down upon
her.</p>
<p><strong>the train whistle shrieks!</strong>: Stephanie recognizes the
sound. It’s a cry she’s heard before. In every door creak… in every cold
night wind… a haunting, soulless sound… the cry of Lamia. Ray races to
the edge of the platform. The two lover’s eyes find each other one last
time. Stephanie SCREAMS as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her down
into hell.</p>
<p><strong>the people on the platform</strong>: Believe they have
witnessed a train accident but Ray knows the truth. He looks to…</p>
<p><strong>the button</strong>: still in his hand.</p>
