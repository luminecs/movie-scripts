protect the girl…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Did he harm the girl?</p>
<p><strong>lurch</strong>: Hell, he probably raped her in the lot,
dumped the body somewhere. That’s what he was like - a real wacko.</p>

<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: I’m sorry. I heard about last
night.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: I heard Doyle went off on you. I don’t
know if I like that some-bitch too much. MARVOSA He’s not used to the
way we do things. Well, you know, he’s from the 77th. Coming here,
trying to be a hard-ass, trying to prove himself.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Marvosa!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Come with me!</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: Don’t you take any shit from him.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: I don’t take shit from anyone, Meadows. You
know that.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: What did the six-toes have to say?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on
her own.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It
doesn’t rule out foul play.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing
60 miles away in some dive bar?</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: I don’t know, shit. Maybe she was looking
for love…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah - funny. There’s something else I don’t
understand…I still wanna know why Fleming was up in Malibu last
night.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Find out for me.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Captain there’s someone here to see you -
he’s waiting in your office.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I don’t know - but he’s from the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: INT DOYLE’S OFFICE - DAY</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Captain Doyle?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Special Agent Craig, FBI.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Your department contacted our agency
regarding information on Sarah Williams.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Not on her. But as for Jim Trudell… do you
mind if I close the door?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at
Sergeant Zydowski’s request. He’s 31, no priors, and he’s been working
for the military for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We ran the i.d. I could have told you
that.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I don’t think you understand. I don’t mean
shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified
assignments, special forces…sabotage…until last year. He was brought up
on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he
sprang the service.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You
saying he has an agenda down here?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Our agency monitors all threats very
carefully, and there’s good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the
training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat
to the public if he remains at large.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If what you’re saying is true, then why would
he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay
low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s the point. He slipped up, and he’s
desperate now. And that means he’s all the more dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m sure if our departments cooperate we can
find out the truth.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Cooperate?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Every step of the way.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If you guys want in, fine. Just remember this
is our jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Captain we got a store owner in Venice,
made a stone-cold ID of Trudell about fifteen minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Goddamn he made it into Venice! OK we’re back
on the road! Notify all units, tell them we’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Let’s roll -</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Right behind you.</p>

<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If you can trail him to a remote area do it.
We all want a piece of him but let’s keep our heads and stay within the
law - we got people everywhere out here.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: These crowds are going to make it a
bitch!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I’m sure you can handle it. Now I want to do
an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from
Marine to 30th. Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: I’ll take the south end -</p>

<p><strong>jim</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven’t seen you in
eight years, you show up to my door like you’re on drugs - now the least
you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Two cops are dead.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And?…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I killed them.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don’t know about all
this! You sure?!</p>

walked in on something, I don’t know what -</p>

late -</p>

<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Oh man…what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know. But I’m in trouble. I’m all over

<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Alright…alright…you’ve saved my ass enough
times. What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I hope you haven’t lost your touch with this
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Shit, what I have now made our setup in
Angola look like Tinker Toys. I’ve been skipping through Internal
Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to
check it out?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ve got a better idea…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: OK…where do you want to start?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: With a girl named Sarah Williams…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: OK, I’m logged on to the municipal network.
I’m showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.
None of them live in Hollywood. Do you remember the address?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: 1490…Breckinridge…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Let’s see what we got…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Donut?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No thanks. How do you know they can’t catch you
on this thing?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: I don’t, but I’m pretty sure. It’s a long
story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and
sent it through the phone network mainframe. If they start a trace it
will be to a Pic’n’Save on Pico.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I knew I could count on you.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: I got a lot of free time, you know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: OK…county tax records…they’re saying 1490
Breckinridge is owned by… an Atlantic Trust Corporation…they have a P.O.
box in D.C.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How about Marvosa and the others?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: I’ll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta
be careful - that one’s kind of tricky -</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: So…what happened to you, Jimmy? I figure
you’d be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the
good old days.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I gave all that up. I got tired of the lies.
They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched
assignment. It got so I didn’t know who to trust anymore… …some things
never change, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You know this time, there’s nobody that’s
gonna cover your ass. You’re over your head this time.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What else is new?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: OK–I’ve got something here…personnnel

<p><strong>zydowski</strong>: Well read this -</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Something I don’t already know?</p>
<p><strong>zydowski</strong>: Well it’s just kind of a coincidence,
isn’t it? Stanton and Fleming, both started in ’83, both in area
six…both in Vice?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Vice…you think they had something to do with
this dead hooker?</p>
<p><strong>zydowski</strong>: Could explain why Fleming was there.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Forget it. This hooker’s a red herring. Even
the FBI came up short -</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Speak of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: They found the getaway Mercedes a parking
garage north of Venice. It checks out.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Good! We’ll get it to the nearest outlying
station and hold it for prints - we’re on our way - You coming?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’ll let you two handle it…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And where the hell is Marvosa?</p>

<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: D.T’s shit-canned. So’s Droopy. The other
two will live.</p>
<p><strong>ulysses</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: I don’t know if she hired him or what -
he’s damn good. And he’s already fucking everything up, we could chop
enough Benzes tonight to pick up half a million. To add to it I got this
gung-ho son-of-a-bitch captain outta Compton snooping around - nothing’s
good!!! We got to get rid of this guy!</p>
<p><strong>ulysses</strong>: We will - are you willing to take it all
the way? If you want pros it’s gonna cost…</p>

down! It’s just the price of doing business…</p>

<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Our getaway car. You said a cell phone?</p>
<p><strong>zydowsky</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That might just be our ticket.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>zydowski</strong>: Maybe Jim Trudell called someone from the
car.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: He’d have to be really stupid to pull that.
I mean - he must have known we would find the car.</p>
<p><strong>zydowski</strong>: Maybe…but it would be even stupider not to
check it out.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Get the information for us. Call the phone
company, find out what calls were made on this extension over the last
48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: It’s safe to assume that this guy has some
kind of weapon on him…</p>
<p><strong>zydowsky</strong>: Well he had quite a selection to choose
from. The question is - who’s his next target?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Marvosa–when did you join the force?</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: When did you join the force? You know, the
police force, the place you work…</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Nineteen eighty four. What fucking
difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Did you start out area six?</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: So you must have known Fleming… and Stanton
-</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Yeah I saw ’em around. They worked
vice.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well don’t you think that’s odd?</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: It’s kind of a funny coincidence, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Gotta come from somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where do you come from, Marvosa?</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Traffic…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Just wondering if maybe they had a thing
going with this hooker, you know, some connection.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Hey what they did on their time was their
business, you know? I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he
is.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: LAPD data center reports a breach on the
system. An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and
Stanton…and yours too, Marvosa.</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Outside hacker? What the fuck are you
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That’s got to our secret agent man! Do we
have an address?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yeah -</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Alright, I want SWAT on that building right
away. Let’s get down there and find out what the hell is going on.</p>

know?</p>

rest…you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>

<p><strong>jim</strong>: Both at the same bank…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And look at the balances…these aren’t police

<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hello, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hands in the air.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I understand there’s a lot of people
looking for you. I know how that can feel. CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why did you set me up?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I didn’t. I figured you leave it well
enough alone.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well you figured wrong! And now I’m public
enemy number one. You have an answer for that?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I had to get away! My life was in
danger!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: No. A witness.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What exactly did you see?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Six months ago, a police lieutenant named
Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out
- left no note, you may have heard of it…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, but I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I was there, and it was no suicide. He
was killed by professionals. I was in the bathroom when it happened.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Didn’t these - professionals - figure he had a
girl in the room?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Yeah…they did. One girl…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Charlie Fletcher liked to move around a
lot, but he was a regular. And he paid for the kink.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I had to call another appointment and
cancel. Fletcher wanted to party all night, and he made it worth my
while. But then I heard the front door open…and I heard voices…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What the hell are you doing here!</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: Stomping a pigeon.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: You’re done rocking the boat Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Jesus!!! Don’t kill me - please!!</p>
<p><strong>marvosa</strong>: You’re gonna take care of that!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Let go! Aaaahhh–</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It seemed like I waited for ever before
coming out, and when I did I saw them.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: They were dead. No struggle, no commotion
- just dead.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I got out of there. I just grabbed up my
stuff, and then I found it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Found what?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I was grabbing up everything I had when I
noticed something behind the curtain.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: It seems Charlie liked to watch. Over and
over.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I had it all on tape…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What did you do then?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I didn’t know what to do - but I knew I
had something somebody would want. That’s where I met him - told him
what I had. The FBI set me up with a new place…but the cops found me
somehow. So I ran…and met you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What happened with the tape?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I took it with me. It’s in a safe
place.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all
of them.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yes. They were using the city resources to
steal and fence luxury cars, then making sure the thefts weren’t
followed up. It’s a very lucrative business nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And you just did nothing?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: At first I didn’t know. We were waiting for
the right time to act. Fortunately Stephanie had the good sense to do
the right thing. Unfortunately for you, I received a better offer.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Like I said…it’s a very lucrative
business.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You want to make your best move? Go
ahead…just give me a reason…</p>

out the window. Go ahead!</p>
