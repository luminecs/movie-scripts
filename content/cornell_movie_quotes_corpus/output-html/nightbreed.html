<p><strong>voice</strong>: We did not always live in hiding.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But the Naturals made war on us. They feared
us for our strength. They envied our powers. They called us monsters,
killing us by whatever means their malice could invent, finding in each
of us our particular vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: None of us was safe. The tribes of the moon
dwindled. Our gods were slaughtered, our homes destroyed. It was the
Apocalypse.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust.
Baphomet. Wounded and near death, he summoned us, the last of the last,
into hiding. Into Midian, where we wait now. The battle is over but not
the war. There will come a saviour.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: His name is Cabal. He will lead and give us
back the Night. We are the tribes of the moon. We are the
Nightbreed.</p>
<p><strong>shuna</strong>: Come…</p>
<p><strong>shuna</strong>: Will you not come?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone…wake up.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Hi. You OK?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You want something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Sure. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Nine-thirty. I was letting you doze.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Thought you’d worn me out, huh?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: We should get out of Calgary for a few days.
Just take off.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Anywhere special?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Somewhere we can be alone together.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: More alone than this?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Yeah. Just you and me. No work. No telephone
calls. No…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I know. I always know. It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’m going around in some crazy loop in my
head.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You’re not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Say it like you mean it.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I believe it. I’m not crazy. But I want this
damn dream out of my head.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Decker’s started calling me again.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: All last week. Every day.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t called him back.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: If he can help, see him. Tell him it’s all
gone but the bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: They’re not bad. That’s what’s weird. The
more I have them the more I like them. Now I do sound like a crazy,
right?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No. You sound like the man I love. A little
haunted, maybe, but the sanest man I ever met.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Will you see Decker?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You think I should?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Where’s the harm? You tell him from me, I’m
the only thing you should be dreaming about.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I don’t think he’d get it. He never had a wet
dream in his life.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I don’t want to be competing with things I
can’t see, Boone. Can’t share I don’t want to be always feeling that
something’s pulling at you.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’m not going anywhere, Lori. Except with
you.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I can’t hear that often enough.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’ll never leave you. Not ever. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Can’t remember a time when I didn’t love
you.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: How about before we met?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Even then.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Okay, you want ham, cheese, pickle,
mustard?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: All of the above and a brewski, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: You’re getting porky, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou two</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Sweetie, you’re supposed to be
beddy-bye.</p>
<p><strong>lou two</strong>: I heard something.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>lou two</strong>: Bad man.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: No, everything’s okay. You go back to bed,
munchkin, I’ll be up to see you in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: How’s that sandwich coming?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Coming…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Melissa?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh God - GOD!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Same profile?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Unmistakable. Doesn’t miss a trick.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: If it’s any comfort, they went quickly.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Yeah. Makes me feel a whole lot better about
the sick fuck.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Find this guy, Joyce. They say these guys
want to be caught. I think this one likes it too much.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’ve been listening to the tapes of our
sessions. All two years’ worth…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Most of my colleagues would have walked away
from a case like yours. The most they would have done was drug you. But
you…you intrigued me. All the talk of monsters. And Midian. Remember
Midian?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: That wasn’t me. I heard about Midian from
other people.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: But you made it part of your private
mythology.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I suppose I did. It was a place of
refuge.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: When you imagined yourself being taken off
to this invented city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be
forgiven?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You know what I used to dream.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Yes. There’s a remarkable consistency in the
images you see. Great detail. Almost as though the violence was
real.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: They were just bad dreams. Midian doesn’t
exist. Monsters don’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: But murder does, Boone. Murder’s very real.
It may start in the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and
blood.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Didn’t what?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: They were bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: What you describe in your sessions is very
specific. Houses; faces…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You want to hear?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Six families killed over a two year period.
All within driving distance of Calgary…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I hope to God you didn’t, for both our
sakes. We’ve come a long way together. I don’t want to believe this any
more than you do.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: But you do.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I wouldn’t put us through this pain if I
didn’t…if I wasn’t…afraid you had.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I can only go so far on your behalf. Patient
confidentiality’s one thing. Protecting a killer is another.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Listen to me. Take these, they’ll help. Go
home, and consider what we’ve talked about. I’m going to give you
twenty-four hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your
own accord. That’s as long as I can give you. if you haven’t complied by
then, I’m afraid I’ll have to tell them what I know.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’ll never leave you…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: There’s a cheerful thought. I don’t know what
kind of fuel he’s using, but this guy’s cruising at about 35,000
feet.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You don’t hit that altitude on lithium
carbonate. Let’s get the prescribing doctor on the line… Okay, we’re
doing all right, aren’t we? Tell me, what’ve you been taking tonight,
partner?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Lithium…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Lithium? This isn’t lithium, my friend.
Let’s move him. Observation, let’s get an IV, valium/saline, 200
milligrams percodan for pain, as needed… We’ll have to call this in.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What was I taking?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Shit! I’ve missed them, I’ve missed them!
You scared them off, you kept them from me!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: I said shut up, you want to ruin
everything?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What did you say, just now?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You said Midian.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: It’s where the monsters go. It takes away
the pain…</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Uh-huh. Ever kill anybody?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: See, they only take you if you’re worthy.
You know what they do to those that aren’t worthy?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: It’s real. Midian’s real. And you know…where
it is. Don’t you? We could go there…</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: They sent you. They sent you to take
me.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: That’s right. But first I need to know…you
have to tell me…where it is.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: It’s a test? No maps.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: But you do know. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Show me what?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: My true face. That’s what there are for.
So you can see. I’m not a natural man. Underneath I’m a monster, that’s
how it works; I show you, then you take me with you…</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Fucking junkies! Doctor!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Let’s get some help in here!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: He’s talking but he’s not making any sense.
Something about a place called Midian.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: He’s dying. I think he wants to die.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’ll do my best. But I’ll need privacy.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No….oh no… No!</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: I got him.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Midian? Are you from Midian?</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: We should take him below, Peloquin.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: He’s not Nightbreed. He’s Natural.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No! I’ve killed people, I’m like you, that’s
why I’m here…</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Shut the fuck up. You’re meat.</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: If we eat him we break the Law.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: My God…my God, it’s true …</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Of course it’s true. Everything’s true …
God’s an astronaut. Oz is over the rainbow. And Midian’s where the
monsters live. And you came to die.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I didn’t…didn’t come to die. I came to be
with you, I’m one of you.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: No. Sorry. I can smell innocence at fifty
yards.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’ve killed people. Fifteen people.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: He lied, asshole. He lied. You’re a
Natural. And that means…you’re meat for the Beast.</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: We mustn’t. It’s the Law. They’ll exile
us…</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Fuck the Law! I want meat!</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: Peloquin, no!</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Damn you!</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: That way! The gate’s that way!</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: He’s gone, give it up! You don’t dare go out
there!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Freeze! Right there!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Boone, listen to him, it’s no use!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You…you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You wouldn’t hurt a fly. Come on, Boone.
It’s safe, I’ve seen to that.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: They weren’t tranquillizers…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: He’s got a gun!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Lori, I’m Dr Decker. Boone was my
patient.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Yes. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’m so sorry for your loss. I must tell you,
you meant the world to Aaron. He spoke of you constantly …</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Miss Winston, are you sure you wouldn’t
rather postpone…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No. Let’s get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: How long had you known Aaron Boone?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Two months.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Deceased is a white Caucasian male, late
twenties. Suspected cause of death, multiple gunshot wounds to the
thoracic cavity and extremities.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Jesus. They weren’t takin’ any
chances.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Wound number one: entered between the fourth
and fifth left ribs, impacted the lower rib, lodging in ligaments
adjacent to the left lung …</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: So he never gave any indication …</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Surely there must have been something …</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Miss Winston, everyone has their secret
faces …</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Drop dead.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: We’ll continue this some other time.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Coffee break.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Miss Winston, I hope you didn’t misinterpret
what I said. Boone meant a great deal to me …</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Where did he die? What was the name of the
town?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: A place called Midian.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Someone’s taken him…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What’ll it be, darlin’?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: A draft and some information please.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’re not the first.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Had a bunch of TV news folks passin’
through, since they nailed that baby-slasher up there.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Baby-slasher?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Yeah, hell of a week for us. The rodeo
this weekend. That scumbag gets blown away. I hear it took thirty slugs
to bag that sucker. Just goes to show you, don’t it? People love a
spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Where’s the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Right around the corner there,
darlin’.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Which is it, hon’, men or money? It’s
usually one or the other, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Oh……A man.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Uh-huh. What’d he do, leave?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Jesus, did he come back? That’s even
worse.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Can’t argue with that, Can I buy you a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Hell, yes you can. Better than gettin’ hit
on by some damn buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: They think some sick bastard’s stole the
body.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: So you want to go check out the place in
which he checked out?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Yeah. Guess it’s a way to say goodbye, you
know? He was always a mystery to me. I loved him…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Tell you what, Lori, why don’t I drive up
there to this Medium place with you tomorrow and keep you company?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You don’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Yeah, but I’m goin’ to and I don’t want no
argument from you.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You get some rest, sugar. I’m gonna stay
down here and close this damn bar. Maybe one of these lunkheads’ll win
the lottery.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Courtesy of that gent in the suit at the
end of the bar.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: You’ll like this. No, really. It’s just
their way of welcoming you to the club.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’m not sure I want to be a member.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: You made your way back here for the same
reasons I did. We belong here now. There’s nowhere else on earth would
take us in.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Shuna Sassi. Why?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I dreamt her.</p>
<p><strong>shuna sassi</strong>: I’ve dreamt him.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Who is your advocate?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Have you tutored him in the Law?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Yes he has.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Let the advocate answer.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Yes I have.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: You understand what you do, becoming one
of us? With this night you turn your back on the Natural World. The life
you lived will after this be as a dream.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: The blood of the God tells all truths. It
can harm as easily as heal. Are you prepared to be judged?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Be judged.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Aaron Boone, in the name of Baphomet,
Lord of the tribes of the moon, I bid you welcome…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hair of the dog.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: How’s your head?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: My momma always used to say, ‘Sheryl Ann,
there’s a man out walking around with your name on his mind, all you got
to do is run into him.’</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: And he just happened to be checked in here at
the crossroads of the world.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Isn’t that something? His name is Curtis, he
is a banker, recently divorced and recently relocated in Edmonton, up
for the rodeo and better yet, he thinks I am the Queen-bee’s knees.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Sheryl, you sure you want to come along?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Wouldn’t miss it. Besides, Curtis has to do
business today, we’ve got an engagement for this evening and if I sit
around all day with this head on I’m gonna feel like the hind end of a
dog sled.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I’m glad for your company.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Now if we could just make a quick stop for
some Alka-Seltzer.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Jesus. Looks like the gold rush is over.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: To get away from it all? Shut up, Sheryl
Ann. You go do what you have to do. I’ll stay here and…do somethin’
else.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Good God…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Curtis … what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Bring her. Bring her, please.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: …I’m afraid it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No…she can’t die. Bring her to me,
please.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Pay no attention. Please, bring me my
Babette.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t look! Don’t look!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Jesus! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Babette…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: What…what…what the…?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She likes to play outside. I tell her: you
mustn’t play in the sun. The sun will hurt you. But she’s just a child.
She doesn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: This is too weird.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You must go, this place is not for you.
Midian is a home for the Nightbreed. Only for the Nightbreed.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Is Boone here? Did somebody bring him
here?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Rachel…you have said too much
already.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: My Lylesburg, she brought me Babette, she
saved her . . .</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: We know. But you cannot help her.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: The child has no life to save, But what
she has is yours, if you want it. That’s the Law. Do you want her?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No! I just want some answers.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: You weren’t meant to see this.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I kind of got that impression.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Then you also understand that to speak of
this to anyone will bring dire consequences . . .</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Hey, pal, don’t threaten me.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Not for you. For us.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Wait! Wait a minute! Boone, Aaron Boone, just
tell me, is he here? You took him, you took his body, didn’t you?
Hey!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Come back!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Okay. Walk away, Lori. Don’t panic. There’s
got to be a perfectly reasonable explanation, And hell if I know what it
is.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Sheryl! Sheryl! Let’s get the hell out of
here! Sheryl?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Sheryl, we have to go, uh, something’s kind of
come up and…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Let’s get it over with, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Good question. No reason why you shouldn’t
have an answer. Wish I had a camera. Oh, the look a your face.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Why? Why did you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Why did I kill all the others? For the fun
of it, of course. For pleasure. Everyone ought to have a hobby, don’t
you agree?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone was innocent.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Is innocent, wherever he’s hiding. After all
the trouble I went to to find him a home for his guilt.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You sick motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Boone’s alive, Lori. And your death is going
to bring him out of hiding.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I have to help her!</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: You can’t go.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’ll kill him. No-one will ever know.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: What’s below remains below.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I can’t let her die.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: When we took you in you made an oath to
obey the Law.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I won’t listen to him butcher her. I love
her.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: She’s a Natural. She couldn’t love you
back. Not now.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Wrong!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You’re wrong!</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Boone! Boone!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Help me! Oh please, God, somebody.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: That’s good. Be still. It’s quicker that
way.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You? Here again?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Isn’t this where the dead are supposed to
go?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You’re not dead.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’m not Decker!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No? Isn’t that you, Dr Decker, hiding behind
that child’s mask?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’m not hiding…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: That’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Not just dead…changed. A monster. Want me to
show you?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Not your kind of monster. Not the soulless
kind. I’ve got Midian in my veins.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Please, please, it’s, it’s not my fault,
it’s the mask, it makes me do things I don’t want to… Boone, it was the
mask and they were going to find me, punish me, I needed a
scapegoat…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You chose the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Man? You call yourself a man?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Monster, then.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: That’s more like it. Well, go on, are you
going to kill him or not? Only I want his balls. And his eyes. That is,
if you don’t want them.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Remember me, Doctor? I was dying when you
had your way with me. You made me tell my secrets when I was feeling
particularly vulnerable. Now was that a nice thing for a doctor to
do?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Let’s start with his eyes …</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Just…keeping her warm.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: You’ve put us all in danger for your love
of this woman.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Decker can’t tell anyone. What’s he going to
say? That he tried to kill a girl and a dead man stopped him?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: He can still lead our enemies here. If he
goes - if Midian’s unearthed � you’re responsible.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: So let me make amends.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Just take the girl and go on your way
amongst the Naturals. That’s the Law.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Who made this Law?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Baphomet. The God in Obsidian. Who made
Midian.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: So maybe I should speak to this guy.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Baphomet is a spirit in stone. He doesn’t
speak, or move. His wounds are too great…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What are you afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: What Baphomet made he has the power to
unmake. His blood is volatile. He mustn’t be angered.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Then I’ll make nice.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone…?</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Be still. It was a bad hurt he did us.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Us? What do you mean ‘us’?</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: I felt your hurt. I still feel it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She even knew you were coming here. She saw
it all, through your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: And you can see through mine.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You got that right. One minute I’m about to
get carved like a Christmas turkey, the next I’m…I’m……God…it was
Boone…Boone saved me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: But he’s dead, I saw him in the morgue…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You still don’t understand, do you?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Wait a second, back up…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re below now. With the Nightbreed. The
last survivors of the great tribes.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Tribes of who? What?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We’re shapeshifters; freaks; remains of
races your species have almost driven to extinction.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: So you’re not immortal?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Far from it. The sun can kill some of us.
Like Babette. She follows her father in that. Some of us could be shot
down; others would survive that because they’ve got beyond death.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Horrible. It’s all horrible.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: To be able to fly? To be smoke, or a wolf;
to know the night, and live in it forever? That’s not so bad. You call
us monsters, but when you dream, it’s of flying and changing, and living
without death. You envy us. And what you envy…</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Be with me.</p>
<p><strong>head inquisitor</strong>: Thou shalt not suffer a monster to
live…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We are all that remain.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: And…and you’re saying…Boone’s like you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He is Nightbreed. Or he was, until he broke
the Law.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Don’t go…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: But he didn’t kill anybody, it wasn’t him,
he’s innocent…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That no longer matters…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Where is he? Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Down to the Tabernacle, to Baphomet.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The Baptiser. Who made Midian. Who called us
here and saved us from our enemies…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Take me there, I’ve got to find Boone…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: We’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Decker? This better be good.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I found Boone.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Someone brought the corpse down here?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: He’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I saw him pumped full of bullets.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: So did I. But he’s alive. He killed
again…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: In Shere Neck?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: No, out at Midian.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Why’d he go back there?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: What are you doing in my office?</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: This is Inspector Joyce. Calgary Police
Department.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: We don’t need any city boys on the case.
Midian’s under my jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: We can work together.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: No we don’t. I’ll bring him in myself.
This is my town.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: He’s not alone anymore.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Yeah. I heard that talk. That’s nuthouse
talk.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Talk about what?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Midian’s not empty. There’s something
breeding there. Below the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Yes I do. And if you don’t stop them there’s
going to be more bloodshed. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone?</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: No-one here of that name.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Told you!</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: I know you. He talks about you. Lori.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Nice. You’re still a Natural. Want to join
the family?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: You may go no further.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I want Boone!</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: You’re not to blame, but you must
understand: what Boone’s done has put us in jeopardy…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No problem, you tell me where he is and we’re
outta here…</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Boone has gone to Baphomet. He is beyond
recall.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Where is he? He’s down here isn’t he? You want
to stop me you’re gonna have to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Up and about already?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Keep away from me.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: I’m sorry about upstairs. I see a pretty
face and I want to kiss it. Don’t go down there.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone went this way, right?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: And won’t be coming back.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I’ll bring him.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: You think love can raise the dead?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: He’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: He’s that and more. If you don’t believe
me, you wait ’til he gets to sniff a little blood. That’ll bring out the
beast in him. I’m telling you, don’t go…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I have to. Nothing makes any sense without
him.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Sense? Who needs it?</p>
<p><strong>ohnaka</strong>: Hey, Ghost! Hey, Slaughter! Come and get me!
Come and get me!</p>
<p><strong>ohnaka</strong>: Fat-asses!</p>
<p><strong>ohnaka</strong>: Missed!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Where’s Boone?</p>
<p><strong>ohnaka</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone? Boone!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Don’t…don’t look…</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Well, well…</p>
<p><strong>shuna sassi</strong>: I dreamt him. He’s strong.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: That’s only because the bite was mine.</p>
<p><strong>shuna sassi</strong>: No, don’t you see? He’s the one from
the prophesies. Cabal. The seventh saviour.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: So why’s he leaving?</p>
<p><strong>shuna sassi</strong>: Everything has its purpose. Maybe he
hasn’t learned to hate his tribe enough. He’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Why die waiting?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No, no, I belong here…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Lori…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: They don’t need you. Nobody needs you but me.
We’ll go away, far away, where no-one will ever find us. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I’ll get my stuff, I’ll be back in two
minutes…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Don’t leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Why is it so empty?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: They must be at the rodeo.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I smell blood.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: So much blood…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: It was Decker…Decker did this…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Stay away from me…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I don’t want you to see…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Get out! Do as I say!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I won’t leave you…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Oh my God…oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No…No…</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: In here!</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Fuckin’ freak! Fuckin’ cannibal! Stand him
up!</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: You still here?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’m going back to Midian with you.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: I’m not going anywhere. We got press folks
and photographers coming in from all over. Wouldn’t be polite to keep
’em waiting.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Tell him. We got our man under lock and
key.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Don’t trust him. He…he…changes. I’ve seen
him.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: I’ll keep an eye out.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: He was right about the motel.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: So maybe there are more of them…</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Monsters?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Killers. A cult. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: You want to take some of the boys, take
’em Pettine?</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Yes, Sir -</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: You, Tommy and Gibbs, take the Inspector
out to the cemetery. Dig around. If you find anything with more two
eyes, holler. I got photographers wanting me…</p>
<p><strong>labowitz</strong>: Doctor’s here to examine you, freak. Just
so nobody can say we laid a finger on you… Looks okay to me, what do you
think, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>dr rose</strong>: No pulse.</p>
<p><strong>labowitz</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dr rose</strong>: No…pulse.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Yes he may have had accomplices but I
can’t reveal the precise source of my information on that…</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: Local source, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Has Boone made a confession?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: We found him with a piece of human flesh
in his mouth. How’s that for guilty?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Just exactly how many bullets did they put
into this geek up at Midian?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: As I told you, these aren’t ordinary people.
You’re saying he should be dead?</p>
<p><strong>dr rose</strong>: No, I’m saying he is dead.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Not lying down dead, friend. Walkin’
around in my fucking cell dead. Now what about that?</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: Can you hear me? They’ll find a way to
kill you, you know that? Can’t fight the darkness. Not when it’s inside
you. Are you listening? You’re an abomination, Boone. You have to die.
There’s lots of ways. I’ve read about them. Seen them when I sleep.
Horrible. HEAR ME?</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: Have you got a God, Boone? Any God’ll do.
I had one, but…he doesn’t listen any more. I ask him to take the dreams
away but they keep coming. Blood and fire. Like the end of the
world…</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Lori?</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Please, do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Be with me…be with me…</p>
<p><strong>lori/babette</strong>: …where am I? What’s happening to
me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What is it, child?</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Lori! Comeback!</p>
<p><strong>lori/babette</strong>: Is this real?</p>
<p><strong>lori/babette</strong>: I’ve brought her, to see. She’s in me.
Babette breaks away, Rachel tries to catch hold, Babette runs. P.O.V.
camera veers around and down through the maze of Midian.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Christ, you could hide a fuckin’ army in
here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What egg-zactly are we lookin’ for,
Sarge?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well what if they engage us? What about
that?</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: There’s people down there, I can feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why don’t we just shoot ‘em in their graves?
Save us diggin’ new ones,</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: We want prisoners, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: There’s something down there all right.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: If that’s the case we’ll call for
back-up…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, lookee what we got here…</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Shit. Don’t look so tough to me.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Want we should interrogate it,
Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: What the hell for?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: God damn it! There’s something wrong with
him…</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: We want answers, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Back off, Gibbs!</p>
<p><strong>lori/babette</strong>: The light…</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Shit! Shit! Get it off me! Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No way, man!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Oh my God…oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Lori, don’t leave, please don’t leave
me.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Jesus…d’you see that fucker’s face?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: It was the sun. The sun did it.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Christ on a crutch…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Man, that tears it, I’m calling the fuckin’
chief.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Couldn’t have been just…just the sun…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Believe it, shithead.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Until it goes down.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh no! Shit! Pettine! Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Who did it, did you see anyone?</p>
<p><strong>labowitz</strong>: Chief, come quick…</p>
<p><strong>labowitz</strong>: Pettine’s on the radio, they’re under
attack.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Hot damn, we got contact!</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Pettine, what’s your situation.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: I’m afraid …</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I have to go, Babette, I have to get help.
I’ll be back, I promise. You hide somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Listen up! We got officers under attack, I
need volunteers for a posse! Y’all sign up with Officer Labowitz
here!</p>
<p><strong>affectionately</strong>: at the button head mask inside. He
snaps the case shut as Eigerman re-enters, followed by the silent Kane.
Eigerman digs a key out of his desk.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: If you’re gonna make an omelette you have
to break eggs, isn’t that right, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Christmas comes early this year.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Ounce a’ prevention is worth a pound a’
cure. Save for a rainy day, one day that day will come. Don’t matter if
it’s Commies, homos, freaks or Japs, we are ready. World class ordnance,
Doc: the best private sector money can buy.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Marvelous, really, but -</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Now over here we’re talkin’ Damascus,
high-carbon Spetnatz shootin’ knives, and for that tough up-close-and-
personal work, you can always count on your razor-wire/fishing-line
garotte when nuthin’ else will do �</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Show him, Kane.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Now I know what you’re thinkin’, Doc;
maybe there’s some sort’a spiritual angle to all this. Well, we got that
covered, too.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Reverend Ashberry, your services are
required.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: He looks like a drunk.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: He is; lost his way, poor bastard, You
wouldn’t wanna miss the Day of Judgment, now would you?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: They’re warming up for it over in Midian.
Padre, you get your pious butt over to church and load up on some Holy
Water and crucifixes…we’re goin’ in there with God on our side.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: You are all hereby deputized in the name
of the law. Now let’s kick some ass!</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Hey, chickie, want a ride?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: We have to get Boone out, Midian needs
him…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: What could he do?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He went into Baphomet’s chamber. He spoke
with the Baptiser…</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: And survived; nobody ever did that
before.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Perhaps Baphomet told him something,
something that could save Midian.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Where they keeping him?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Inside somewhere. He’ll be guarded.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He has powers of his own.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Tell me about it; what’s happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: He was bitten by a Nightbreed, see, the
taint’s in his system…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Boone has been turned, he’s one of us…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Okay. So what you’re saying is, you’re saying
he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Hey, some of my best friends are dead.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Ever performed an exorcism, Father?</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Ever seen one?</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Well I’d start rehearsin’ if I was you.
Why don’t you hang on to that, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Oh…you will.</p>
<p><strong>cormack</strong>: Little Irish in your joe, Constable
Labowitz?</p>
<p><strong>cormack</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Help me, please.</p>
<p><strong>cormack</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Accident. We need help.</p>
<p><strong>cormack</strong>: What’s the problem, lady?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Where is he? Where’s Boone?</p>
<p><strong>cormack</strong>: Cell f-f-f-five…through the door…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Come closer…I don’t want to kill you…</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Naughty, naughty.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You know what I did in that room? I’m a
goddamn cannibal. Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: They’re going to come for you.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Let them. Let them find some way to kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You can’t die. Midian needs you.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Midian’s just a hole in the ground. It’s full
of things that should lie down and stay dead.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: All right. If not for the Breed, then for me.
You can’t give up on us.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You talk like you’re one of them.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Maybe I wish I was. Some little part of me.
All I know is, I’m not afraid of you. I know I should be, but I’m not. I
still want you, whatever you are. And I’m not going to leave you. If
they come for you, then they’ll have to kill me too.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: So fight. For both of us. For all of us. I
don’t want to be dust. I want us flesh and blood. Kiss me. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: What the hell are you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Yes…yes!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are we going?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: About time.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Midian.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: It’s about time they saw the truth.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: How long until dark?</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Two hours. Two and a half. I told ’em to
bring gasoline. We’ll burn the bastards out.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Has it occurred to you maybe we’ve got this
all wrong? We could be destroying…I don’t know, a whole new species.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: You saw that fucker below, Lieutenant, same
as me. That damn thing was just too weird to live.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Maybe they’re just different.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Isn’t that enough reason?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Yee-hah!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: It’s the fuckin’ cavalry!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: How much further?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: A mile, maybe two…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We’re too late.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: …packets of plastique at every intersection,
trip wires outside the biggest tombs, we figure those’ll be the major
escape routes…</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Jesus, not there, STOP. We got Claymores
planted in the rosebushes, Reverend, cut your nuts off faster’n a hedge
clipper.</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: We’ve made a mistake, there are Angels
here, a heavenly host…</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: You’re drunk, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: No. Listen to me, it’s wrong, it’s
sacrilege, this is holy ground…</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Get the hell up that hill, you
pinhead.</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: You brought me here because I’m a man of
God.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: That’s right; hang round here a couple
more minutes, Padre, and you’ll be sitting at his left hand. Now get
your sorry ass out of the fuckin’ way…</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Stay down! Stay where you are, they’re
waiting for us above…</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: This is our home.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Not anymore…</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: We belong here…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Listen to me, old man, the rules change; if
you want to live it won’t be here and it won’t be by your laws…</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Yes. It could be done.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: It must be done. Brothers and sisters, it’s
time to fight!</p>
<p><strong>leroy</strong>: You hear what he said?</p>
<p><strong>lude</strong>: What chance have we got? They’re armed.</p>
<p><strong>leroy</strong>: They call us monsters, remember? They’re
afraid of us. Let’s give ’em reason.</p>
<p><strong>lude</strong>: It’s a long time since I spilled blood.</p>
<p><strong>leroy</strong>: You never lose the knack.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: …I’m waiting…Philip?…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Let me out, Philip. There’s going to be
bloodshed. I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Ah, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: We can’t let anyone see us…</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: I want to be free!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Decker?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Lieutenant… You gave me such a start.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Eigerman’s invited you to watch from the
command post.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Oh, I don’t think I’m up to it, really.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: …I’ve got a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Believe me, Lieutenant, whoever or
whatever’s living down there deserves what’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Monsters, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Unnatural, misbegotten creatures.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I don’t know. The only monsters I’ve ever
seen had a human face.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: I want my mother.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: We began this.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: I just wanted meat. I didn’t know he was
going to cause this.</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: There were prophesies. The seventh
saviour.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: I didn’t believe the prophesies and I
didn’t obey the Law. You want to see me bleed for it? All right, I’ll
bleed.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: That sound like a heavenly choir to you,
Padre?</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: I have to see!</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Pettine!</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Chief?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: We’re moving in.</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: Dear Lord …Forgive me…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Don’t deny me Philip…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Soon. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Babette!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Rachel, no!</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Now, perfect, finish her. She’s the only
one who knows about us.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: What about Boone?</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Boone’s a monster. They all die
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>the mask</strong>: Quickly, Philip, we’ll lose her.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Is this wise? Coming above ground?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: If we stay below they’ll slaughter us.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: This is their territory.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No. The night’s ours. Now get the rest of the
children up here, I’m going to find a clear way through!</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: They’re coming out, and they’re armed, so
watch yourselves. It’s a fucking freak-show in there! We’re not taking
prisoners! It’s us or them! Let’s clean up!</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Us or them! Us or them!</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Eat dirt, fucker!</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Oh shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Oh my Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What the hell are you doing down here? We
need help!</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: This was intended.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Fuck that! We’re not going to lie down and
die.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: It’s Baphomet’s will. He’s going to
destroy the Naturals, and us. Everything, in one last fire.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: It’s going to blow?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: He’ll destroy his own people?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: Better it ends quickly. We can’t escape
them. We remind them of the darkness in themselves. They hate that.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: So did I. I learned better. We can make it
out. But I need fighters.</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: We’re not warriors…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: What about the Berserkers?</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: They’re uncontrollable.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: All the better. Let them out. Don’t just
stand there!</p>
<p><strong>lylesburg</strong>: I’ll release the Berserkers.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Be quick. We haven’t got forever. Yet.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: You come with me. The rest of you get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Oh Jesus, Boone.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Arm yourselves! Defend yourselves! You’re not
cattle, for Christ’s sake. They don’t have any right to kill you!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Weapons! You need weapons or it’s over!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: All of you!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Stop them getting in! They’ll kill the
children!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: They’re everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>leopardo</strong>: We can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: He told us to.</p>
<p><strong>leopardo</strong>: He can’t help us. He’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Look what we got here! A freak-show nursery
school.</p>
<p><strong>pettine</strong>: Say goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: What way’s safe?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: The west wall! But be quick! I’m going after
Eigerman.</p>
<p><strong>lude</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>leroy</strong>: The usual. You take the big guy. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>leroy</strong>: I wouldn’t do that if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>1st posse</strong>: Give me a good reason why not.</p>
<p><strong>leroy</strong>: I’ll give you two!</p>
<p><strong>1st posse</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>lude</strong>: Pretty gun.</p>
<p><strong>leroy</strong>: Look at this mess.</p>
<p><strong>lude</strong>: Just like the old days.</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: Look at these bastards. Fucking freaks.</p>
<p><strong>1st cop</strong>: Yow!</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>1st cop</strong>: Where the fuck did that come from?</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: It’s just a girl…</p>
<p><strong>1st cop</strong>: I don’t…feel…so…good…</p>
<p><strong>kane</strong>: It’s OK, Baby.</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: Oh shit! Kane!</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: Kane?</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: Keep away from me!</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: . Please, you’ve got to stop…</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Go ahead, faggot, You haven’t got the
balls to pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Sorry, Padre. Nobody’s listening…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: Don’t kill me!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Run, go on! We don’t like priests here.</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: No, no, take me, I have to see.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone! Boone!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Watch the pretty light.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Watch this!</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Stand your ground! Stand your ground!
They’ve got to come this way. We can mow ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Gibbs?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Lights!</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Boone… Lori. She’s hurt.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Falling!</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: It’s all over. I didn’t believe the
prophesies and now it’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: What prophesies?</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: You want to see?</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Yes, it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: All these years waiting for a saviour. But
he hasn’t saved us. He’s destroyed us. I made him, and he’s destroyed
us.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Made him?</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: The bite was mine. The bite that mocks
death.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: That doesn’t make him yours. I belong here on
this wall, just as much as you do. Why aren’t I here?</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: You’re still a Natural. Go back while
you’ve still got a life. Join your tribe.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: That? My tribe? Not any longer.</p>
<p><strong>peloquin</strong>: Then die with us. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: Let me down. I can’t go any further.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Quite a dance, huh? Death everywhere and you
and me in the middle. Catch!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Even the dead can die!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Almost!</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Want to dance?</p>
<p><strong>baphomet</strong>: Boone!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Decker’s dead. Take the knife out.</p>
<p><strong>baphomet</strong>: Boone!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Don’t go…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I’m. responsible. I have to.</p>
<p><strong>rachel/baphomet</strong>: Come closer…</p>
<p><strong>rachel/baphomet</strong>: …You have destroyed our refuge…</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I never meant…</p>
<p><strong>rachel/baphomet</strong>: This was foretold. No refuge is
forever. But you are charged . . .</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>rachel/baphomet</strong>: …You must rebuild what you’ve
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>rachel/baphomet</strong>: That you must find yourself. In the
world above.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: I don’t…I don’t know how…</p>
<p><strong>rachel/baphomet</strong>: You shall not be alone. You will
find me there and heal me. You are not Boone…</p>
<p><strong>baphomet</strong>: …you are Cabal!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Give me my child…</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Never piss off a God.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Where are they going?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Any hiding place they can find. It’ll be
dawn soon.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: When I need you where will I find you?</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: You’ll find me. And you will need me.</p>
<p><strong>narcisse</strong>: Never touched a legend before.</p>
<p><strong>cabal</strong>: I’ll have to start tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I’ll go with you, Boone.</p>
<p><strong>cabal</strong>: I’m not Boone, Lori. Do you understand? I
belong to the Breed now.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Then make me belong too; they made you one of
them, you can do it to me…</p>
<p><strong>cabal</strong>: I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I want to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>cabal</strong>: I’ll come back for you when I’m finished…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: And when’s that gonna be, when I’m ninety and
you’re still the way you are? I went through hell to find you and you
just, just walk away from me? Well go on, then, just go. Go on! What
more do you want? Leave me some dignity, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Boone!</p>
<p><strong>cabal</strong>: Lori, NO!</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I lied, I lied, you’re all I want.</p>
<p><strong>cabal</strong>: Don’t die, God, Lori, don’t die…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Well why don’t you do something about it, God
damn it… remember what you said……quickly…</p>
<p><strong>cabal</strong>: …too late?…Oh God, too late…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You said you’d never leave me.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: Keep your distance!</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: I saw their God…I saw him…</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: I can still smell him. He’s out there…</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: You mean you can find them?</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: We’ll go together then. You can lead me to
the bastards. Then I’ll wipe them all away.</p>
<p><strong>ashberry</strong>: No. They’re mine. Their God burned me. I
want to burn him back. All of them. Burn them all away.</p>
<p><strong>eigerman</strong>: You can’t, you don’t have the wits …</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: …who will come for us?</p>
<p><strong>kinski</strong>: His name is Cabal. He unmade Midian.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: How soon?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: On the next wind. If not tonight, then
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: On the next wind…</p>
<p><strong>babette</strong>: …if not tonight…tomorrow…</p>
