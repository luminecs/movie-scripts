<p><strong>south carolina</strong>: April, 1776</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Damnation!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Father, I saw a post rider at the house.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you. Did you finish the upper
field?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: We got it all cut and we bundled half of
it.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Those swimming breaks cut into the day,
don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, a post rider came from Charleston.
You have a letter inside.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you. How’s the spotted one’s milk?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Better. She’s near ready to calve.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: … and they bundled half… almost no trace of
the boys you knew…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: … no, she still hasn’t spoken… Margaret was
her age when you… I remember the time at the river when we couldn’t find
Catherine… you couldn’t stop crying… and she was asleep in the wagon the
entire time…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Your children.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I smell turnips…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Father, Samuel broke the blue plate…</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I did not…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Dinner…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: News of Boston, father?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I hate turnips…</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: William knocked it right out of my
hands…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father…?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Samuel, William, both of you clean it
up…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The Assembly has been reconvened, I’ve been
called to…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Charleston!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: We’re going to Charleston!</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: When, father, when?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We’ll leave tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>the children</strong>: Charleston! We’re going to
Charleston!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I love turnips…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: … now count five finger lengths up from
the front two stars of the Big Dipper, and that’s the North Star, that’s
her.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It helps her to know Mother’s there.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: The New York and Rhode Island assemblies
have been dissolved…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The middle colonies?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Rioting both sides of the bay, in
Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the
Customs Agent. He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal
Magistrate and two Redcoats.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Anything about the convention in
Philadelphia?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Poor Richard says they’ll make a
Declaration of Independence by July.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Scott Higgins joined the militia.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: He’s seventeen. A year younger than</p>
<p><strong>the children</strong>: Aunt Charlotte! Aunt Charlotte!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Welcome! Welcome! Margaret, William, look
at you…! They’re huge. What have you been feeding them?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: They’re from good stock on their mother’s
side.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Come, come, inside, wait until you see
what I have…</p>
<p><strong>the children</strong>: Presents! For me? What do you
have?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Inside, inside…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You look well, Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: As do you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Inside, all of you…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Look! There’s Gabriel!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Children, inside! All of you! Right
now.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What news?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: The British army is barricaded in Boston.
Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Is that why the Assembly was convened?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and
money.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And the Governor?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: He vowed that if the Assembly votes a
single shilling to Lee, he’ll dissolve the body.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Which would force our delegates in
Philadelphia to vote for independence.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: And send us to war alongside
Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Our governor is a bigger fool than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Lee is counting on your vote and expects
you to be the first to enlist.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Our first order of business…</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: And out last if we vote a levy…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: ORDER! ORDER! Mr. Simms, you do not have
the floor.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Our first order of business is an address
by Colonel Harry Lee of the Continental Army.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You all know why I am here. I am not an orator
and I will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause. I am
a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we
all expect from Philadelphia, it will soon be a formal state of war. In
preparation for that, eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money
in support of a Continental Army. I ask South Carolina to be the
ninth.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at war,
along with New Hampshire and Rhode Island and Virginia, but South
Carolina is not at war.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Massachusetts and New Hampshire are not as far
from South Carolina as you might think and the war they’re fighting is
not for independence of one or two colonies. It’s for the independence
of a nation.</p>
<p><strong>withington</strong>: And what nation is that?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your
permission?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Those of us who call ourselves Patriots
are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one
that already exists. It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at
Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every
generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. We are a
nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a
tyrant three thousand miles away.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Thank you. Were I an orator, those are the
exact words I would have spoken.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Mister Robinson, tell me, why should I trade
one tyrant, three thousand miles away, for three thousand tyrants, one
mile away?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: An elected legislature can trample a man’s
rights just as easily as a King can.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Captain Marion, I understood you to be a
Patriot.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s Mister Marion.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I understood him to be a Patriot as well.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: If you mean by a Patriot, am I angry at the
Townsend Acts and the Stamp Act? Then I’m a Patriot. And what of the
Navigation Act? Should I be permitted to sell my tobacco to the French
traders on Martinique? Yes, and it’s an intrusion into my affairs that I
can’t… legally.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And what of the greedy, self-serving
bastards who sit as Magistrates on the Admiralty Court and have fined
nearly every man in this room. Should they be boxed about the ears and
thrown onto the first ship back to England? I’ll do it myself. And do I
believe that the American colonies should stand as a separate,
independent nation, free from the reins of King and Parliament? I do,
and if that makes a Patriot, then I’m a Patriot.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: But if you’re asking whether I’m willing to
go to war with England, the answer is, no. I’ve been to war and I have
no desire to do so again.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: This from the same Captain Francis Marion
whose anger was so famous during the Wilderness Campaign.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I was intemperate in my youth. My departed
wife, God bless her soul, dampened that intemperance with the mantle of
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Temperance can be a convenient disguise
for fear.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion
in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign. We
served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain
Marion’s courage or competence on a battlefield. There’s not a man in
this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly
trust my life.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: I stand corrected.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister
Marion, how… how… how…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Damn it, Francis! How in God’s name do you
expect to gain independence without going to war?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Harry, Harry, Harry…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: My hairy arse! You live in a cave if you think
we’ll get independence without war…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Gentlemen! Please! This is not a
tavern!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Wasn’t it a Union Jack we fought under?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: A long time ago…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thirteen years…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: That’s a damn long time…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Gentlemen! Please!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You were an Englishman then…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I was an American, I just didn’t know it
yet…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We don’t have to go to war to gain
independence…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Balderdash!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There are a thousand avenues, other than
war, at our disposal…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Name five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial
redress, economic boycott, bribery…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: That’s five, keep going…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: … time, royal succession, regicide,
bribery…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You said bribery twice…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We do not have to go to war to gain
independence.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Francis, I was at Bunker Hill. It was as bad as
anything you and I saw on the frontier. Worse than the slaughter at the
Ashuelot River. The British advanced three times and we killed over
seven hundred of them at point blank range. And still, they advanced and
they took the ground. That is the measure of their resolve. If your
principles dictate independence, then war is the only way. It has come
to that.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I have seven children. My wife is dead.
Who’s to care for them if I go to war?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Wars are not fought only by childless men. A
man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’s what I’m doing. I will not fight and
because I won’t, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight
in my stead.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: And your principles?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m a parent, I don’t have the luxury of
principles.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on a
levy to the Continental Army.</p>
<p><strong>hamill</strong>: Second.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: So moved.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Yea.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. Hamill.</p>
<p><strong>hamill</strong>: Yea.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Yea.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. Simms.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Nay.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. Marion.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. Marion.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Nay.</p>
<p><strong>page boy</strong>: Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy
passed!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, I’ve lost respect for you. I
thought you were a man of principle.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: When you have children, I hope you’ll
understand.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: When I have children, I hope I don’t hide
behind them.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Do you intend to enlist without my
permission?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: One of yours?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I recognize him now. Is he as imprudent as his
father was at his age?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No, thank the Lord. He’s more like his
mother.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’ll see to it that he serves under me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Not yet, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: But it’s already been two years and that’s
two more years. The war could be over by then.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: God willing.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Alright. Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Is it going to rain?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: That’s not thunder.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Six-pounders. Lots of them.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: How far away?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Four, five miles.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Waxhaus?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Just east of it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Are we safe here?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte’s farm.
She’s to the west.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No, there’ll be skirmishers on the roads.
We’re safer here.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Put those away.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: But father, they might come this way.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Put them away.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Enough. I’ll be in the workshop. Samuel, the
cows. Thomas, attend to your studies here on the porch. Nathan, on the
back porch. If you see anyone, come get me. Margaret, please keep
William close to you. No one is to go past the yard wall.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Children.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Samuel…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Samuel, get up to the house. You heard
father…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Up to the house, now. All of you, come on.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: They’re going to come.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: We’re going to have to fight them off.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Father will do that.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: They’ll probably kill us men and do Lord
knows what to you women.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Samuel!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Gabriel!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’re hurt.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: The battle, were you there?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Margaret, get bandages and water. Thomas,
the porch, eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Have you seen any Redcoats?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Not yet. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It wasn’t like Saratoga. There, we stayed
in the trees, but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats.
They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw. I was given
these dispatches… I saw Virginia Regulars surrender… as they laid down
their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them
to bits… killed them all, over two hundred men.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: They had surrendered?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I have to get these dispatches to
Hillsboro.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You’re in no condition to ride.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I have no choice, I…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Margaret, take William and Susan down to the
root cellar. Thomas, go to the back porch. Nathan and Samuel, the side
windows. Keep out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: He’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thomas, help me turn him over…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thomas!</p>
<p><strong>continental sergeant</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Sergeant, there are seventeen wounded men
here. Seven Redcoats and ten Patriots, counting my son inside. That puts
me in a difficult position.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You three are the least severely wounded. I
have to ask you to leave and find care elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Come on, boys.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: But they’re wounded.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There are rules, even in war.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: After the Battle of Ashuelot River, against
the French, I got this and the one on my leg. I couldn’t walk.
Washington had to march north. He left me with other wounded men and a
like number of French prisoners. Nine for nine. When the French found
us, their surgeon gave me the best of care. We’ll be safe this way.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Your best chance is in Bennington, seven
miles east, along the river road.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: You’re surrendering.</p>
<p><strong>continental sergeant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: What unit?</p>
<p><strong>continental sergeant</strong>: First Virginia Regulars under
Colonel Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Who cared for your wounds?</p>
<p><strong>continental sergeant</strong>: We did.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: With a lace table cloth?</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Kill them.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: These men are of my regiment.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat</strong>: Rebel dispatches, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I carried those. I was wounded, these
people gave me care, they have nothing to do with the dispatches.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Lieutenant, have a detachment take our
wounded to our surgeons at Camden crossing. Use whatever horses and
wagons you can find here.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: We found this, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Who carried this?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Take this one to Camden, he’s a spy. He
will be hung.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Colonel, he’s a dispatch rider and that’s a
marked dispatch case.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Fire the house and barns.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Colonel…</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: And the Rebel wounded?</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Kill them.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: A dispatch rider with a marked case cannot
be held for spying.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: We’re not going to hold him, we’re going
to hang him.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father…</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Oh, he’s your son. You should have taught
him about loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider. By
the rules of war, a dispatch rider with a marked case…</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Would you like a lesson in the rules of
war?</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Perhaps your children would.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No lesson is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Father, do something.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Gabriel! Run!</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Major.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Thomas, please, Thomas…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Lieutenant, please…</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: I have my orders. Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Papa, look what they did to Thomas…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Father, they’re going to take Gabriel…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Father, you can’t let them take him…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Nathan, Samuel…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Margaret, take William and Susan to the
river shed. Hide there. If we’re not back by dawn, go up the river to
the Richardson’s house. They’ll take you to your Aunt Charlotte’s farm.
Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: But what about Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Leave him. Take care of William and
Susan.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Nathan, there. Samuel, there.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll fire first. Then, Nathan, kill whoever
is standing closest to Gabriel. Samuel, kill the last man in the
line.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: After that, Samuel, load for Nathan. If
something happens to me, put down your weapons and run as fast as you
can, that way, downhill. Hide in the brush by the river, then make your
way home, get the others and go to Aunt Charlotte’s farm.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Boys… steady.</p>
<p><strong>nathan &amp; samuel</strong>: Yes, father.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Samuel, reload. Nathan, untie Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There, there… he’s alright… he’s with your
mother now…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Lord, we pray that You accept this child,
Thomas Marion and give him a place at Your side with his mother. We ask
that You embrace him and help us to understand the manner in which Your
mercy works. This we ask, in Your name. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>marion’s children</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams,
Stantons…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, it’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Sleep, now.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Father… I killed those men…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t blame yourself, you did what I told
you to do.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m glad I killed them… I’m glad…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Try to get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’ll stay with them.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: How are they?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Gates is at Hillsboro with the Continental
Army. I’ll leave in the morning to join him.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’ll tend my horse.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: They’re asleep.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How did this… how did I let this happen?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You couldn’t have known.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I should have known… once I would have… I
used to be wary… and today I watched my son killed before my eyes… your
sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Thomas is dead but you’ve done nothing
for which you should be ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ve done nothing and for that I am
ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: If you go, I’ll care for them as if they
were my own.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll leave in the morning with Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: When will you be back?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I don’t know, William.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No, not tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Just one word? Goodbye? That’s all I
want.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No, it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Command posts… Patriot… British…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Break for the trees… break for the
trees…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Send them to cover! Goddamn you!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, we have to do something…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s already over.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Damn you, Sergeant, don’t move the wounded
twice, put them straight on the wagons from the surgeons.</p>
<p><strong>patriot sergeant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Lieutenant, detail men for outriders. We move
out as soon as the wounded are ready.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my
son, Thomas. It was Tarleton himself.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m sorry I wasn’t here for this.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: There’s nothing you could have done, Gates is a
damned fool.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We saw.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees
but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.
He spent too many years in the British army.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his
staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Who’s in command?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I am, I think.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What are my orders?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: If you want orders, I’ve got some for you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: We’re a breath away from losing this war. In
the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding
from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats. Here in the South, Cornwallis
has broken our back. He captured over five thousand of our troops when
he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood
between him and New York.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: So now Cornwallis will head north, link up
with Clinton and finish off Washington.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: And Patriots will start dying on the gallows
instead of the battlefield. Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South
until the French arrive. A treaty was signed at Versailles after our
victory at Saratoga. The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand
troops.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Fall, six months at the earliest.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Long time.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: The bigger problem is where, not when. The
French fleet won’t sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early
storms.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: So you’re going to try to keep Cornwallis in
the South until then.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Not me, you. I’m going north with every
Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won’t last
six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You expect Cornwallis to be held here by
militia?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Not held, just slowed down.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: They’re nothing but farmers and you’re
asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard. They’d be better
off letting it move on.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: They’d be better off, but the cause wouldn’t
be.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How many men does Cornwallis have under his
command?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Four thousand infantry and around six hundred
cavalry… … including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m giving you a field commission as a
colonel.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Colonel Lee, I request a transfer to
Colonel Marion’s command.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Granted.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: What now, sir?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We put out the word. We’ll start along the
south side of the Santee…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: We’d cover more ground if we split up.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s safer if we stay together.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Colonel, I didn’t request this transfer
because you’re my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause
and this is where I can do the most good.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’ve been doing this for two years. I’m the
best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot,
the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between
here and Charleston.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes, sir. My father taught me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Did your father teach you humility?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: He tried. It didn’t take.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington,
Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp. I’ll take the
north side of the river. We’ll meet at Snow’s Island.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And, Corporal… … be careful.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes… … father.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m looking for John Billings.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: If he comes back from the dead, tell him
Francis Marion is looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I’ll be sure to do that.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll wait. Miracles happen.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: You expect to hold Cornwallis with
militia?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I expect to try.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Trust you and Harry Lee. Remember that
damned overland you two thought up in ’62 to hit Fort Louis?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It worked. How many men can you raise?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Not many. Dalton, Scott, they’ve got their
reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks;
a few like me with nothing to lose… What about you? You’ve got a lot to
lose.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You coming, or not?</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Several of Thomas’ brightly painted LEAD
SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan. The little men fall to their knees
then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten metal.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, this war is about more than
Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: If you’re here only for revenge, you’re
doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You know how old I am.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: God help us all when you’re forty.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Reverend.</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: I heard about your son. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Dalton.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You all have your own reasons for being
here. I lost a son and I intend to kill the man who killed him…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: … But I don’t consider that man’s life
adequate payment for the life of my son, and killing him won’t keep the
sons of other men from dying…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Cornwallis has to move north. We have to
keep him right here. If he’s south of the Chesapeake when the French
arrive, if the French arrive, we have a chance of winning this war.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Eat, get some rest, we move out in two
hours.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Major, this is not an adequate map.</p>
<p><strong>major huntington</strong>: We have better coming on the
trailing supply convoy from Charleston.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: A useful place for our maps.</p>
<p><strong>major huntington</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, it won’t happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: My harrier. Join us, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Gentlemen, celebration is premature. We
have a difficult campaign ahead of us. We are in predominately hostile
country and we cannot rely on forage. As we move north, the bulk of our
supplies will reach us by sea, through Charleston, which will give us a
long and vulnerable supply line, one that can only be secured if the
locals are loyal to the crown.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis’ officers</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Nonetheless, we must remember that this
is a civil war…</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: These colonials are our brethren and
when this conflict is over, we will be reestablishing commerce with
them. Surrendering troops will be given quarter and unwarranted assaults
on civilians will cease.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: I expect this war to be fought in a
vigorous but civilized manner.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Have I made myself clear, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>officers</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: I believe he was speaking to us,
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Did you know that Lord Cornwallis’ father
was a tenant on the estate of my grandfather?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Less than a mile. Forty-one wagons, a
company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Flanking riders?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I didn’t see any.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat lieutenant</strong>: Across the river! Covering fire!
Double rank!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Epaulets first… Kill the officers.</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: … two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess
muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping…</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: We have enough arms for an army. Now all
we need is an army.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Reamer, boring tool…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Swage, broach, etching tool…</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: A rolling gunsmith’s shop…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: We can rifle those musket barrels…</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: Get another hundred yards out of ’em…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We’ll need a forge…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Easy enough…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We’ve got clay to make a chamber…</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: Oak to make charcoal…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a
bellows…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And we can yank a wagon wheel, weight it,
rig a piston and drive shaft and we’ll have a flywheel to power the
bellows…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: That’s why he’s a colonel.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Shoot them! Shoot the damn things!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Put that pistol down!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: They followed us from the bridge. They won’t
let anyone near the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Stay… stay… stay…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t you growl at me!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Now let’s see what’s in this wagon.</p>
<p><strong>abner</strong>: Rum, French Champagne, Madeira, Port…</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: No wonder they were guarding it.</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: My heavens, personal correspondence of…
Lord Cornwallis.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: These four wagons must be his.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: And the dogs, too, I’ll wager.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs,
and use the papers for musket wadding.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: His journals, letters, maps, books…</p>
<p><strong>abner</strong>: Colonel, we got a wagon full of officer’s
uniforms and more powder and muskets here.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Today was hard earned but a good start.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: In the future wounded British soldiers will
be given quarters.</p>
<p><strong>dalton</strong>: Like they gave quarter to my family? My wife
and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came. The
Redcoats locked the door and torched the house.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You have my sympathy… but the order
stands.</p>
<p><strong>dalton</strong>: And who are you to give an order like that?
We all know what you did after Fort Wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m your commanding officer. This is
militia, not regular army. I can’t hold you here, but as long as you
stay, you’ll follow my orders.</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: For trying to impose some decency on
that sort.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t depend on my decency. I’m one of that
sort.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Am I one of that sort?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You’re the worst of that sort. You’re the
sort that gives that sort a bad name.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m going to check the watch.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: He shouldn’t make light. That Redcoat
should not have been killed.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: He’s not making light.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: You don’t know him very well, do you?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: He’s my father.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I know him well enough?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Don’t fault him for having grown up on the
frontier. It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ve just been inside the mind of a genius.
Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen
lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Cheerful news to greet the morn.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: His victories at Charleston and Camden were
perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically. But he has a
weakness.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Lord Cornwallis is brilliant. His weakness
is that he knows it.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Pride is his weakness.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Personally, I’d prefer stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Pride will do.</p>
<p><strong>begin montage</strong>: Series of shots as follows:</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Why am I here, Colonel Halbert?</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: For the ball, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Why, after six weeks, are we still here
to attend a ball. By now, we should be attending balls in North
Carolina, not South Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: Our supply line, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Excellent guess, Major.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: And what, praytell, is this?</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: Uh… I borrowed it from Colonel North. I took
it in at the back, added wider epaulets, a court sash and looped gold
braiding on the cuffs…</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: It’s a horse blanket. First my personal
baggage, then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston
burned, a dozen convoys attacked. Colonel, if you can’t secure our
supply line against militia, how do you expect to do so against Colonial
regulars or the French when they come?</p>
<p><strong>colonel halbert</strong>: Sir, they’re not like regulars, we
can’t find them and we don’t know when or where they’re going to
strike.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: How impolite. And who leads these
clever, secretive fellows?</p>
<p><strong>colonel halbert</strong>: We don’t know, sir. He’s called,
the Commander by some, the Swamp Fox by others.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Colonel, I’m a civilized man but I’m
finding to difficult to remain civil. Secure my supply line.</p>
<p><strong>colonel halbert</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat guard</strong>: Hey, what you got there?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: We got our own little party…</p>
<p><strong>dalton</strong>: To hell with the officers and their fancy
dress ball…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Give us a nip, here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. talbot</strong>: No! The beasts took your dogs, as
well?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Fine animals, a gift from His Majesty.
Dead now, for all I know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. talbot</strong>: Is there no decency?</p>
<p><strong>mr. talbot</strong>: Among the rebels? We know the answer to
that.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Yes, we have learned.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. talbot</strong>: You seem far away.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: It’s the weight of command and the lot
of a widower – memories, loneliness… … and long gazes at the moon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. talbot</strong>: Oh, you poor man…</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>mr. talbot</strong>: These rebels seem to lack fear as well
as decency, eh, General?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these
damned rebels.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: … four baskets of apples, salt pork, sweet
potatoes, jerky, hard tack, salt and powder. It’s not much, but I’ll get
you more.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We can’t pay for this…</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: I’ll give you what I can, when I can. You pay
me what you can.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Francis, you remember my daughter, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Nice to see you again, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last
time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I… uh… that wasn’t me, it was Samuel… I
mean Nathan…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It was you and it turned my teeth black for a
month.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Uh… uh… I…</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: He’s sorry. Come.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: … and your terms of enlistment will be
month-to-month. Every thirty days you can re-enlist or return to your
families.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Talk to Abner and Scott about provisions,
powder and mounts.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Twenty men here, seventeen in New
Brighton, a dozen along the Black River. We’ll pass three hundred by
week’s end if this keeps up.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: If I’d known you were going to look like
this, I never would have put ink in your tea.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You call that a compliment?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It’s a start.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: They look nice. As white as can be.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: He reminds me of you before you got old
and ugly.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No, he takes after his mother…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: … the younger ones barely remember her but
Gabriel spent more time with Elizabeth… she taught him well, guided him,
she was his North Star and mine… her father was a minister, in Boston,
did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: … Gabriel’s already a better man than I
could ever hope to be…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What do you mean, old and ugly?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: You got me beat on both accounts.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The hell I do.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Gabriel? Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: We’re low on salt. I should go to Pembroke
and get some.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: You got salt last week.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Oh, right. Baking powder, we need baking
powder.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: We’ve got plenty of baking powder. You
went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat sergeant</strong>: Halt. Look alive, boys.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Sergeant, this road is closed. Those wagons
now belong to the Continental Army.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat sergeant</strong>: Ready arms! By twos!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Sergeant, there’s no reason for you and your
men to die. Just leave the wagons and go.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat sergeant</strong>: Steady, boys…</p>
<p><strong>redcoat sergeant</strong>: This is the King’s highway and I
advise you and your men to make way. Prepare to fire.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s a trap…</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>gaskins</strong>: This way… no this… I think…</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Enough of this. There are other ways to
run down a fox.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, no…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’s him. Tarleton.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Damn you! Let go!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, please…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen
captured.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I should have killed him when I had the
chance?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: When was that? In the swamp at the expense
of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our
cause.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: There will be a time and a place for
revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one
but yourself. Stay the course.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Stay the course… your mother used to say
that to me when I’d get drunk or lose my temper.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: She’d say it to me when I picked on Thomas
or Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You learned her lessons better than</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: She got me at a more impressionable
age.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Next time we’ll bring more blankets.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: That would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Maybe we’ll be lucky this winter and have just
rain, no snow.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: That would be nice, too.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Just because the French didn’t come this fall,
doesn’t mean they’re never going to come.</p>
<p><strong>rollins</strong>: They’re to be hung!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: But they’re prisoners-of-war!</p>
<p><strong>redcoat sentry</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: General, a message from the commander of
the rebel militia.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a
formal parley.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Are you going to meet with him?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Most certainly. Arrange it.</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: Lord Cornwallis will be with you
presently.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: You may, of course, keep your
weapons, but I must warn you that…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m familiar with appropriate behavior at a
military parley.</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: Yes, quite, but you should know
that…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That will be all, Major. I’ll wait for Lord
Cornwallis.</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: Yes… you will wait.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: One other thing.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The proper form of address to a superior
officer, even one of an opposing army, is “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Jupiter! Mars!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: My boys… my boys… you seem to have been
well fed. Thank you for that, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: My pleasure, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Please forgive me for keeping you
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Apology accepted.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Thank you, Colonel… I’m afraid I don’t
know your name.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Colonel will do.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Colonel… Colonel Banastre Tarleton.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Shall we proceed?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Let us. Unless you object, I would like
to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are
certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m familiar with how a formal negotiation
is handled.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I served in His Majesty’s army in the French
and Indian War.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the
initiating party, like to begin?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Unless you would like to claim aggrieved
status.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: You are familiar with how these things
are done. In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Very well, proceed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: First, you have in your possession
certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers,
furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would
like to have returned to me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I will do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Please accept my apology for not having done
so sooner.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Apology accepted. Now, on the matter of
the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is
absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That one is a bit more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Certainly you must know that in
civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded
inappropriate levels of hostile attention.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And what are inappropriate levels of hostile
attention?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that
would result from un-led armies having at each other. There must be
gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their
men.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Restrain them from the targeting of
civilians, including women and children?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: That is a separate issue.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I consider them linked.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: I beg to differ. One is a command
decision on your part. The other represents nothing more than the
occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out
their duty in difficult circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I
will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every
engagement. And my men are excellent marksmen.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Very well, let us move on to…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Prisoner exchange.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You have eighteen of my men. I want them
back.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: I do have eighteen criminals under
sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: If that’s your position, then eighteen of
your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: What officers?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: In the clearing, just down from the crest,
to the left of the dark pines…</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Their names, ranks and posts?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: They refused to give me their names. Their
ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat
colonel who called me a cheeky fellow. Their posts? We picked them up
here-and-there last night.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: You are not a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: If your conduct is the measure of a
gentleman, I take that as a compliment. Get my men.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Arrange the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you, General. I’m sure your officers
will thank you, as well.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You don’t remember me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Ah, yes, that boy.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Ugly business, doing one’s duty.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Yes, ugly business.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: If you are alive when this war is over, I’m
going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Jupiter! Mars!</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Take a detachment and go get our
officers.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: One of the “Redcoat Officers,” stuffed
with straw is thrown onto Cornwallis’ desk by Tarleton.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: This fox believes himself clever. We
shall see.</p>
<p><strong>gaskins</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: No one’s been here for months.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: But now we have a name for our Colonel…
Francis Marion. And with a name will come a family.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: They can’t be far. Check the outbuildings
and the woods.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It’s all set.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: This will do fine.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: So he’s the one they talk about, the
Swamp Fox.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I thought it might be him, the bits and
pieces we heard, a veteran, fought in the French and Indian War, knows
the swamps.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: They won’t stop looking for you and the
children.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: We’ll be alright, here, for now. How is
he?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I don’t know… I’m his son.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: These are for you and the children.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Why didn’t father come?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Speaking for months now.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Why didn’t he come?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn’t leave
his men.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He left us.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I know he did and he’s sorry. He’ll come
back as soon as he can.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: There are some letters here from him. Some
are just to you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t care. I hate him.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You don’t hate him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never
comes back.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: She spoke? Susan spoke?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Full sentences. As if she had been speaking
all along.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I don’t believe it… and I wasn’t there for
it…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Tell me everything she said, word for
word.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: She said… she loves you and misses you but
she understands why you can’t be there with her.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: She said that? Oh, my Lord, she said
that?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Isn’t that something.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, there’s something else I need to
talk to you about.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Come with me. I’ll tell you when we get
there.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, I’m looking for a best man.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’d be honored.</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in
the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Sir, I’d like to request a furlough. Two
days?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Granted. Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Cheraw Falls.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s beautiful there. Your mother and I were
there once, before you were born.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: She would have been pleased.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m sorry we didn’t give you more warning.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s alright. I’m very happy for you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s a good measure of a woman that she’ll
have her honeymoon under the stars.</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: For richer, for poorer, in sickness and
in health, ’til death do they part.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: From General Clinton in New York… “…
your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with
your militia problem.” He underlined, ‘militia’. “You have spent over
six months dealing with a six-week problem. It is essential that you
quell the militia…” Underlined again. “… insurgency, particularly
because of the likely move south of Washington and the inevitable
arrival of the French. Militia, as you have so often pointed out, is not
worth the attention of a significant army, hence it is mystifying why
militia has bedeviled you for so long…”</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: “… it is my fervent hope that the vigor
of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with
your Parliamentary and Court patrons. Only then might you share in the
victory, on the verge of which I now stand.” “Your guardedly respectful
Commander, General Sir George Clinton.”</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: If I fail, you fail.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: And if I triumph, you triumph.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: How can we end this madness?</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Difficult, sir. This is, as you pointed
out, a civil war.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Civility is a secondary virtue. It is
superseded by duty.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: I understand, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: I believe they are almost ready.</p>
<p><strong>gaskins</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. He died.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Very well, get one of the others.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Damn your eyes. Do your worst.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: I intend to.</p>
<p><strong>dalton</strong>: You still want me to give wounded Redcoats
quarter?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on
it. A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning
them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Seven homes along the Black River so
far…</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: It’s not time for vengeance, it’s time
to mourn and…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Five day furlough for all men. Abner, Dan,
Reverend, spread the word. We’ll reform at Acworth. Any man who doesn’t
come back won’t be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause. Attend
to your families.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s him! I told you it was him!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Papa…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Susan…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I told you, things would get better.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The overlook, up there should be where you
post the watch. Work out a schedule. Short watches, especially at night.
If you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put
them along there for alarms. Now let’s find someplace to cache extra
weapons…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Good apple.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Very good. Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: May I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Do you think Frances with an “e” is too manly
a name for a girl?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Do you think Francis with an “i” is too
womanly a name for a boy?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Late summer.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’m not my sister.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I said, I’m not my sister.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Of course, I do.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Very well, then.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Just a little goodbye? One word? That’s all
I want to hear.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Goodbye, Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Papa!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Papa, don’t go, I’ll say anything.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please, Papa, I’ll say anything you want!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Just tell me what to say! Tell me what to
say!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please, Papa, please don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: … I’ll talk to you, I’ll say anything you
want, just tell me what you want me to say, I’ll say anything, I
promise, please, Papa, just stay…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll come back… I promise…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How many came back?</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: About a hundred and twenty. Less than a
third.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat sergeant</strong>: Excuse me, Ma’am, everyone has
been requested to gather at the church.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Everyone?</p>
<p><strong>redcoat sergeant</strong>: Colonel Tarleton wants to address,
the whole village.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat</strong>: Into the church, please.</p>
<p><strong>another redcoat</strong>: Colonel Tarleton wishes to address
all of you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Open this door!</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: By what right are we made
prisoners?</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Yes, Major.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Sir, there is no honor in this.</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: The honor is found in the end, not the
means. This will be forgotten. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Anne…?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t go in there.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Is it her? Is Anne in there?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: She is. Don’t go in there.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Father, tell me what happened at Fort
Wilderness?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Everyone knows. It’s what made me a hero.
Me, Harry Lee, all of us. I got a medal. Men bought me drinks. They
still do sometimes. Everyone knows what happened.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Tell me what everyone doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And what do they know?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: That the French and Cherokees captured the
fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did
during the occupation.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: That’s not enough. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Your mother asked me the same question
around the time you were born. I was drunk and I was foolish enough to
answer her.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’s why it was four years between you and
Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’m not my mother. I can’t have the respect
without the knowing.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It was in ’63. It was a bad time. The French
and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge. All the English
settlers took refuge at Fort Wilderness but the French captured it. We
were sent in relief. Harry Lee, Billings, sixty of us. We already had
something of a reputation for being… harsh. When we got there the fort
was abandoned. Not a French soldier or Cherokee anywhere. They had left
a week earlier. What we found was… bad.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: They had left the settlers there. The men
had been burned alive, the women were in pieces and the children were on
stakes.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We buried them, then we went to track. It
was a cold trail and they were moving fast. We went faster. We caught up
to them at Kentucky Ford.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We took our time with them and gave every
one of them worse than they had given at the fort. It was two weeks
before they were all dead, all except two. We put the heads on a pallet
and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon. The
eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the
Asheulot to the Cherokee. The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after
that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out
of the fight. That seemed to make a difference. The war went another
year, things went better… and men bought us drinks.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It was a different time, son. And you’re a
better man than that.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I see, do as I say, not as I do.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: If this war is about more than Thomas, it’s
about more than Anne, as well. Stay the course.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: As you did at Fort Wilderness?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Look at you! I knew you could do it!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: We have a chance! Better than a chance!
Cornwallis is running to the Chesapeake, probably to meet his fleet at
Yorktown. I wish I could see his face when he sees a dozen French ships
floating there. And Washington should be a day or two behind him. And on
top of everything, I have a son! Born last month in Alexandria.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: His wife was killed yesterday. She was with
child.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dalton</strong>: Gabriel and at least a dozen others. They
must have left right after the watch change.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That means they have two hours on us.</p>
<p><strong>brother joseph</strong>: Fifty Green Dragoons, camped about a
quarter mile from here. Sentries at four points.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’m alright, I…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Let me help you…</p>
<p><strong>dalton</strong>: Colonel…</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: May I help you try to find solace with
the word of God?</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: Colonel, let us help his soul find it’s
place with the Almighty and…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: He looks as if he’s sleeping, doesn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>rev. oliver</strong>: Yes, he does.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You have to bury him.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’ll help you bury him.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: How many men have we seen die?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Two. Gabriel and Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: They’re gone. And there is nothing you or I can
do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all
this.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It is ended.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No. It’s not over yet. Two days ride, Yorktown,
Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton. It will end,
one way or another. Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping
us will justify their sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>runner</strong>: You called for me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Take this to General Washington.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Did you bring me this?</p>
<p><strong>runner</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Take this to Colonel Marion.</p>
<p><strong>runner</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Colonel Francis Marion.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Gray.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Earned.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Come. I have something I want to show
you.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I was sorry to hear about your son.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was
only fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’ve had no sons to lose, nor daughters.
I lose the sons of other men.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Life was easier when we only had
ourselves to get killed.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Gentlemen, what do we see?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Mortars, center, with two lines of
enfilading trenches.</p>
<p><strong>pinkney</strong>: More along the right flank and behind the
forward redoubts.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: A formidable defensive position. Very
formidable.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: They could hold out for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Francis, tell me about General
Cornwallis.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Remember Braddock?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: That bad?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Worse.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Proud, priggish and competent. A very
bad combination in an adversary.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: For those of you who don’t know, we
intercepted a British dispatch this morning. General Clinton has sailed
from New York to relieve Cornwallis.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: How long before they arrive?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Less than a week. Sixteen ships and over
nine thousand Redcoats.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Sooner or later that message will get
through to Cornwallis.</p>
<p><strong>pinkney</strong>: And when it does, he’ll just wait us
out.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: And when the British ships arrive, the
French ships will flee. And when the French ships flee, General
Rochambeau and the French troops will flee as well.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Then you must let the message go
through.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton
is coming, he’ll simply hold tight and wait. He’ll fight a purely
defensive battle and he’ll win that.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No, he won’t. There are two things you need
to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather
risk defeat than share a victory. If you give him what he thinks is an
out, he’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: And what is the second thing?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll let him tell you himself… “… but it is
this colonial militia that is the most irksome. Not worthy of my
attention, but demanding it; not worthy of British blood, but taking it;
and not worthy of a soldier’s honor, but sullying it. Those nights of
mine that are not sleepless, are filled with dreams of a cavalry charge
on the heels of fleeing farmers…”</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: He has no respect for citizen soldiers.
That’s your bait… militia.</p>
<p><strong>major halbert</strong>: Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton
made it through the rebel lines.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Call a general staff meeting.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The British army believes in officers. I
believe in soldiers. After we engage, there will be no more orders.
Every man here must know what I’m about to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: We are the bait in a trap. We’re militia.
Cornwallis thinks we’re rabble, nothing more than a bunch of
undisciplined farmers. And if he thinks that’s what we are, that’s what
we’re going to give him. Listen up.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Do you see that, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>tarleton</strong>: Unless I’m dreaming, I think I see
irregulars at their center.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Fix bayonets… dispatch the Green
Dragoons.</p>
<p><strong>marion, his men and the entire mass of fleeing
militia</strong>: STOPS DEAD, turns and joins the blue American
line…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Goodbye, Francis.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Goodbye, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And congratulations on the birth of your
son.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Thank you. Maybe all of this will buy him some
peace.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Your son, what did you name him?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Robert. Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: A good name for a farmer.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Two pounds, fourteen ounces.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Wait for me…</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Damnation!</p>
