<p><strong>when war and tumult torment the earth,</strong>: THE DEAD ARE
DISQUIETED: THERE IS FRENZY IN THE GRAVE. HERODOTUS</p>
<p><strong>first officer’s voice</strong>: Dead on the field, four
thousand five hundred seventy�two of the enemy � three thousand of our
own men. Burial parties are already at work. We are assigning men from
every company to clear the field,</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos’ voice</strong>: Tell them to pour lime in the
graves.</p>
<p><strong>first officer’s voice</strong>: Enemy casualties estimated as
nine thousand �� prisoners ��five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: A greet battle �� a great
victory!</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: To be sure . Enough blood spilled to
satisfy anyone – except General Nikolas Pherides. You’re letting that
fool drain your life away.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Your father always prescribed it, and I’m
alive to tell you so.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: At least get a decent night’s sleep.
Consider it a prescription from my father..</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Why not Take the doctor’s advice? You’re the
hero of the battle of Corphon.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Hero?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: In the New York Morning Globe, the man who
wins victory is always a hero. -</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Listen ��</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You know that sound, Oliver?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at
Nukden, Port Arthur. What do you expect after a battle?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You were at those battles as a spectator �
� I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me �� those
men out there �� dead or dying �� by my order – because I willed it
so.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Over there, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Do you mind if I go with you?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: There’s no one there -� nothing but the
caves and the dead.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’ll only go as far as the shore and wait
for you.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’ll leave this here to guide us back.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Cerberus �� the watchdog. He guards the
sleep of those who are buried here.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’ll wait here for you.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: She is not there. The coffin is gone.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Maybe you’ve got the wrong crypt �� after
all it’s twenty years when you wore last here.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: This was the place.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: There was no house here.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht’s voice</strong>: Come in, come in!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I took it for granted you gentlemen were
refugees as are my other guests.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander
of the Third Army. I’m Oliver Davis. To be perfectly frank with you, we
didn’t expect to find anyone living here.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: It is my home. My name is Hugo
Albrecht.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I have not been on the island in twenty
years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves – the
coffins?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: This was once a cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: It may seem an odd choice for a home. Yet
I like it. But you must meet my guests.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: This is Mr. St. Aubyn, British Consul from
Adrianople.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: – and Miss St. Aubyn.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You were singing, weren’t you? A beautiful
voice, Miss St. Aubyn.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: That was my companion. She sings little
peasant songs quite nicely – a completely untrained voice, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: My secretary, Miss Wollsten.</p>
<p><strong>jacks</strong>: Jacks – Henry Jacks. Tinware, best grade and
the lowest prices – Jacks sells no junk.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Aren’t you a little out of your
territory?</p>
<p><strong>jacks</strong>: If the world won’t come to Jacks, Jacks goes
to the world.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Mr. Jacks is a philosopher. But, come, sit
down with us. We are all anxious to hear of’ today’s battle.</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: A fine fight, sir, but a bit inconvenient
for travel. We were under constant shelling all the way down the
coast.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: The enemy is in retreat. There will be no
more fighting here. I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried
here. What happened to the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: They were gore before I came here.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: There was some trouble here ��the
villagers on the mainland �-this island was the focal point of their
anger. They came here ��broke open the tombs and despoiled the
graves.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: All the graves?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I’m afraid so. There were rumors ��people
were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old
superstitions.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I donut understand.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I can explain, Master Soldier.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Vorvolakas!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You are an old fool.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You think so? You think such things do not
happen? Right now �� upstairs there is one who is rosy and bright ��
full of blood – and here �� �� here is one who is pale and cold as a
lily.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You are still a fool.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You know the Greek legends, you drink the
Greek wine, but you are not a Greek.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: But the gods played a little trick on me.
I was born in Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You collect these to sell, abroad?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: No more. One day I stood in the Royal
Museum at Munich and watched the fat burghers and their brood�mare wives
staring and poking at my beautiful trophies. Now I am content just to
live �� here in the heart of a vanished world.</p>
<p><strong>jacks</strong>: I wish it’d vanish, I do. I’d give every
bloomin’ statue in the place for one whiff of fish ‘n’ chips �- for one
peek at Piccadilly.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Each to his taste.</p>
<p><strong>jacks</strong>: I’m going back, first boat to England. I’m
going back and hear the sound of Bow Bells. I’m not well. I’m not well.
Something’s wrong with me ��something hurts.</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: Odd way to describe plain
drunkenness.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: He fell.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: That’s a strong wine �� poor fellow, I
should have warned him.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: There – you’re all right, now �� we have
you ��</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Never mind. It’ll get him to his room.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: My dear sir, you look completely
exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: He is exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Why don’t you stay here tonight? Get a
good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I’ll get Ida to make up your bed.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some
kind of an unofficial observer �� a correspondent of some sort ��</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: And the soldier – He looked at me so strangely
– who is he?</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: I don’t really know where Thea comes
from. The Vice�Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Her name is Thea?</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: Theodosia.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Her family name?</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: Damn me, if I know. She’s become so much
a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea –
she has a last name –</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: I seem to have forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You do not know her last name – you do not
know from where she came?</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: Miss Wollsten -� my secretary, she’d
know.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Your daughter is ill.</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: She’s not too well.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: What is her illness?</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: Nothing, really. She’s been under a great
strain – the journey – the battle –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Was she ill before that girl came into your
household?</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: Why – no not before Thea came ��</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Your daughter is weak – she feels as if the
blood had been drained from her – and all this since that girl came to
work in your house.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: This girl –</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: This girl – Thea �- is not a servant in
my household, sir. She is my daughter’s companion. Now, sir, if you’ll
excuse me, I’ll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I will go with you.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one
piece.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: M~ father will take care of it. Pappa is
wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe. I
could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: You are fortunate in your father.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Thea is an orphan.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: That was a lovely song you sang before we
came. Sing it again, will you?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I adore hearing Thea sing – but my poor
head’s beginning to ache. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I
go?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: You have a chill! You must have a glass of
wine.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You can imagine the General’s disappointment
when he found his wife’s body gone.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Then we heard you singing –it was so strange
and eerie in a place where we had thought there was only the dead.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I was thinking of death when I sang.</p>
<p><strong>cathy-</strong>: Thea!</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: You’re making me feel cold.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Perhaps my scarf –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You blew out the light – to see better in
the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: And your hands are cold �- cold as dead
hands.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You. You know me?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Swear it. By your winding shroud, do you
swear it?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Maybe you have no memory for the past ��
Vrykolaka!</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Christ be with me ��</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You thought me a Vrykolaka -�a vampire -
-</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Look – I am alive.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: And I thought the same of you! I am
ashamed. A grown man –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: We of the mountain villages are strange
people. There are too many old dreams in our blood, eh?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Then you can understand – you can forgive
me.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: General ��</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: What do they call you? What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Nikolas Pherides.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: The sea! The sea!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: What made you say that, Thea?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: “The sea �- the sea.” Those were the very
words of Xenophon and the ten thousand - - do you know about them,
Thea?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You don’t have to. It’s inside of you –
all the glory that was Greece -� the dancing, the singing and the white
marble –</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all
that in our simple Thea… She is quite pretty, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: This was the temple of Hades –the God of
the Dead. It contained no images – just empty space and walls of perfect
symmetry.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: How disappointing! I expected it was
something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: The Greeks thought death was beautiful –
an adventure –a journey to another world. But I have my other guests to
think of – The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you’ll
excuse me –</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Cathy �- how does it feel to have a
father?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: What an odd question!</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I mean, does one love a father because he is
good and kind -�or just because he is one’s father?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Why, I love my father because - because I do.
Of course, he’s nice to me.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Thea – you’re hiding something. Why do you
suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him –
didn’t know him –</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I do not know him, but I have seen him.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: What is it – what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: You have forgotten my last name?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I have forgotten it, dear.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: My last name is Pherides.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You are a happy man Oliver. You have but
one world to live in �- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have
that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was
brought up and a new world which the army gave me �� a world of
mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It doesn’t seem to bother you much,
General.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I will be glad to leave this island. It has
too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and
that girl ��</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Thea?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: There is something evil about her.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oh, now �� now look here ��</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I know all you are going to say �-I have
been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She
resembles my wife -�there is something about her ��the way she moves ��
the way she turns her head.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: But that should make you like her.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: It makes me fear her.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I can’t understand that.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: It is not necessary to understand. We are
leaving and I am thankful.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Thea, your choice is a very simple one.
Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: But one must love a father.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: The General � you don’t even know him.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Come, Thea, if you’re going to claim him as
your father you’ve got to make up your mind. They’ll be leaving any
minute.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I don’t know. As a child. I longed for a
father and now �- I don’t know ��</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Do you like what you’ve seen, of him’?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I felt he did not like me.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: That should decide it or you –</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is
to all my mother’s people. I turn my hand against him.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Well, at any rate, I would like to say
goodbye to the girl.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: We have no time for that.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Wait, gentlemen! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I need your advice �� something has
happened �� Mr. Jacks ��</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Drunk again?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: He’s dead. I want the General to see
him.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: If you wish.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: He was going back to hear the sound of Bow
bells. He’ll never hear them again.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: He complained of not feeling well. I thought
he was drunk �� he staggered.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: That staggering. His dying so quickly. In
your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died,
who talked incoherently �� walked blindly.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I’ve seen men die drunk �- and I’ve seen
men die of the plague.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Plague? There’s no possibility of that, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence.
He follows the wars.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I’m not sure that it is the plague.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: We will know when the next one sickens.
Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my
troops.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: In the meantime it would be useless to
alarm the others. Let them think it was a normal And, perhaps it was �-
perhaps it was.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I’m glad you and the General didn’t have to
leave us. We would feel quite deserted..</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: How could we go back to the wars with such
pleasant company here..</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: You’re feeling better, Cathy? I must
admit your island is peaceful enough. Even I have relaxed.. In fact, I
feel quite exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Perhaps you should rest for a little
while, Mr. St. Aubyn.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Pappa is so strong. Not a bit like me. Even
as a child, I was delicate. Then Mamma died, everyone thought I should
die, too.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Thea, you’ve hardly said a word all through
dinner. I feel something strange in the house �� cold.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You’re afraid because Mr. Jacks is
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: The dead are dead.. They can do no harm.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Miss Thea complains of the cold. Let’s go
to the fire.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: St. Aubyn?</p>
<p><strong>st. aubyn</strong>: An excellent wine, no doubt, but it has
rather a curious brassy taste in my mouth. No I really quite tired.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Good night, Pappa.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Did you hear what Thea said – as if she
knew what threatens us.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: That’s impossible. I told them Jacks died
of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Did your servant got word to
Dr. Drossos?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Dr. Drossos should be here any hour
now.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: If you’ll forgive me…I’ve letters to
write.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I’ve just been admiring Thea’s headdress. I
think I shall have a hat made like it a little round cap with a veil
��</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Good night, Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Sleep well.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: You’re not leaving tomorrow..?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I think not.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Until we know, what choice is there? We
have to stay.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: But the war, the army �� they need you.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Better no general than one carrying the
plague.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: We still don’t know that it’s the plague
��</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what
to do then.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I wonder if my editor’s psychic? Reports
from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Or even spirit messages from the next
world.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I suppose a war correspondent could get the
plague. Well, I’d better try for some sleep �- while I’m alive to enjoy
it. Good night, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Mr. Davis -�</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Will you help me? Mr. St. Aubyn is
ill �- very ill</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: His room is down here, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: If he’s not dead, he’s certainly a sick
man.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: No. No. I won’t believe it. He’s not
dead.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer
of my division.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I don’t care who he is. He doesn’t
know. He can’t tell ��</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: I’ll make any test you want. Look.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: He’s not dead. I tell you he’s not
dead.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: If there is the finest breath of life
it will cloud a mirror.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: The breath can stop, the heart can
stop �� it still doesn’t mean death. Men have lived –</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: Quite right. In cataleptic trance, a
man may live for days with no visible sign of life. The breath
suspended,the heartbeat stilled– But this man is dead.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: What difference does it make? Covered or
uncovered, the eyes see no more.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: We are faced with a very serious form
of plague. Its first symptoms are dizziness, nausea, weakness, inability
to focus the eyes or control the limbs. This is followed by acute
spasms, sometimes blindness, and finally, in moat cases, death.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I don’t want to hear any more. You can’t keep
me here. This horrible island �� it has cost me my father �� it will
kill all of us.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I will not have the plague carried to my
troops. No one leaves here �not you, not I, not anyone.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: The doctor only wants us to know the worst,
for our own good. Besides, he holds out some hope –</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: If the wind shifts, if the sirocco
blows – the hot wind from the South – all danger will be over in
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Good winds and bad winds!</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: The disease is transmitted by fleas and
their bodies are eighty percent moisture. The hot wind literally burns
them away.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: The ancient Greeks had just as good an
explanation – that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for
harboring Vrykolaka –</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: They used to believe that sort of thing
in the mountain villages. Some still do –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I do not.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: If you have nothing more to tell us,
will you excuse me �-</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: She’s right. This is hardly the time to
bandy old tales.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I have lived long enough to doubt
everything – which is to say, I believe everything, a little.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: You’re just talking nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Let us put it to the test. Protect
yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I’ll go out
on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes – not that I believe in
him any more than I do in Science.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: We will see who is the first to die.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: Very well. I’ll wager a dinner.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I know it must be hard. But you have
relatives in London –you’ve got a whole world of living, ahead of you
–</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: No one can take my father’s place.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: My handkerchief -� I think I must have lost
it �- perhaps when we were in the grove. Thea!</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You can’t go down there alone - -</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Cathy –</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I wish I didn’t have such bitter
knowledge of you, Cathy.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Whet do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: They were talking about the
Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that’s what you are �� a weak, pale,
half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to
live.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Miss Wollsten!</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: You and your mysterious illness. A
new attack everytime you are crossed � everytime you can’t get your own
way.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Your father knew it too. But he was
never sure how much was pretense.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: How do you know what my father thought -
-</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Your father loved me. He wanted to
marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You
spoiled his life ��you’ve ruined mine ��</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: You were father’s secretary -� I never
thought - -</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Didn’t you? But now – what are you
thinking now?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: What would I be thinking?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Mr. Davis seems a good prospect
��young handsome, sympathetic – ready to listen to you and feel sorry
for you - -</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: What if he is?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: ) But Thea – She stands in your way.
I know you. I know your little hints �� the way you can turn the truth
into a lie –</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Why, I’m fond of Thea.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: You’re planing something, Cathy.. But
I won’t let you �- I’ll warn them against you.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: You will not say one single word. I know your
secret.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: That your father and I ��</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: No. I mean your other secret -� the one you
kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London – he told
me.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Thea.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You’re crying. Why?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I don’t know. Everything’s so mixed up –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Everything’s so simple. I like you.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: What’s bothering you, Thea? Is it the
General?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange
way, I’m afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Don’t let it trouble you. He’s an old man
and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won’t
harm you.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You gave us quite a start – standing
there.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Tomorrow they move on to engage the enemy
�� to beat him back across the Bosphorus.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It’s hard going, General. You wanted to lead
them. Here you are quarantined just because you wanted to pray at your
wife’s side �� and even her body is gone.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Thea is so like her �� in every feature
��</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: If she looked like Thea, she must have been
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: She was beautiful. There was blood between
her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I
saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: How did she die?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I don’ t know. When I was gone the people
from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away
with them. Months later she came back ��pale – sick – she died –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Is this what you wanted to speak to me
about?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: In a way – this girl, Thea. You must stay
away from her.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I had a notion you had become self�appointed
chaperone lately � why?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You are my friend.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: And I’m your friend �� but that doesn’t
explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: If I told you �� you wouldn’t believe me –
but this much I can tell you �� the girl is dangerous to you. Take a
friend’s advice – an old man’ s advice – leave her alone -�</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: That’s ridiculous – Thea’s lovely, gentle
�-</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Listen to what I say –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: When you make sense I’ll listen.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Where’s Thea?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I think she went to bed �� I saw her going
toward the house</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Let the doctor guard us against the plague
�- I shall stand guard against the other things – the things we cannot
understand.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I suppose you want to hear my prayer to
Hermes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: I just came to see if your prayer would
entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You’re too late, my friend. I have already
made my prayers. And how about your scientific efforts?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: Also too late. I owe you a dinner.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: ) You feel the symptoms?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: My friend – what can one say –</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: You can have your servants prepare a
dinner. That is the way I’ll meet my old- familiar enemy – Death –I have
fought him before. I’ve won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at
my own banquet.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: When I was a young man, I prescribed
moderation in all things. Especially wine.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: When I was young a man was measured by the
skins of wine he could empty.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: And then - - the Vrykolaka will get you, if
you don’t watch out…</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Oh, no -� it’s too delicious! You’re making
it up!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: On my word! That’s what they believe.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Please.. You shouldn’t laugh –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You see? Thea believes it, too!</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Tell me about them, Thea. They have great
wings end long teeth –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Sharp, shiny teeth – and they creep up to
your bed –</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Closer and closer �- until they bite into
your throat!</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Oh, my poor simple Thea! Did you ever see
anything so ludicrous?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: Thea! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: Look at her. Warm, beautiful - alive.
Drink with me, Thea -� Drink to my old enemy, who wins at last –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: There is only one place where the women
bewitch one with their beauty.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Everything’s dead in here, dead and empty.
Out there; the night is alive.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Someone should go with him. He’s has had too
much to drink.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I think Thea is steady enough for
both. She has not had too much to drink.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: Don’t go. You are leaving me, you are
all leaving me –</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I’m here. The General is here. You are not
alone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drossos</strong>: I must meet him with laughter - with
songs and laughter – to show him I am not afraid –</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: He is dying.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: When she stood beside him, I knew. I could
feel death in the room.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Oliver –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: What is it, Cathy? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: My father – I’m alone, Oliver, completely
alone!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Poor Cathy –</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Last night Dr. Drossos – today you or I – oh,
no, Oliver, it can’t be you, I couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: There’s no reason to decide any of us are
going to die.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: If only we could get away - - you and I. The
others are strangers, they mean nothing to me</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: We have to get away, we have to live. I have
no one in the world – you must stay with me, care for me�</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: We’ll talk later, when you’re yourself
again.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: The wind has not changed.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Poor child. These must be horrible days for
you.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I’m so ill, I’m so exhausted – I almost don’t
care.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You look so pale this morning, as if all
your blood were drained away.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Has that girl – has Thea ever told you
where she comes from?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Some village in the mountains – Alethera, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Has she spoken to you of her father and her
mother?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: She has never mentioned her family.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: How old is she?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I don’t know — fairly young.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: The sun is so strong here.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You have deceived me long enough. Now I
have found out. You are from Alethera – from where I took you and from
where you came to die - - to die without dying - -</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Why are you making up these things - - why are
you wishing evil on me? You know who I am, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I wish I didn’t know. I wish I had never
found you again.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I knew you hated me and my people – but I
didn’t know your hatred was so bitter –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: It isn’t hatred. I couldn’t hate you.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I failed you twenty years ago. Now, I’ve
come to do what must be done.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: To take me with you?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: No - - no – to do what I should have
done.</p>
<p><strong>oliver’s voice</strong>: Thea –</p>
<p><strong>oliver’s voice</strong>: Thea –</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I’m here..</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I watched you – you’ve bewitched him. But
he is my friend. You’ll not do to him what you have done to the young
English girl.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Thea, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: The General threatened me.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn’t be
too angry with him, Thea. He’s an old man and now with all this trouble
�� the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory
– cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the
things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain
village.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: He keeps asking for the name of my father and
mother.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Well, tell, him.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Why in the world can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: He hates all my race.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I knew that feuds still went on, but I
didn’t think people like you and the General would be involved.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: It is more than a feud between two families.
He stole my mother away from her people.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Thea, what is this? What are you trying to
tell me? “He stole your mother” �-</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: It is for that he hates me.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I don’t think so, Thea. He has spoken of
your mother. I don’t believe he knows you are his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Then why does he persecute me? My family told
me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her
–</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: They didn’t tell you the whole truth. Why do
you think your mother went back to him after you were born?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Because she loved him. I know him, Thea.
Believe me, he is not a cruel man.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I
felt that I had wronged him. But then –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Let me tell him. When he knows you are his
child, he’ll forget these insane notions -�</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: No – you musn’t. He thinks I’ve bewitched you.
He won’t believe it �- he’ll hate me even more! My only chance is to
stay away from him.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Perhaps you are right. He’s not himself now.
We’ll wait �� and in the meantime, don’t be afraid I’ll take care of
you..</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Woman, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I wanted to be sure of something,
General – something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror
of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in �- entombed
�� imprisoned..</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine
glass in his hand – he died laughing – a brave man, Drossos, like his
father before him.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Because he was a brave man - because
I liked him – I came here to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: He’s dead enough. God rest his soul.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: General -�</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I’m a woman – a lonely woman. I have
few friends.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I have not had a happy life –but that
one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep �- I
want to avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I don’t understand you.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I don’t want to be buried alive. If I
die I want to be sure �- quite sure.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: If you should fall sick we’ll be careful.
You need not worry.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: No, I want more than that. I beg you
General, make sure –drive a knife through my heart – anything.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You ask that of me? You’re afraid to live
in your coffin. You know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: That’s superstition. That’s something
out of old tales – about the dead who live �- I’m talking of something
else –cataleptic attacks – apparent death that is not real.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Never fear – when you are dead you will
remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I
promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will
watch you both. Never fear.</p>
<p><strong>cathy’s voice</strong>: General -�</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I was looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I have been troubled about you. I want you
to know that my room is just downstairs – You have only to cry out if
you are ill �� or frightened.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: How kind you are. It is so comforting to know
that someone cares.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You no longer have your father �- And I
have no children.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: No, that’s Thea’s bed. Miss Wollsten’s bed is
in there.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I’ll see you at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: I’ve always known what an evil mind
lay behind that pretty weak face of yours �� but this, Cathy – even I
would never have believed it is of you.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Would you care to explain what you’re talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: You’ve been playing on the
superstitions of that poor old man � � working at him � � turning him
against Thea.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Really, this is idiotic!</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: You’d do anything to get Oliver away
from Thea. But I’m going to stop you. I’m going to tell Mr. Davis
exactly what you are.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: And what makes you think he’ll believe you,
when I tell him what you are - - what part you played in my father’s
life –</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: When I tell him that you’re unfit to live a
normal life with normal people �- a cataleptic!</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: You wouldn’t tell that ��</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Wouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Then tell them! You’re despicable, a
monster of vanity with heart for no one but yourself. Tell them
everything – but I will tell them too �- and you’ll lose, Cathy – you
understand – you’ll lose!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: It has been brisk and warm today. Take
comfort We always have these perfect days before the sirocco blows.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Where is Miss Wollsten?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: She’s in her room.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I’ll get her –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: If Mr. Albrecht is right, we’ll all be free
in a few days. I suppose you’ll be going on to Athens?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I don’t know now without my father.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You are right. You shouldn’t be traveling
alone. Why don’t you make the trip with her?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’d like to, very much – but it depends on
what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: In case you do so, would you –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: She is dead.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: There are no marks.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Help me put her on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I want to make those tests that Dr. Drossos
made. I promised her.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht’s voice</strong>: Her heart is stopped – there is no
breath.</p>
<p><strong>general’s voice</strong>: Nothing. There is a way to make
sure -�</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: No. We can do without that.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Another sad task. We’ll bury her tomorrow.
I think we’d better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: No. She shall not be left here.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Maybe you’re right. Help me get something
to carry her downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: General! The wind — look the wind has
changed to the South.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It’s the sirocco – we’ll be able to get away
from here – you can take command of your army</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I have had command for the last time �-</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Come �- you’ll feel yourself again as soon
as we get off this dismal island.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I shall not leave the island ��</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’m going to get Albrecht. Watch the General
for me.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: The wind has changed. There’s no more
danger for the army. You can go.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: It’s getting dark. I can’t leave now.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: In the morning – go. I’ll not die until
then �- I’ll not die �� I’ll watch -� they shall not hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Shh��� it’s all right -� I’ll be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: They shall not hurt you</p>
<p><strong>general’s voice</strong>: Vrykolaka – Vrykolaka –</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Vrykolaka!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It doesn’t look much like the fish spears I
knew back in Marblehead..</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Our friend, Poseidon, didn’t use it for
fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’ll go up and take a look at the General �-
perhaps sit with him.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: He won’t even know you’re there. He is
delirious.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: All the more reason to watch him. He’s had
some wild notions lately.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Don’t bother. Go to bed and get some
sleep. I’ll be working late. I can hear any movement down here.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Well ��</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Go ahead. I’ll wake you up when I go to
bed. Then you can watch him.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Thank you, I’ll do that. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close
your eyes. Try to forget everything.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I
can’t think of anything else.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: She is dead � at peace.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Suppose, she isn’t dead. Suppose it was a
cataleptic attack?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: It was, the plague</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: We quarreled. She never dared get angry or
frightened – but I said things to her – it was an attack, I know it
was.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Then let us go to her, Cathy. We’ll make sure
� and your mind will be at rest.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Oh, no �- I couldn’t Thea. I couldn’t go into
the crypt. I’m afraid, you know I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: I’ll be back soon. Don’t worry anymore,
Cathy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the convergence of the paths leading to the grove
and</strong>: THE CRYPTS - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Who is there?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Is that you, Oliver?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Cathy?</p>
<p><strong>miss wollsten</strong>: Cathy!</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Thea?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Oh -� sleeping – Oliver wouldn’t like
that. Well, everything seems to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Vrykolaka.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Theodosia –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Not Theodosia. Theodosia’s daughter – your
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Daughter – my daughter –</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: She was born before your wife returned here
to die. You never knew.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: With Poseidon’s trident she paid her way
to Hades. He let her pass through the portals into his dark realm.</p>
