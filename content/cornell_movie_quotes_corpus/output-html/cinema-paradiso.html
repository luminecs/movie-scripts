<p><strong>maria</strong>: …Salvatore, that’s right, Salvatore. Di Vita
Salvatore …But, miss, what do you mean you don’t know him?!…I…Yes… She
has dialed her way through endless numbers but still hasn’t managed to
speak to Mr. Di Vita. She finally heaves a …That’s right, good for you!
Oh!…yes…And I’m his mother. I’m calling from Sicily. Been trying all
day…Ah, he’s not there…But would you be so kind as to give me…?…Yes…
around forty sitting nearby: it is LIA, her daughter, who jots down the
numbers her …Six, five, six, two, two, oh, six…Thanks ever so
much…Goodbye. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>lia</strong>: Look, Ma…It’s useless calling him. He’ll be
terribly busy, God knows where he is. Besides he might not even
remember. Do as I say, forget it…He hasn’t been here for thirty years.
You know how he is.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He’ll remember! He’ll remember! and starts
dialing …I’m positive. I know him better than you do. If he were to find
out we hadn’t told him, he’d be angry. I know. …Hello? Good morning.
Could I please speak to Mr. Salvatore Di Vita. I’m his mother…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey! What the fuck you looking at!?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Salvatore…But what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: It’s late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn’t
able to let you know I wouldn’t be corning… tired, feels like Go to
sleep now. Sleep.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Your mother phoned. She took me for somebody
else…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: And what’d you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I played dumb, so as not to disappoint her.
We had a nice little talk. She says you never go see her, and when she
wants to see you she has to come to Rome…Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: She phoned just to say that?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: She said a certain Alfredo had died. And the
funeral’s taking place tomorrow afternoon… comes into SALVATORE’S eyes.
The idea of going to sleep has clearly left him. It’s a piece of news he
didn’t expect. That’s taken him off-guard. CLARA would like to carry on
the conversation, but sleepiness makes it almost impossible. An she can
manage is one last question in a faint little Who is it? A relative of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No. Sleep. Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Pss! Pssst!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: But how can I make you understand? Without
the bell I just can’t go on! Always half asleep, you are! What do you do
at night anyway? Eat instead of sleep?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Father, at my house we don’t even eat at
noon. That’s why I’m always sleepy. That’s what the vet says.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: All right, Toto, get moving, I’ve got things
to do. Say hello to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Can I…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: And don’t ask if you can come… Because you
can’t!! Shoo, shoo, off with you!!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: OK, Alfredo, you can start!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: You must not come here! How many times do I
have to tell you? reels with his hand. The slips of paper are about to
arrive. If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you’d go up in a
burst of flame…whoosh! And turn into a piece of…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: …and turn into a piece of charcoal!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Christ, that’s a sassy little tongue you’ve
got! Watch out, or someday I’ll snip it off.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Can I have it?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: No!!! Are you deaf or something? I’ve got
to put this back in when we wind up the film again! You’re a real pain
in the neck!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Then why didn’t you put these back when
you wound up the films again?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: ’Cause sometimes you can’t find the right
place any more and so…well, actually…they stay here. Besides, there are
more kisses than you can count.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: So I can have these? off the handle. He
grabs SALVATORE by the shoulders</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the
way to China and back, let’s make a deal. These strips here are yours, I
give them to you. However! One you’re not to stick your nose in here any
more. Two I’ll keep them for you, because you can’t take them home for
God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break
loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: What sort of deal is this? The strips are
mine! So why can’t I come see them?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Get out!! And don’t show your face here
again!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think
later! This is no job for weaklings! Treacherous dog!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Hey there, you lousy bastard, take your
hands off that gold, You black- hearted pig, stay away from me, or I’ll
smash your face in! ’Ntantatah!!!… frames there are also several
photographs. SALVATORE picks them up. Family keepsakes. A man in an army
uniform. Then the same man with a girl beside him whose smiling face can
be recognized as MARIA. SALVATORE takes a closer look at the man’s face,
then whispers to his Ma, if the war’s over, how come Daddy’s never come
back?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He’ll be back, he’ll be back… You’ll see. One
of these days…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I don’t remember him any more�Ma, where’s
Russia?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It takes years to get there. And years to
come back…Now go to bed, Toto, it’s late.</p>
<p><strong>masino’s father</strong>: You can fool your mother but not
me! Get yourself a damn diploma and become a policeman. You good-for-
nothing!</p>
<p><strong>masino</strong>: I don’t want to go to school’ The black
lines move up the steps towards the</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Well then?! Five times five equals…?</p>
<p><strong>cola</strong>: Thirty!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Silence!! The five times table. Dunce! One
times five, five!! the TEACHER, in a sing-</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Five times five?</p>
<p><strong>cola</strong>: Forty…?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’m asking you for the last time,
blockhead! Five times five equals…? smiling eyes and answers</p>
<p><strong>cola</strong>: Christmas!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I bought a ticket. I’ve come to see the
film. up behind him and grabs him by the collar, and he almost jumps out
of his</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: Go sit downstairs! You good-for- nothing
sponger! ! Worse than rabbits they are!</p>
<p><strong>first old man</strong>: Hello, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Ssssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!</p>
<p><strong>first old man</strong>: Can’t I say hello?</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: It’s a double-feature today.</p>
<p><strong>first old man</strong>: I couldn’t care less. I come here to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: For Christ’s sake! Cut it, Alfredoooo!</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Grrrr! Grrrrr!</p>
<p><strong>second old man</strong>: Greetings to one and all!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: SSSSSH’ Drop dead! Silence! Hey, kids,
we’re here to see the film!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Ahhh! What a shame! I’ve been going to the
movies for twenty years and I never saw a kiss!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: And when will we see one?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’ve been looking for you all day. Did you
buy the milk?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Then where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Somebody stole it.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What’d you do with the money? Go to the
movies?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Signora Maria, don’t do that. He’s just a
kid. And why are you telling fibs? We let him in free. He must have lost
the money inside the movie theatre… in amazement, goes on How much did
you have?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Fifty lire…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: What you find tonight on the floor between
the seats? his pockets, pulls out</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: A comb, two heel-savers, a box of tobacco…
reaches out with fifty lire he has taken from his pocket. And like a
magician he draws the money out of</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: …and fifty lire! See? under the USHER’S</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-
night.</p>
<p><strong>idiot</strong>: It’s midnight. I’ve got to shut down the
square! Go away. The square’s mine! The square’s mine!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Good morning, father. It’s hard on the
feet, huh?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Yeah!…Getting there’s downhill and all the
saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you,
that’s all! God’s will be done.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Ouch! Ouch! My foot! I can’t walk!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo, did you know my father?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Of course I knew your father. He was tall,
thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked
like Clark Gable.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo, now that I’m older, I’m not
saying I can start coming to the projection booth, to the movie
house…But…maybe, why don’t we become friends?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: ‘I choose my friends for their looks, and
my enemies for their brains…’ You’re too smart to be my friend. Besides,
as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But you don’t have any kids!!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: All right, all right! When I’ve got kids
that’s what I’m telling them! Giancaldo finally heave</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Stop crying…The fire is out…I’m here…That’ll
do, that’ll do… come up behind them. SALVATORE has barely leapt off the
bicycle when his mother sails into him like Miserable boy! You’re the
ruin of me! Your sister would have been burnt alive if I hadn’t been
there! And all your fault!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: But aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Uncle
Alfredo, playing with a little boy at your age?!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: But…what’s it got to do with me?…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And who gave him all those films? Promise you
won’t give him any more of this trash! Don’t let him set foot any more
in the movie house. The boy’s crazy! Crazy! All he talks about is movies
and Alfredo’ Alfredo and movies!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: I give you my word, Donna Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: God’s got to grant me one wish! Send your
father back home! And he’ll see you get what’s coming to you! hands,
looks at her and with the dreadful</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Daddy’s not coming back…He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It’s not true! No! It’s not true!!! I’ll show
you he’s coming back!</p>
<p><strong>blacksmith</strong>: Ah! I’ll wring all your necks!! Or my
good name means nothing! !! Lousy brats!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Signora Anna!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Your wife told me to bring you this.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Give it to me!…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I told my mother you weren’t the one who
gave me the films. That it wasn’t your fault. But I thought you said the
film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won’t steal
any more from you. That’s all I wanted to say. I’m going. ALFREDO takes
him by the shoulder and stops</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Toto, come here.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Now listen to what I’ve got to say. I took
up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren’t
these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by
hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It
was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down’ boom!
Everything would go up in flames!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Then why don’t you want to teach it to me
too? Now that there’s no more cranking, and it’s easier?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Because I don’t want to, Toto! This is not
a job for you. It’s like being a slave. You’re always alone. You see the
same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And
you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work
on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free.
But if they hadn’t put Jesus Christ on a cross…You’d work Good Fridays
too!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Then why don’t you change jobs? He
reaches out to turn the knob of the carbon rods. He gazes at SALVATORE
as if he were a grown-up, somebody who’s making</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Because I’m an idiot. How many other guys
in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could
do it. Besides I wasn’t lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When
I grew up, another war! Now it’s all different. Times have changed. And
you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Good for you, Toto. Good for you… I’m only
saying this for your own good… all the while, goes into a closet with a
bucket in it, the toilet of the booth. He turns his back Cooped up in
here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You
breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. him, but
taking advantage of the fact he can’t be seen, he turns the knob of the
carbon rods, just as he had seen done a moment</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But don’t you like anything about what
you do? photos on the wall: Keaton, Garbo, Snow White. ALFREDO smiles to
himself. Sure, there’s something about</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: With time…you get used to it. Besides, when
you hear from up here that there’s a full house and that people are
laughing, having fun… Then you’re happy too. thought, doesn’t notice
that the documentaries and cartoons have finished. The screen is blank.
And down in the theatre laughter is not heard but an uproar of whistling
and swearing. SALVATORE’S eyes sparkle, he seizes the opportunity. He
turns on the lights and stops the projector, just as ALFREDO would have
done. At which ALFREDO buttons up his pants in a hurry and rushes over
alarmed, but sees that everything is in order. SALVATORE looks at him
all smiles, as if he expected a medal for civil bravery. Instead,
ALFREDO reacts like a wild So I’ve been wasting my breath? You pretend
to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you
want! Get out of here! I don’t want to lay eyes on you again! This is
the last straw! Your mother’s right, you’re crazy!! stairs. SALVATORE
suddenly vanishes, scared out of his wits. ALFREDO talks to himself, in
a But how’d he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he’s learned!
It’s incredible! window, yelling, as he sees SALVATORE running through
the I’m letting the box office know you’re not to set foot even into the
theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I’m also talking to
Father Adelfio! You won’t be an altar boy any more either!!! You little
runt! Hates him. Yells something</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! out by the
sudden shouting of the people outside the</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Goal!! Holy Mother of God!!! crumples to the
ground. The others swarm around him, alarmed. They hold up his head. His
face is pale. They check the coupon he is clutching in his hand. A voice
rises like a siren from the</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Ciccio Spaccafico’s won the Sisal!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>spectator’s voice</strong>: The Neapolitan’s won the
lottery!!! Let’s go see, kids!!! Northerners are always lucky! up and
heads for the exit. Pushing. Shouting.</p>
<p><strong>examining board member</strong>: A merchant owns two stores.
In the first he sells fruit and vegetables. In the second he sells nails
and cement…</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Excuse me, professor. Here are the men
taking the exam for the elementary school certificate. Come in, please…
look. A MAN around thirty enters, ill at ease. The children recognize
him and laugh mischievously. The second is the BLACKSMITH, the one who
falls asleep at the movies. The third is a twenty-year-old-boy, ANGELO.
The fourth is ALFREDO, embarrassed and red in the face. SALVATORE is
speechless. Gives a slightly ironic laugh. There is a look of revenge in
his shrewd little</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: YOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this fucking
problem!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Ssssh! Silence back there!!</p>
<p><strong>main floor voice</strong>: Bastard!! Pencil-pusher!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Pay attention. This is where it can easily
catch fire. If it happens, the first thing you’ve got to do is break it
off, here and here, so the whole reel doesn’t go up in fames.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: You understand which side the gelatin’s
on?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: It tastes wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Fraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo! hand-binding.
ALFREDO winds the film, hangs a slip on a nail in the</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: These are the shipping invoices for the
film. They are always to be kept. You see?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: OK, Alfredo.</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Holy Mother! What a face! So ugly!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Now you can run it by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>masino</strong>: Christ, what a piece of ass!!!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Di Francesco, aren’t you saying goodbye to
your schoolmate? head a little shake. The TEACHER leans over to But
why?</p>
<p><strong>di francesco</strong>: My father says he’s a Communist…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Will they really find work in
Germany?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Who knows?…It’s like an adventure. Hope
springs eternal… gives one last wave at the window of the projection
booth.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! leaving a
cloud of dust that envelops the suppressed sobs of the grandparents
standing there waving handkerchiefs. SALVATORE watches the car drive
off. Good thing Germany’s closer than Russia.</p>
<p><strong>commentator</strong>: The Defense Minister has announced a
new listof names of Italian soldiers, so far considered missing and now
confirmed as dead. Families concerned will be notified directly by
military authorities.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: …Unfortunately we don’t know what war
cemetery he’s buried in…This is the form for the pension. If you’d like
to sign it…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Don’t shove! There’s no room! For heaven’s
sake! I can’t give another showing, it’s late!</p>
<p><strong>voices in crowd</strong>: Father Adelfio, we’ve been here for
an hour! There are people inside who’ve seen it twice! ! ! Move on!!
Ouch!! My foot!!!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Open up!!! Father Adelfio!! theatre hears the
uproar.</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Ssssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!! What
the hell! projection booth, ALFREDO and SALVATORE look at the crowd down
below, yelling and complaining. Some of the people look up at</p>
<p><strong>voices in crowd</strong>: Alfredooo! We want to get in!…
Tomorrow you’re taking it off! out as if to say there s</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Why can’t we show the same film
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: It’s got to be sent to another town. And if
we don’t the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Too bad!</p>
<p><strong>carabinieres</strong>: Stop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise
somebody’s going to end up in jail!’ That’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: ‘Joe! A mob doesn’t think, doesn’t know
what it’s doing…’ curious, inquisitive look. Spencer Tracy said it in
Fury. What’d you say if we let these poor devils see the film, Toto? in
amazement, all</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Wonderful! But how can it be done?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: You don’t believe my words, but you’ll have
to believe your own eyes!…And now get your ass off that damn stool,
boy!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Go to the window, boy, and have a look…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo, it’s beautiful. crowd of people
jammed around the entrance to the</p>
<p><strong>voice in crowd</strong>: Hey, look there!! The movie!!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Oh, praise the Lord!! It’s true! Look! The
movie!! There’s Toto!! Hurry! Hurry!…THANKS, ALFRED0000!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Good for you, Alfredo!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Shut the window!! Shut the window! Go to
bed!!</p>
<p><strong>voices in crowd</strong>: Sound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: What do you say, should we make them
happy?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Sure, sure!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Aaaaaaaa! At last!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Do you want to go down there? Go on.</p>
<p><strong>ticket-seller</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen! You have to buy
tickets! Reduced rate!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Fuck off!! The square belongs to everybody!
Out Of the crowd, all</p>
<p><strong>village idiot</strong>: No!!! The square’s mine!!! Come on,
kids, no joking around here!!! Otherwise…</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Heeeelp! Run for your lives!!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: What a pity! Poor Alfredo! What a terrible
thing!! Cheer up, Father, is there something we can do?’</p>
<p><strong>village idiot</strong>: Burnt up…Burnt up.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What’ll we do now! The town will have to get
along without movies! Who’s got the money to rebuild it?</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Cheers’ Congratulations, Don Ciccio!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: To the Cinema Paradiso!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: How’d you solve his being under age?</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: I took out a license as projectionist,
thanks to friends down at the guild offices. But I don’t know a thing
about it. Officially, I do the job… …but Toto earns the money.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Fine. Always be careful, my boy. Don’t ever
go to sleep. Be sure another accident doesn’t happen. Do everything poor
Alfredo taught you. And may God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thanks, Father. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: And now enough of this gloomy
atmosphere. Life goes on! I want to see you happy and smiling!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Ooooooh! They’re kissing!! Look at that!!
Christ, that’s news!!</p>
<p><strong>anna’s voice</strong>: Toto?…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Any room for me in this Cinema
Paradiso?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Come in, Alfredo.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Toto, will you bring him home when you close
down?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Yes. Signora Anna. I’m glad you came.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: How’s school?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: OK. OK. But now that I’ve got a job, I’11
probably stop going…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Don’t do that…Sooner or later you’ll be
left empty-handed.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Why? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Toto, this isn’t for you. For the moment,
the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it
won’t last…Some day you’ll have other things to do, more important
things… touches SALVATORE’S face That’s right, more important. I know
it. Now that I’ve lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn’t
see before… from SALVATORE’s face, we see that he is now a young man,
and that ALFREDO is And it’s all thanks to you, who saved my life. And
I’ll never forget it… understand his strange words. ALFREDO can ‘feel’
And don’t put on that look. I haven’t gone off my head yet. You want
proof?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Yes. I want proof.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: For example, at this moment the film’s out
of focus. Go see.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: It’s hard to explain, Toto…</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Only two days? Are you joking?!… What do
I care if all the copies are reserved?…Catene for only two days in a
place like this! Why, people will eat me alive!… listening is SALVATORE.
He is carrying school books under his ann. In the caf�, several curious
ONLOOKERS laugh as through the caf� window they watch some unemployed
PEASANT MEN dancing together at the club. SPACCAFICO listens nervously,
then shrieks as if he were …I know, I know. But even if I start showing
at eight in the morning it wouldn’t be enough! This is a big town now
and you people at the Titanus know it perfectly well! I’m your sole
agent and if I get pissed off I’ll write straight to Lombardo, in Rome!!
I’ll give you guys a good run-around!! If I get my dander up, I can let
fly, if my name’s Spaccafico!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Don Ciccio, I’ve got an idea…You remember
that old abandoned movie house where they’re supposed to build those
low-rent houses?</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: So what’s that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: The projector’s all rusty, but I could
fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some
seats and bring in a projectionist and we’ll show Catene in two
houses.</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: What the fuck you talking about? You
getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one
copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they’ll do is
cut off my head and play ball with it!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Who says we need two copies?</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: That’s enough now! You’ve seen it ten times!
I need the seats! I wish you’d all get the galloping runs!</p>
<p><strong>carabinieres</strong>: Easy! Easy! Through the emergency
exits, quick! Stop the jabbering!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Now get running and bring me the first
reel. Meanwhile I’ll start showing the news!</p>
<p><strong>boccia</strong>: OK, Toto!</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Quick! Give it to me! Here’s the first
part. Get moving!</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Here you are! Quick, quick!! People are
waiting!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Hey, when’s it starting!! We’ve got
ploughing to do in the morning!! Toto, get a move on!! Heeey!!</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: What are we going to do, Toto? The
whole place here is up in arms. They’ve been waiting more than a half
hour.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Where’s the fucking bastard got to?</p>
<p><strong>spectator</strong>: Let’s get one thing straight, Don Ciccio!
I’m waiting ten minutes more, and if you haven’t started… you’re giving
me my money back!!</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Well said! Well said! We want our money
back!!</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Easy! Easy! What about my showing you
the first part again? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: No! First part, my foot! We want to see
how the story ends!!</p>
<p><strong>pasquale</strong>: I’ve seen the whole works! You want me to
tell you how it ends?</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Nooo! No! Shut up, you jerk!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Boccia! Boccia!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Boccia, what’s wrong? friend. Behind the
bush he discovers BOCCIA humped up between the legs of TERESA, a
prostitute. He moves with all the fury of his young years. SALVATORE has
never seen people making love before Damn you, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>boccia</strong>: Oh, Christ, it’s so good!!!</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: What’d I tell you? It doesn’t catch
fire!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Progress! It always arrives too late!</p>
<p><strong>teresa’s voice</strong>: Come on…That’s right…relax… …Don’t
be scared…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore’s voice</strong>: Is it true that if I bleed I’ve
got to squeeze lemon juice on it?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: …There you are! That’s right, that’s right!
Keep going… learned the lesson. TERESA Ah!!! There, now you’re a real
man! A man! ? A real calf! slackens into a deep sigh</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: You know that one there?</p>
<p><strong>boccia</strong>: She’s new. Not bad though. Nice- looking.
somebody seeking for an idea, some way of picking up a conversation
with</p>
<p><strong>second student</strong>: Her father s the new bank director.
Loaded, luxury and easy living!</p>
<p><strong>first student</strong>: People who jerk off with a shirt so
they won’t get their hands dirty.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Look, you dropped this.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh, thanks. I hadn’t noticed…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: My name’s Salvatore…And yours?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Elena. My name’s Elena.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I…I…The other time at the station.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Chaplin’s Modern Times! Right, Toto?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: That’s right, Modern Times.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: I’ve shown it so many times I know it by
heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife
died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn’t have to close
down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show.
Those are things you never forget… So, Toto, how are these home movies
going? the little projector and a square of light appears on the wall
beside ALFREDO, with the scenes shot in</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Yes. slaughter-house have</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: What is it, what is it? What’s the
picture?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: It’s people in the slaughter-house
killing a calf. There’s blood all over the floor, like a lake. And
through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Now what can you see?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Nothing, there’s nothing. It’s all out of
focus.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Is there a woman?…Tell me the truth…
uncertain, doesn’t know whet to say. A tender look filters through
ALFREDO’s dark glasses. He has obviously caught on and There is a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Yes, it’s a girl I saw at the
station.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: What’s she like? What’s she like?…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: She’s nice. My age…Slender, with long
hair, brunette. She had big blue eyes, a simple expression and a little
beauty mark on her lip, but really tiny. You can only see it close-up.
And when she smiles…She makes you feel…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Eh! Love…what a mystery! projector and
heaves a deep sigh, almost of liberation. ALFREDO’S sympathy does him a
lot of good. It’s nice to be understood. He moves over closer to him.
ALFREDO runs his hand through his I understand you, Toto…The ones with
blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can’t make
friends with them. the way he talks. He didn’t think it was possible to
put into words the things he has felt since meeting ELENA. He nods his
head. Eh, there’s nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the
deeper his footprints. And if he’s in love, he suffers, because he knows
he’s up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man
gets it into his head to do what he wants… his sensitivity, by his
intense, passionate, sweet</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: What you say is wonderful! But sad…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: They’re not my words. John Wayne said it in
Shepherd of the Hills.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Stinking two-timer!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Hi, Elena!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Hi. Why are you running?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No particular reason… eyes. He wants to
tell her all sorts of things, say all the words he has memorized a
thousand times. But now he can’t get them out. His knees tremble. He
does his best to overcome his confusion, but all that comes out Nice
day, huh? them in a cloud of dust and a clap of thunder rends the air.
ELENA laughs, amused by</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Yes, nice day. gazes at her long hair tossed
by the wind. She …I’ve got to go now. Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Bye-bye, Elena. SALVATORE also turns to
leave. Only now is he seized by disappointment, regret at not having
made the best of the opportunity. He talks to …What an idiot! What an
idiot! ‘Nice day’! Christ!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: You probably don’t believe me, but I’m
going to become the leading man in your life. Sure, I don’t look like
Marlon Brando, but look at me, really look at me. Am I really so ugly?
So should I try once more? Maybe It’ll succeed. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Hello, can I speak to Elena, please?</p>
<p><strong>womans voice</strong>: Yes. ELENA’s voice, changes his tone,
turns sweeter, more</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Is that you, Elena?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t recognize your
voice. This is Salvatore, remember?</p>
<p><strong>woman’svoice</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Listen, I know that every time we see
each other I make a fool of myself, but I’m not like that, I swear. It’s
just that when I see you, I feel shy, the right words don’t come to me,
I don’t have the courage to say that all I do is think about you… out.
He’s dripping with sweat, but happy at having That’s right, Elena,
you’re the last thing I think of when I go to sleep and the first when I
wake up in the morning. And at night I always dream of you. I know, it’s
not good on the phone. But please, don’t get me wrong. Because I love
you very much…</p>
<p><strong>woman’svoice</strong>: If you don’t stop phoning her, I’m
calling the police!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But excuse me, who’s speaking?</p>
<p><strong>elena’s mother</strong>: I’m Elena’s mother, you filthy
pig!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I’m sorry, Signora, maybe there’s a
misunderstanding…I…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: And don’t call my daughter any more.
Never!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most
difficult.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But why? There must be some way to make
her understand!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Don’t think about it, Toto. Don’t even try.
With feelings, there’s nothing to understand.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Stop it! I’ve had enough of your sermons!
You act as if you created the world! ALFREDO, who gives a startled jump,
as if it were about to run into him. He raises his voice, panic-</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Heeey! Totooooo! Don’t get pissed off with
me now! Come here! I don’t know where the fuck I have to go. collides
with ALFREDO. SALVATORE fumes, goes over to him listlessly. ALFREDO puts
his hand back on his shoulder and they start walking again. ALFREDO has
calmed down, but his voice And the next time be careful how you talk.
Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world,
in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But
unfortunately such was not the case.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: You see, it s like I say. You always have
an answer for everything.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: I want to make you happy, Toto! I’m going
to tell you a story. SALVATORE’S shoulder. It’s the signal for taking a
rest. They sit in a doorway. ALFREDO starts telling his story, and his
way of speaking is hypnotic, magical. With those eyes lost in empty
space, it’s as if his thoughts and his words came in from some other
dimension, mysterious, Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there
were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the
guards, saw the king’s daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he
immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do
compared with a king’s daughter?!…One day he managed to meet her and
told her he couldn’t live without her. The princess was so struck by the
depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier ‘If you will wait a
hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end
I’ll be yours.’ Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day,
two days, ten, twenty…Every night she looked out of her window, but he
never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him
and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale
and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn’t hold them back. He
didn’t even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept
watch…And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his
chair and left!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No! You mean right at the end?
dumbfounded; that ending has made a deep impression. They</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: That’s right, Toto, right at the end? And
don’t ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I’ll be damned’</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all
times!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt
that is torturing my soul. And you’ve got to help me, because I’ve lost
all peace of mind…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Father, I have sinned…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: We’ll talk about that later.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: But…who…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything’s
normal. I’m Salvatore.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: But Alfredo, what you’re saying is
horrifying!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves
and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot…How is it possible
for…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: There was a terrible rumpus at home. My
mother told my father. And how could you have mistaken my voice?!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Forgive me, Elena. It was stupid of me.
But I had to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: You’re so beautiful, Elena…That’s what I
wanted to tell you. When I meet you, I can’t put two words together
because…you give me the shivers. I don’t know what you do in these
situations, what you’re supposed to say. It’s the first time. But I
think I’m in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Father, I have sinned…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I absolve you in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Go in peace, my daughter. shut in her face.
ELENA is barely able to control her When you laugh, you’re even more
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Salvatore, it’s awfully sweet of you. And
even though I don’t know you, I like you. But…I’m not in love with
you.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I don’t care. I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: For you to fall in love with me too.
Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I’ll come and wait
beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your
window. That’s all. I’ll understand…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You understand now? You see it clearly?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Oh yes, father. Now everything’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: And the next time don’t go around saying
such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can
save you from the fire of Hell!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: But why hasn’t Toto shown up? The movie house
is closed at this hour!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: He had to do something for me…</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero!
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: There’s nothing to worry about. He’s
probably with his friends. Let’s toast!</p>
<p><strong>everybody</strong>: Here’s to you! Here’s to you! Happy New
Year!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: For Toto too, here’s to you!! Happy New Year!
!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Salvatore…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You have a great future as a driver. If they
don’t arrest you first!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: That’s nothing to do with it, it’s the
car that’s still being run in…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: SO now how do we get home?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Hello, Dr Mendola…Hem…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Toto, are you pulling my leg or something?
How is it possible to see this television without film?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Just so, Alfredo. There isn’t any. And if
you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any
fuss…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Could be…But I don’t like this business. It
smells fishy to me.</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: You see what a bright idea, Dr Mendola?
But without the bank loan how could I have bought the machine? If we
don’t get organized around here, in this day and age, we’ll meet the
same end as the Punch and Judy shows!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Could it be your father doesn’t like the
work I do…That my family’s too poor…Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>elena’s mother</strong>: Elena!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: All right! ! For the moment it’s impossible
to see each other…As soon as school is out, we’re going to go stay with
friends in Tuscany. We’ll be there all summer…Maybe if you came up, we
could meet in secret…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But we’re opening the outdoor movie
theatre this summer. What will I do all this time without seeing
you?!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’ll write to you every day. Don’t worry. I
love you. The summer’ll be over and I’ll be back…</p>
<p><strong>elena’s mother</strong>: Elena!</p>
<p><strong>slaughter-house man</strong>: Well, look who’s here!! Cecil
B. De Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you coming to shoot another
film?!?</p>
<p><strong>little boys</strong>: All seats are sold out! Free entrance
and payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!</p>
<p><strong>elena’s voice</strong>: Salvatore, my darling, here the days
never end. I find your name everywhere if I read a book, do a crossword
puzzle, thumb through a newspaper…You’re always before my eyes. Today
I’ve got some rather bad news. At the end of October we’re moving to the
city where I’ll attend the University. It’ll be hard to see each other
every day. But don’t worry, whenever I can get away I’ll always come
running to you, to the Cinema Paradiso.</p>
<p><strong>urchin</strong>: Fuck me! I’ve caught an octopus! An
oooooctopus!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Elena…Elena…Elena…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: When will this shitty summer be over? In
a film it’d already be finished… …Fade-out and cut to a nice
thunderstorm!!! Huh? that’d be perfect!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Elena!…But when…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I got back today. You can’t imagine the
excuses I had to make up to be here…</p>
<p><strong>mailman</strong>: Don Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it
him…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Holy blood of Judas! Now what am I going
to do??!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: So what’d they say?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: The army says that, as a war orphan, I
don’t have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It’s a
bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They’re
sending me to Rome. But they’ll discharge me ten days later. Let’s
go…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: No, Salvatore. You’d better go. It’s my
father.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Good, this way we can finally talk. I’ll
convince him this time.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: He won’t be convinced, Salvatore. He has
other plans for me.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: The son of one of his colleagues. Don’t act
that way. We’ll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema
Paradiso. I’ll be coming with the five o’clock bus.</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Toto, this is no film for the common
herd. One day’ll be more than enough…So tonight, please set up
tomorrow’s film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it
ready.</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Cheer up, Toto. I’ll be here waiting for
you. No one’s taking your job away from you. Don’t worry!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: You weren’t expecting me?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No, Alfredo, I was coming to help
you…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: You were expecting her? Huh? He’s too
worried, too upset. ALFREDO climbs …It’s a nasty business waiting by
yourself. In company it’s better. No?…Then I’ll leave.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo, I need your help!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Open up! Open up! Elenaaa!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: TotooooO! TotooooO!</p>
<p><strong>spectators</strong>: Lights! Christ, what a piece of crap!!
We want OUT money back!!! Heeeeey!! Bandits!!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: But where’d you go, Toto?!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I’m here! Take it easy! Take it easy!
arms, like calming down a little boy who has had a nightmare. Be
whispers, Sit down, sit down… SALVATORE lowers him into a chair, and
asks him the only question upon which Did she come?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: No, nobody came. almost as if to comfort
him in his great</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore! Third
Battalion, Ninth Company, sir!!!</p>
<p><strong>second lieutenant</strong>: One, two, one, two!! Attention!
Left march!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten days
here and it’s been about a year, and I haven’t ever gone borne. I’d like
a furlough, at least!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Elena…Elena…Elena… extreme of suffering,
a young man who has been denied love and affection, his rights, freedom.
A NURSE comes</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your discharge
has come through.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: You ’re thinner…You can tell you’ve not
been treated well. anything from ALFREDO. SALVATORE senses something
different in him that he can’t figure out, like same wild restlessness
.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: They tell me you never go out, never talk
to anybody. Why?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Toto, sooner or later there comes a time
when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it’s better to shut
up. It’s hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: At the Christmas party the lieutenant
pinches a girl’s ass. The girl turns around: it’s the daughter of the
commanding officer. The lieutenant is scared to death and says: ’Miss,
if your heart is as hard as what I have just touched, I’m done for!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Did you ever see her again? away, taken
off-guard as he is. Then he lights a</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No. And nobody knows where she is.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: It was probably meant to be like this. Each
of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Listen to this one…The commander says to
the sergeant: ‘You remember that windmill that used to be there?’ ‘Yes,
sir, I remember the mill’s gone but the wind’s still there!’ nervous
laughter. But this time ALFREDO remains cold, unmoved, does not laugh
with him. SALVATORE gradually falls silent. He doesn’t know what to say.
For the first time in his life, he doesn’t know what goal to aim for,
doesn’t know what to do. The cloud of smoke wreaths his nervous face,
now he seems You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Now I understand why the soldier went
away just before the end. That’s right, just one more night and the
princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her
promise. And…that would have been terrible, he would have died from it.
So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the
illusion that she was there waiting for him… the one to explain
something to ALFREDO. And ALFREDO realizes how bitter his story is and,
above all, that the boy standing there is no</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This
land is cursed. against a boat on the beach. ALFREDO goes on When you’re
here every day you feel like you’re at the center of the universe, it
seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two…And
when you come back, everything’s different. The thread has broken. You
don’t find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist.
Isn’t that the case?…You’ve got to go away a long time, for many, many
years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where
you were born…But not now, it’s impossible. Now you’re blinder than I
am. from the heart, and SALVATORE is spellbound.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Who said that? Gary Cooper, James
Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life’s
not like you saw it in the movies. Life…is harder. SALVATORE’S shoulder,
Get out! Go back to Rome. You ’re young, the world is yours! And I’m
old…I don’t want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about
you.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Don’t come back any more, don’t think about
us, don’t turn round, don’t write, don’t give in to nostalgia. Forget us
all. If you can’t hear it and come back, don’t come looking for me, I
won’t let you into the house, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Thanks for all you’ve done for me.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Whatever you do, love it like you loved
that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little… Hands wave
in the air, drawing further and further away. The PRIEST has arrived at
the last moment and waves goodbye</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Goodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too late.
What a shame!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It’s Toto…I knew it…</p>
<p><strong>maria ’s voice</strong>: Toto!…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Lia’ll be so glad to see you, you’ll see. And
you won’t recognize the kids any more, they’re grown up by now.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: They’re always writing to me saying they
want to come to Rome!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: See how pretty the house is? We did
everything over. If it hadn’t been for you! Come, I have a surprise….
and leads him out to the hallway. SALVATORE looks at her and feels a
pang. She seems smaller, age withers the body, she is slightly stooped,
her hair is gathered into a knot at You must be tired. If you want to
rest, there’s time before the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You shouldn’t tell me that now. After all
these years! message, feels guilty. Thinking about it, it seems
incredible that he has never come before. MARIA opens a door, steps
aside to let her son in, I put all your things in here. Go in, go
in…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He would have been happy you came, Toto. He
always talked about you. Always! Right to the end! He was terribly fond
of you… unable to say any more. SALVATORE gives her a hug, deeply
touched by her He left two things for you. Come see me before you
leave.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: How long’s it been shut?</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Six years ago this May. No one came any
more. You “know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television,
videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city’s bought it
now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they’re tearing it down…A
pity!…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But why do you call me ‘Mr. Di Vita’? It
didn’t used to be that way…</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Well, it’s hard to call an important
person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I’11 call
you… Toto!…</p>
<p><strong>spaccafico</strong>: Bless you, Toto.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Uncle, the next time Granny comes to Rome, I
want to come along too. I want to see what you do when you work…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Fine. But I warn you, there isn’t much to
see. I sell much more smoke than fire…</p>
<p><strong>alfio</strong>: Watch out, don’t get too familiar with those
two they’re worse than cannibals. They’ll take advantage.</p>
<p><strong>filippo</strong>: You leaving tomorrow, Uncle?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I don’t know, Filippo. I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It must be for you…They’ve been calling all
afternoon. They wanted to know if you’re leaving this evening or
tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: A double whisky, please.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Excuse me, Miss… indifferent, but
friendly. He looks at her wonderful I’m so sorry, I thought you were
someone else.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What are you thinking, Toto?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I was thinking…that we’ve never talked,
Mamma…When I was little I saw you as if you were already old. That’s
probably true with all kids… Who knows? before him. He strokes her old,
skinny, heavily But only now do I realize you were young, you were
beautiful, had a whole life before you. But how… …how could you have
lived alone all that time, with no one to look after you? You could have
remarried…Why not? At the time I probably wouldn’t have understood, but
I would have later…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I never had anybody. If that’s what you
think…I didn’t want anybody. I always remained faithful. First to your
father, then to you, to Lia. That’s the way I’m made, there’s nothing I
can do about it. And you’re like me, you’re too honest and too attached
to the things you love…But I don’t know if that’s a good thing.
Faithfulness is a bad business. If you’re faithful, you’re always alone!
the profound truth of those words. And he says nothing. The silence is
broken by the ringing of the phone. A menacing sound, which SALVATORE
cannot bear. He knows they are calling him from Rome, gives a nervous
gesture, stands up and pulls out the plug. The silence returns, the
whistling of the wind. MARIA lowers her It’s my fault! It would have
been better if I hadn’t called you…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No…It’s nothing to do with you. It’s just
that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought
I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it’s
quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and
feel as if I didn’t know her, and you, Mamma…I abandoned you, ran away
like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an
explanation…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And I never asked for one! You have nothing
to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was
that. With no beating around the bush… Only one thing made me suffer:
bolting the door shut before going to bed at night…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: You never used to do that!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No, no…When you used to work at the movies, I
could never get to sleep at night until you came home. Then when you
arrived, I pretended to be asleep, but I heard all your movements. Then
when you fell asleep, I’d get up and bolt the door. Then, when you left,
every time I did it, I felt as if I had left somebody outside the door,
far away…. MOTHER’S words, surprised and entranced by the poetry of her
way of But you were right to leave. You succeeded in doing what you
wanted to do… When I call you, a different, woman always answers. I
pretend I know them so they won’t have to go through the embarrassment
of introducing themselves. I’m sure they take me for a crazy old woman.
But so far I’ve never heard one voice that really loves you…I would have
known. And yet, I’d like to see you…settled down…fall in love… But your
life’s there. Here there are nothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Boccia!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo.</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: Hello? SALVATORE shuts his eyes,
is about to speak, but the lump in his throat</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You want something?</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: Hello, who’s speaking?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I’d like to speak to Signora Elena…</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: Speaking. Who is it, please?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Salvatore.</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: Salvatore…who?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Di Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you
remember? heavy. SALVATORE opens his eyes, looks at the window. Her
shadow is motionless, as if cut out of Elena, I’m here, in the bar,
across the street from your house.</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: Certainly, I remember…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Elena. I’d like to see you…Let’s
meet.</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: It’s been so long. Why should we
meet? What good would it do?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Please, don’t say no.. .</p>
<p><strong>voice on telephone</strong>: I’m old, Salvatore. And you too.
It’s best not to meet. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Salvatore!</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: How’d you know I’d be here?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: You’re still beautiful…</p>

you come back?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo died. Do you remember him?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Of course I remember him. I’m sorry. You were
terribly fond of him.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I saw your daughter. She’s beautiful! Who
knows how many Salvatores must be running after her…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: One or two. Bur there’re not all that many
Salvatores. but a puzzled smile as if what she has said had I’ve got a
son, too…he’s older. And you, do you have children?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: No. And I’m not married. silence. A veil
of sadness clouds her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore’s</strong>: Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn’t
what I dreamt of then…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: My husband…you know him.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Sure, sure! Boccia… What’s he do?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Politics. He’s the district representative.
We met at the University in Pisa.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: And…how come you never married that guy
from Tuscany?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I didn’t want to…I had to fight tooth and
nail. But in the end I won… smile. It’s as if the void were growing and
swelling within. Thunder and lightning shatter the roaring of the wind
and sea, hut it does not rain. At that time…I was waiting for you…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But I’ve never forgotten you, Elena!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Nor have I. Even though you disappeared…
feels as if he were plunging into the void. What she has said strikes
him as grotesque. ELENA strokes his hair, as if to restrain his sinking
heart, gives a sweet But what’s the point of talking about it? We risk
being pathetic and ridiculous. You still live in Rome?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: What do you mean, you were waiting for
me?! What are you saying? once, continues, breathing The last time we
saw each other, we made a date to meet at the Cinema Paradiso. You
remember? And you didn’t come, you disappeared without leaving a trace,
nothing! I’ll tell you how many years have gone by: more than
thirty!!!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I kept that date. absurdity of it. A nervous,
heartbroken laugh, which slowly melts away as she goes on to But I was
late… out of her blue eyes, but she tells her story in a I had a fight
with my family. I tried to convince them again that they couldn’t
separate us. But it was futile. They had decided to leave Sicily once
and for all. Which is what we did. I didn’t know what to do any more,
what to say. And I said yes, I’d do whatever they wanted. In return, my
father promised to let me see you one last time, to say goodbye. But I
hoped that by seeing each other we could take advantage of it and make a
decision…I thought we would run away together. Dries her tears with the
back of her hand, and My father drove me to the movie theatre. But you
weren’t in the projection booth. Only Alfredo…</p>
<p><strong>elena’s voice</strong>: And I didn’t have time to wait for
you to comeback…</p>
<p><strong>elena’ s father</strong>: Elena! Hurry up!!</p>
<p><strong>young elena</strong>: All right, Daddy!…</p>
<p><strong>elena’s voice</strong>: So I told Alfredo how things stood
and fiat I was leaving the same evening, and I asked him to tell you
everything. He was very kind, he listened carefully, then…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Easy, easy. Listen carefully to what I have
to say. If you want me to tell Toto what you’ve told me, I will. But if
you want my advice, forget it. It’s better for both of you if you don’t
see each other… of resentment, listens Dear girl, fire always turns into
ashes! Even the deepest love ends sooner or later. And after that other
loves appear, lots of them. Toto, he can’t understand fiat now. If I
tell him he won’t believe it, he’ d be capable of killing me…But you can
understand, you’ve got to understand…Do it for him!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: It’s the first time I’ve had to chance to
tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on
you too!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I told him I’d take his advice. But before I
went away I left you that note… quick look, a questioning I was on my
way down the stairs…</p>
<p><strong>elena’ s voice</strong>: I thought Alfredo couldn’t see me.
So I snuck back up… making any noise. Goes over to the film-winder.
Takes out a pen, looks for a scrap of paper, but doesn’t see any. Her
eyes fall on the film receipts hanging on the nail. She tears off the
top one, turns it over and scribbles a message on the I wrote you where
you could find me, and that I’d wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: But you disappeared all the same.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You’ll
never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I
dreamt of you for years! That’s why I went away…and never came back
here. free, dissolving into quiet, almost childish tears. ELENA is
startled by his reaction. She caresses him, passionately. They embrace
and remain like that, she with her face buried in his shoulder, he
leaning on hers with his tear- Even as the years passed, in all the
women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it’s true, but
there was always something missing… on caressing him gently until he
calms down. The car windows are steamed up. The sea, the harbor, the
waves have disappeared. Nothing remains but the sound of the storm.
SALVATORE takes her face between his hands. They gaze at each other,
their faces practically touching. He I’d never have imagined that all
this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy
lunatic!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: He wasn’t crazy. In the beginning I was
upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood
what he said…and your silence too.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: But I never saw that note! stress the
absurdity of I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it,
that’s the only explanation…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: What difference does it make to find an
explanation? That’s the way it went. But Alfredo didn’t betray you, he
was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen
to be with me, you’d have never made your films. And that would have
been a pity! Because they’re wonderful, I’ve seen them all. joy, then
she smiles, But you shouldn’t have gone and changed your name. You
should have kept your own.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: These are the things he left to you…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When they showed your films on television, he
was happy. He’d plop himself down there and all his ailments were
forgotten. He knew all the words by heart, every one, and I’d describe
what was going on. And when the papers talked about you, I had to read
them two or three times…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Did he ever think of meeting me?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, never! One time your mother said that if
he wanted, you’d have surely come. He got furious and said ‘No, Toto
mustn’t come back to Giancaldo, never!!’ He didn’t say it to be mean. He
was a decent man. Who knows what he could have been thinking? Towards
the end he’d say such strange things. And a moment before he shut his
eyes, he told your mother not to let you know.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore’s voice</strong>: Salvatore, forgive me. I’ll
explain later what happened. Not finding you here was terrible.
Unfortunately, this evening, my mother and I are leaving for Tuscany.
We’re moving there. But you’ re the only one I love, I’ll never be with
anybody else, I promise. Here’s the address of a girlfriend of mine
where you can write to me. Don’t abandon me. Love and kisses, Elena.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: When are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: This afternoon. Elena, in the future
maybe we could…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: No, Salvatore…there is no future. There’s
only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a
beautiful dream. We never did it when we were kids, remember? SALVATORE
nods his head Now that it’s happened, I don’t think there could have
been a better ending. glances one last time at</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: I’ll never agree with you. Never,
Elena.</p>
<p><strong>village idiot</strong>: The square’s mine, the square’s mine,
the square’s mine…</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Please check the splices. As soon as
you’re ready you can start.</p>
<p><strong>projectionist</strong>: OK. Congratulations on your film.
It’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>colleague</strong>: The distributor is opening up the film
earlier. The press conference is in the afternoon. The actors will also
be there, the producer, just about everyone.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: The official notification of the award
just came out, but we’ve already received a mountain of telegrams.
Aren’t you happy?</p>
<p><strong>salvatore</strong>: It’s all right. We’ll talk about it
later.</p>
