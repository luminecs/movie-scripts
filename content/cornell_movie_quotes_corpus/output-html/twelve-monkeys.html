<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
ready for boarding at inmate number 66578, Greely.</p>
<p><strong>prison p.a. system</strong>: –number 5429, Garcia – number
87645, Cole…</p>
<p><strong>first look at his environment…a windowless underground world
of</strong>: ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE…AN ALMOST COLORLESS
“REALITY” OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE “DREAMLIKE” THAN
HIS DREAM.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Ssssst! Jose, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: “Volunteers” again.</p>
<p><strong>scarface</strong>: “Volunteer duty”.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I didn’t volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>scarface</strong>: You causing trouble again?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No trouble.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: James Cole. Cleared from quarantine.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: Thank you. You two wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>scarface</strong>: He’s got a history, Doctor. Violence.</p>
<p><strong>scarface</strong>: Anti-social six – doing 25 to life.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: I don’t think he’s going to hurt us.
You’re not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: Why don’t you sit down,
Mr. Cole.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: We want you to tell us about last
night.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I went to the surface and I collected
specimens like I was told.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I mashed the spider, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: We’ll get to the spider later,
Mr. Cole. Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.</p>
<p><strong>astpophysicist</strong>: Where you collected sample #4, what
street was that?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: It’s important to observe everything.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I think it was…I’m sure it was 2nd Street.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ponytail</strong>: WATCH IT!</p>
<p><strong>terrified traveler</strong>: Just exactly why did you
volunteer?</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Wake up, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh, I didn’t hear the…</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: I asked you, why did you
volunteer?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I
volunteered.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: We appreciate you volunteering. You’re a
very good observer, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You’ll get a reduction in sentence.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: To be determined by the proper
authorities.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You don’t want to jeopardize that
reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: We have a very advanced program,
something very different, requires very skilled people.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: An opportunity to reduce your
sentence considerably…</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: And possibly play an important role in
returning the human race to the surface of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: We want tough minded people. Strong
mentally. We’ve had some…misfortunes with “unstable” types.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: For a man in your position…an
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: Not to volunteer could be a real
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: Definitely a mistake!</p>
<p><strong>poet</strong>: Still among the myriad microwaves, the
infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeroes, we find words,
infinitesimally small, byte-sized now, tinier even than science lurking
in some vague electricity where, if we listen we can hear the solitary
voice of that poet telling us, “We are no other than a moving row Of
Magic shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumined
Lantern hold In Midnight by the Master of the show.”</p>
<p><strong>poet</strong>: “Yesterday This Day’s Madness did prepare;
Tomorrow’s Silence, Triumph or Despair: Drink! for you know not whence
you came, nor why: Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.”</p>
<p><strong>franki</strong>: – so they get there and they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming
about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn’t know
where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. All they got was his name.
They figure he’s stoned out of his mind, it’s some kinda psychotic
episode, so they’re gonna bring him…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: He’s been tested for drugs?</p>
<p><strong>franki</strong>: Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops
like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You have him in restraints.</p>
<p><strong>franki</strong>: Were you listening? We got two officers in
the hospital. Yeah, he’s in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough
stellazine to kill a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: That would explain the bruises, I guess. The
struggle.</p>
<p><strong>franki</strong>: You want to go in? Examine him?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Yes, please. You said he gave a name…</p>
<p><strong>franki</strong>: James Cole. That’s everything we got. None
of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no
warrants. Nothing. You want me to go in with you?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>franki</strong>: I’ll be right here…just in case.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I’m a
psychiatrist. I work for the County – I don’t work for the police. My
only concern is your well being – do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I need to go now.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I’m going to be completely honest. I’m not
going to lie to you. I can’t make the police let you go…but I do want to
help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call
you “James”?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: “James”! Nobody ever calls me that.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Have you been a patient at County? Have I
seen you someplace?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of
here. I’m supposed to be getting information.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What kind of information?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It won’t help you. You can’t do anything about
it. You can’t change anything.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Change what?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I need to go.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Do you know why you’re here, James.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Because I’m a good observer. Because I have a
tough mind.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I see. You don’t remember assaulting a
police officer…several officers?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They wanted identification. I don’t have any
identification. I wasn’t trying to hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You don’t have a driver’s license, James? Or
a Social Security card?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Why not? Most people have some ID.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You’ve been in an institution, haven’t you,
James? A hospital?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: A jail? Prison?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Underground.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Hiding?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I love this air. This is wonderful air.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What’s wonderful about the air, James?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s so clean. No germs.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You’re afraid of germs?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Why do you think there aren’t any germs in
the air, James?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: This is April, right?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: July.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: July?!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Do you know what year it is?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What year is it?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What year do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: 1995?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You think it’s July of 1995? That’s the
future, James. Do you think you’re living in the future?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, 1995 is the past.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: 1995 is the future, James. This is 1989.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: South of France, buddy. Fancy hotel.
You’re gonna love it.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: South of France?! I don’t want to go to the
South of France. I want to make a telephone call.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Zip it, scumbag – you fooled the
shrink with your act, but you don’t fool us.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you got
any creepy crawlies.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I need to make a telephone call.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.
Can’t make no calls ’til the doctor says.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it
easy, relax into things. We all gonna get along fine if you just
relax.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Jeffrey. Yo! Jeffrey. This here is James.
Whyncha show James around? Tell him the TV rules, show him the games an’
stuff, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: How much you gonna pay me? Huh? I’d be
doing your job.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Five thousand dollars, my man. That
enough? I’ll wire it to your account as usual, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay, Billings. Five thousand. That’s
enough. Five thousand dollars. I’ll give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital
Tour.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Kid around, kid around. It makes them feel
good, we’re all pals. We’re prisoners, they’re the guards, but it’s all
in good fun, you see?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Here’s the games. Games vegitize you. If
you play the games, you’re voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What’d they give you? Thorazine? How much?
Learn your drugs – know your doses.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I need to make a telephone call.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: A telephone call? That’s communication with
the outside world! Doctor’s discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could
just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through
telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people,
infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness. In fact, very
few of us here are actually mentally ill. I’m not saying you’re not
mentally ill, for all I know you’re crazy as a loon. But that’s not why
you’re here. Why you’re here is because of the system, because of the
economy. There’s the TV. It’s all right there. Commercials. We are not
productive anymore, they don’t need us to make things anymore, it’s all
automated. What are we for then? We’re consumers. Okay, buy a lot of
stuff, you’re a good citizen. But if you don’t buy a lot of stuff, you
know what? You’re mentally ill! That’s a fact! If you don’t buy
things…toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically
operated sexual devices… SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR
DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-
ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Take it easy, Jeffrey. Be calm.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: So if you want to watch a particular
program, say “All My Children” or something, you go to the Charge Nurse
and tell her what day and time the show you want to see is on. But you
have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on. There was this
one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played. He
couldn’t quite grasp the idea that the Charge Nurse couldn’t just make
it be yesterday for him, turn back time ha ha. What a fruitcake!!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Seriously, more and more people are being
defined now as mentally ill. Why? Because they’re not consuming on their
own. But as patients, they becone consumers of mental health care. And
this gives the so-called sane people work! WHOOO! SHOCK THERAPY! GROUP
THERAPY! HALLUCINATIONS! THERAPEUTIC DRUGS! IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG! PERFECT!
THE SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Okay, that’s it, Jeffrey, you’re gonna get a
shot. I warned you…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Right! Right! Carried away, heh heh. I got
“carried away”. Explaining the workings of…the institution.</p>
<p><strong>tj washington</strong>: I don’t really come from outer
space.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: This is TJ Washington, Jim – he doesn’t
really come from outer space.</p>
<p><strong>tj washington</strong>: Don’t mock me, my friend. It’s a
condition of “mental divergence”. I find myself on another planet, Ogo,
part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes
on Pluto. But even though it’s a totally convincing reality in every
way…I can feel, breathe, hear…nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct
of my psyche. I am mentally divergent in that I am escaping certain
unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I
will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Staff! Whoo! Time for Staff. Now the
geniuses cure you. Hallelujah!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: This is a place for crazy people! I’m not
crazy!</p>
<p><strong>resident #1</strong>: We don’t use that term…“crazy”,
Mr. Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well, you’ve got some real nuts in here!
Listen to me, all of you – I have to tell you something that’s going to
be difficult for you to understand, but…</p>
<p><strong>dr. railly</strong>: James…please. These are all doctors here
and we want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: Mr. Cole – last night you told
Dr. Railly you thought it was… 1995. … How about right now? Do you know
what year it is right now?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: 1989. Look, I’m not confused. There’s been a
mistake, I’ve been sent to the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Hey, I’m not going to hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Do any of you know anything about the Army of
the Twelve Monkeys? They paint this, stencil it, on buildings, all over
the place.</p>
<p><strong>dr. casey</strong>: Mr. Cole…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Right. I guess you wouldn’t, this is 1989,
they’re probably not active yet. That makes sense! Okay. Listen to me,
three billion people died in 1995. Three billion, got that? Almost the
whole population. Of the world! Only about one percent survived.</p>
<p><strong>resident #2</strong>: Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Save you? How can I save you? It already
happened! I can’t save you. I’m simply trying to get some information
for people in the present so that someday… You don’t believe me. You
think I’m crazy. But I’m not crazy. I’m a convict, sure, I have a quick
temper, but I’m as sane as anyone in this room. I…</p>
<p><strong>dr. railly</strong>: Can you tell us the name of the prison
you’ve come from?</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No! Look, I don’t belong here! What I need to
do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who
would straighten everything out?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Scientists. I’m supposed to report in to them.
They’ll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: So you could talk to these scientists
and they do what? Send you to the future?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, no. I can’t talk to them. It’s called,
“voice mail”. I’m supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the
present.</p>
<p><strong>resident #2</strong>: “From the present.” We’re not in the
present now, Mr. Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, no. This is the past. This has already
happened. Listen…</p>
<p><strong>resident #3</strong>: Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 – that’s
the present, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, 1995 is the past, too. Look…</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: These scientists, Mr. Cole? Are they
doctors like ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No! I mean yes, but… Look, I’ve been given a
lot of drugs but I’m still perfectly lucid. You have to let me use the
phone. One call!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes? Whaaaaat? “Voice mail”! I don’t know
what you’re talkin’ about. … Is this a joke? I don’t know any
scientists. James who? Never heard of you!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It wasn’t who you expected?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It was some lady. She didn’t know
anything.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Perhaps it was a wrong number…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No. That’s the reason they chose me – I
remember things.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, where did you grow up? Was it around
here? Around Baltimore?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I have the…strangest feeling I’ve met you
before…a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever…?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Wait! This is only 1989! I’m supposed to be
leaving messages in 1995. It’s not the right number yet. That’s the
problem. Damn! How can I contact them?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, take these. Please – I helped you
like I said I would. Now I want you to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ponytail</strong>: WATCH IT!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: NOOOOOOOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You think you can remove the grill but you
can’t. It’s welded.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: See? I toldja. And all the doors are
locked, too. They’re protecting the people on the outside from us. But
the people outside are as crazy as us.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You know what “crazy” is? “crazy” is
“majority rules”. Take germs for example.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Germs?!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: In the 18th century there was no such
thing! Nobody’d ever imagined such a thing – no sane person anyway.
Along comes this doctor…Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince
people… other doctors mostly…that there are these teeny tiny invisible
“bad things” called germs that get into your body and make you…sick!
He’s trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy…crazy?
Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call ’em?…“germs”!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: “What about the germs?” I say. He goes, “I
don’t believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can
sell you disinfectants and soap!” Now, he’s crazy, right? Hey, you
believe in germs, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Of course not, I never thought you were.
You want to escape, right? That’s very sane. I can help you. You want me
to, don’t you? Get you out?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: If you know how to escape, why don’t you…?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Why don’t I escape, that’s what you were
going to ask me, right? ’Cause I’d be crazy to escape! I’m all taken
care of, see? I’ve sent out word.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’ve managed to contact certain underlings,
evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will
contact my father. When he learns I’m in this kind of place, he’ll have
them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat
you…properly. LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS! TOWELS! LIKE A BIG
HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Sorry. Really sorry. Got a little agitated.
The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly…suddenly I felt
LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW
FRAMES AND…EATING THEM, YES, EATING THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You dumb assholes! I’m a mental patient!
I’m supposed to act out. Wait til you morons find out who I am. My
father’s gonna be really upset. AND WHEN MY FATHER GETS UPSET, THE
GROUND SHAKES! MY FATHER IS GOD! I WORSHIP MY FATHER.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They hurt you!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Not as bad as what they’re doing to
kitty.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Look at those assholes, they’re asking for it!
Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Wiping cut the human race! That’s a great
idea! But it’s more of a long term thing – right now we have to focus on
more immediate goals. I didn’t say a word about “you know what”.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What are you talking about???</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You know – your plan.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What’re you writing? You a reporter?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s private.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: A lawsuit? You going to sue them?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Yo, James – time to take your meds.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Get it? Monk - Key. Monk! Key!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What….???</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major
load! Listen up – try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan!
Remember? I did my part.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What…???</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Not, “what”, babe! When!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: YES – NOW! BUY NOW! STOCKS AND BONDS! NO
MORE MONKEY BUSINESS – BUY NOW.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: YES, YES. ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: BUY! SELL! SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!</p>
<p><strong>heavy woman patient</strong>: I’M GETTING DIZZY. MAKE HIM
STOP!</p>
<p><strong>skinny man patient</strong>: HERE THEY COME! THEY’RE
COMING!</p>
<p><strong>old man patient</strong>: FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS! I GOT FIVE
HUNDRED DOLLARS! I’M INSURED!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: OPPORTUNITY! DEFINITELY! A WINDOW OF
OPPORTUNITY! OPENING NOW! NOW’S THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE
MOMENT! YES! YES! MASTERCARD! VISA! THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: SEIZE THE MOMENT! GET RICH! NOW’S THE TIME!
GO FOR IT!</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the
fool.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: LAST CHANCE! LAST CHANCE! HEY – OW!</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: Place to go would be…Florida. The keys are
lovely this tine of year.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: Be careful. J. Edgar Hoover isn’t really
dead.</p>
<p><strong>dr. casey</strong>: This was in my box, but I have a slight
suspicion it wasn’t meant for me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. casey</strong>: “You are the most beautiful woman I have
ever seen. You live in a beautiful world. But you don’t know it. You
have freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe.”</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Cole. James Cole – right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. casey</strong>: “I would do anything to stay here, but I
must leave. Please, help me.”</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Poor man…</p>
<p><strong>dr. goodins</strong>: Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of
yours, right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. goodins</strong>: He got out. Took off. Last seen, he was
up on nine.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Just relax – don’t fight it. We have to know
exactly what’s there so we can…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Eh, excuse me. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It’s just a shot to calm you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No more drugs. Please…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I have to do this, James. You’re very
confused.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: Don’t be defensive, Kathryn, this
isn’t an inquisition.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I didn’t think I was being defensive. I was
just…</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: He should have been in restraints. It
was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to
it?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the
strangest feeling about him – I’ve seen him somewhere and…</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: Two policemen were already in the
hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security
Officer with a fractured skull.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I said it was bad judgment! What else do you
want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: You see what I mean? You’re being
defensive. Isn’t she being defensive, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Uh, Dr. Fletcher – we got another…
situation.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: He was in full restraints? And the
door was locked?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Yes, sir. Did it myself.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: And he was fully sedated?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: He was fully sedated!</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: Then are you trying to tell me that a
fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent,
replaced the grill behind him and that he’s wriggling through the
ventilation system right now?</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: Flight 784 to San Francisco now

more. The Police are after me.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh, what?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: He’s drugged out of his mind! He’s
completely zoned out.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Cole, did you or did you not record
that message?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh, that message…me?</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: It’s a digital reconstruction of a
message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make
that call?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I couldn’t call! You sent me to the wrong
year! It was 1989.</p>
<p><strong>scientists</strong>: 1989!</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: You’re certain of that?</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: What did you do with your time, Cole? Did
you waste it on drugs? Women?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They forced me to take drugs.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: Forced you! Why would someone force you to
take drugs?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I got into trouble. I got arrested. But I
still got you a specimen – a spider – but I didn’t have anyplace to put
it, so I ate it. It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn’t
matter.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: What about it, Cole?</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: Did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh, no, sir. I…</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: What about these people? Did you see
any of these people?</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Him? You saw that man?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.</p>
<p><strong>micro3iologist</strong>: You were in a mental
institution?!</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: You were sent to make very important
observations!</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: You could have made a real
contribution.</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: Helped to reclaim the planet…</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: As well as reducing your sentence.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: The question is, Cole – “Do you want
another chance?”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: My name’s not “Bob”.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What do you mean, “maybe”? What’s that
supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: 1989.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It was supposed to be 1995.</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: No mistakes this time, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Stay alert. Keep your eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: Good thinking about that spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: Just relax now – don’t fight it. We
have to know exactly what’s there so we can fix it.</p>

<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t understand. Where am I?</p>

<p><strong>dr. kathryn railly</strong>: MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS
MAY 17</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: I think, Dr. Railly, you have given your
alarmists a bad name. Surely there is very real and very convincing data
that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race:
proliferation of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding habits, the rape
of the environment, the pollution of land, sea, and air. In this
context, isn’t it obvious that “Chicken Little” represents the sane
vision and that Homo Sapiens’ motto, “Let’s go shopping!” is the cry of
the true lunatic?</p>
<p><strong>disheveled professor</strong>: Doctor Railly – please! I
wonder if you’re aware of my own studies which indicate that certain
cycles of the moon actually impact on the incidence of apocalyptic
predictions as observed in urban emergency rooms and…</p>
<p><strong>marilou</strong>: You were great.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>marilou</strong>: The reservation’s at nine thirty – it’s
getting late.</p>
<p><strong>disheveled professor</strong>: Doctor Railly – please – this
is very important!</p>
<p><strong>wayne chang</strong>: You sure you’re gonna be all right?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I’ll be there in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>disheveled professor</strong>: Dr. Railly, I simply cannot
understand your exclusion of the moon in relation to apocalyptic
dementia…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Get in!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I’ve got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You can have my purse. I have a lot of cash
and credit…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Here! You can have the keys. You can…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: START THE CAR! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Where… where are we going’</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: But that’s… that’s more than 200 miles!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That’s why I can’t walk there. Turn here… I
think…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: If you make me go with you, it’s kidnapping.
That’s a serious crime. If you let me go, you could just take the car
and…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I don’t know how to drive! We went underground
when I was nine, I told you that. When you come to the corner, turn
right.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked
room six years ago.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: 1989. Six years for you. There’s the sign!
Right here!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I can’t believe this is a coincidence,
Mr. Cole. Have you been…following me?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You told me you’d help me. I know this isn’t
what you meant, but…I was desperate… no money…bum leg… sleeping on the
streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your
book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to
Philadelphia?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s the next step. I checked out the
Baltimore information, it was nothing. It’s Philadelphia, that’s where
they are, the ones who killed everyone. Zs that a radio? Does it play
music?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ve never seen the ocean!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It’s an advertisement, Mr. Cole. You do
understand that, don’t you? It’s not really a special message to
you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You used to call me “James”.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You’d prefer that? … James…you don’t really
have a gun, do you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Everybody’s got a gun. In this city…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Can you…can you make it louder? I love hearing
twentieth century music! Hearing music and breathing air!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: “Never cry wolf!”</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: My father told me that. “Never cry wolf.” Then
people won’t believe you if…something really happens.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: “If something really happens”…like what,
James?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Something bad. Is that all the music? I don’t
want to hear this stuff…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Did something terrible happen to you when
you were a child? Something so bad…?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Dr. Railly – this is Palmer from
Psych Admitting. There was a guy here this afternoon looking for you. He
seemed very agitated. We tried to keep him, but he refused ’n I kept
thinking, I know this guy. Then, just a few minutes ago, it came to me.
It’s Cole! James Cole. Remember him? The paranoid who pulled the Houdini
back in ’89. Well, he’s back and he’s…cuckoo…and he’s looking for you. I
thought you oughta know.</p>
<p><strong>marilou martin</strong>: It’s just as I told you – my husband
and I had gone ahead – she never showed. That’s totally unlike her!</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: Do you happen to know the make of her
car?</p>
<p><strong>marilou martin</strong>: Um…Acura…’92 Acura. … Also, that
cat’s starving! She would never neglect her cat!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You were in my dream just now. Your hair was
different, but I’m sure it was you.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: We dream about what’s important in our
lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the
dream about?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: About an airport…before everything happened.
It’s the same dream I always have – the only one. I’m a little kid in
it.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: And I was in it? What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You were very upset. You’re always very upset
in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It wasn’t me before, James. It’s become me
now because of…what’s happening. Please untie me.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, I think it was always you. It’s very
strange.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You’re flushed. And you were moaning. I
think you’re running a fever. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: No! Don’t leave me here like this!</p>
<p><strong>tv anchorman</strong>: And in Fresno, California…crews
continue to attempt to rescue nine year old Ricky Neuman.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: My notes. Observations. Clues.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Clues? What kind of clues?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.
I’ve told you about them. They spread the virus. That’s why we have to
get to Philadelphia. I have to find them – it’s my assignment.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What will you do…when you find this…secret
army?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I just have to locate the virus in its
original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study
it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the
surface of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You won’t think I’m crazy next month. People
are going to start dying. At first the papers will say it’s some weird
fever, some virus. Then they’ll begin to catch on. They’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I thought it was about us. I thought maybe
they’d found us and arrested me or something.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Just a joke.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about
that little boy in the well?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: When I was a kid I identified with that kid,
down there alone in that pipe…a hundred feet down – doesn’t know if
they’re going to save him.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What do you mean – when you were a kid?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Nevermind. It’s not real – it’s a hoax. A
prank. He’s hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left!</p>
<p><strong>evangelist</strong>: “And the wild beasts of the islands
shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant
palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be
prolonged.”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where I come from we think of this as Eden. If
we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown food. Eden! Look at them! They
donut know what they have. They don’t see the sky. They don’t feel the
air!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The Twelve Monkeys!!! They’re here. Somewhere.
Come on!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Look, I’m warning you. You do anything, I’m
going to go crazy – hurt people!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I’m not going to “do” anything, I promise.
But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: No, sir, Old Bob – don’t even try. They hear
everything. They got that tracking device on you. They can find you
anywhere. Anytime. Ha Ha!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: In the tooth, Bob! Right? But I fooled ’em,
old buddy!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They’re keeping an eye on me.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Who’s keeping an eye on you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The man…with the voice. I recognized him. He’s
from the present. He…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, no – we shouldn’t be here!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James! We have to go back. Those men…</p>
<p><strong>first thug</strong>: Hey, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>second thug</strong>: Stick around, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Please! Please don’t hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Is he…alive?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Come an. We’re running out of time. You can’t
help him.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I did him a favor. Now come on.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You didn’t have a gun before, did you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ve got one now.</p>
<p><strong>evangelist</strong>: You! You! You’re one of us, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Uh, can we help you?</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Excuse me. You looking for something in
particular?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It’s all right, James – it’s just a
tape.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I, uh, I’m looking for the, ah, the Army of
the Twelve Monkeys.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: We don’t know anything about any “Army of the
Twelve Monkeys”, so why don’t you and your friend disappear, okay?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I just need some information…</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Didn’t you hear me? We’re not…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, no – don’t hurt them. Please, I’m a
psychiatrist – just do whatever he tells you to do. He’s… upset –
disturbed. Please – he’s dangerous – just cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: What do you want – money? We only have a few
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I told you what I want. Lock the door!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, why don’t we…?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Lock it now!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us
into something like this.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Mason???</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Jeffrey Mason?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Then, Jeffrey becomes like this…big star – the
media latch on to him because he’s picketing his own father, a “famous
Nobel Prize winning virologist”. You musta seen all that on TV.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, I don’t watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Is this him – Dr. Mason?</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What are you going to do with us?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Tell me more about Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we
do…picketing, leafleting, letter-writing stuff. He said we were,
“ineffectual liberal jerkoffs”. He wanted to do guerrilla “actions” to
“educate” the public.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Yeah, that’s when he let a hundred snakes
loose in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: But we weren’t into that kind of stuff. It’s
counter productive, we told him.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: So he and eleven others split off and became
this underground…“army”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They started planning a “Human Hunt”.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: They bought stun guns and nets and bear
traps. They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and
bankers…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But they didn’t do it. They didn’t do any of
it.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot sold his
friends out!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: He goes on TV, gives a news conference, tells
the whole world he just realized his daddy’s experiments are vital for
humanity and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary and that
he, Jeffrey Mason, from now on, is going to personally supervise the
labs to make sure all the little animals aren’t going to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: If those young men don’t get loose, they
could die in that basement.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: All I see are dead people. Everywhere. What’s
three more?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You know Dr. Mason’s son, Jeffrey Mason,
don’t you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The guy was a total fruitcake.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: And he told you then his father was a famous
virologist.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No – he said his father was “God”!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: This can’t go on, James. You’re not well.
You’re burning with fever.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: We need gas.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I thought you didn’t know how to drive.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I said I was too young to drive. I didn’t say
I was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What’s the matter with your leg?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I got shot. Look – there’s a gas station up
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Shot! Who shot you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It was some kind of…war. Never mind, you
wouldn’t believe me. Turn off here.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You were going to run out off gas on purpose,
weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: No. I want you to turn yourself in, James –
It’ll go much better for you if you do – but I’m not going to trick
you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That has your name on it. Give him cash.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You can come with me. I have to get some
things. Scissors, bandages, some alcohol or whiskey. … I have to look at
your leg, James. I’m a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You shouldn’t put your weight on it. You
need stitches and antibiotics. Lucky for you it was near the
surface.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I love seeing the sun.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Wait – let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You smell so good.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You have to give yourself up, you know.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I have to do something now. Something I don’t
want to do. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I have a mission. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>first agent</strong>: They find him?</p>
<p><strong>second agent</strong>: Who??</p>
<p><strong>first agent</strong>: That kid. The one in the pipe.</p>
<p><strong>second agent</strong>: You believe this? They’re dropping a
monkey down there with a miniature infra-red camera strapped on him and
a roast beef sandwich wrapped in tinfoil.</p>
<p><strong>first agent</strong>: You’re making that up!</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: Would that I could enjoy this opulent
dinner and this excellent and stimulating company for itself, with no
sense of purpose. But alas, I am “burdened” with the sense that with all
this excess of public attention and this cacophony of praise, there
comes great responsibility. Indeed, I practically feel a soapbox growing
under my feet whenever I stand for more than a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What are you talking about? What friend?
I’m not expecting anyone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: Current genetic engineering as well as my
own work with viruses has presented us with powers as terrifying as
any…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: This is ridiculous. My father is making a
major address.</p>
<p><strong>agent #3</strong>: Normally if we caught a guy sneaking
around like this with no I.D., we’d bust his ass, excuse the French, but
this one said he knows you… – and, since you seem to have had
some…uh…unusual…uh…“associates”, we certainly didn’t want to arrest one
of your, uh, closest…pals.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Never saw him before in my life. Go ahead
and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You do know me. You helped me once.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That would be totally out of character.
Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn’t know
me. Now, I’m going to go back and listen to my father’s very eloquent
discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO
DEATH.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m here about some monkeys.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Excuse me – what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Monkeys. Twelve of them.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Arnold…Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: My God, Arnie, what’s happened to you? You
look like shit</p>
<p><strong>agent #3</strong>: You know this man?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Of course I know him. What do you think – I
act like this to strangers? Listen – you fellas are terrific. I thought
you were pulling a number on me. What a terrible thing if you’d thrown
old Arnie out. I owe you guys the big apologia! Mea culpa, fellas.
Christ, Arnie, it’s black tie! I mean, I said, “drop by,” but, like,
this is Dad’s big “do”…vips, senators, secret service, and…and
everything.</p>
<p><strong>agent #4</strong>: “Arnie?”</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Arnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone. Used
to be my best friend. Still is. What’ve you lost, Arnie – forty pounds?
No wonder I didn’t know you. You hungry? Lots of dead cow, dead lamb,
dead pig. Real killer feast we’re putting on tonight.</p>
<p><strong>agent #4</strong>: These people – all of ’em – are true
weirdoes!</p>
<p><strong>agent #3</strong>: I’m gonna call in a description of this
“Pettibone” character. You go keep an eye on him. Make sure he doesn’t
do one of the guests with a fork.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hey, nice ta see ya. Lookin’ good! Hi,
there. Yes, it has been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: County Hospital, right? 1989. The
“Immaculate Escape” – am I right? Why, thank you – you look wonderful,
too.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Listen to me – I can’t do anything about what
you’re going to do. I can’t change anything. I can’t stop you. I just
want some information…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs. I am a
new person! I’m completely adjusted. Witness the tux. It’s Armani. Who
chattered? Goines? Weller?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I just need to have access to the pure virus,
that’s all! For the future!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Come on, follow me. You don’t lock so
good.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t have time to go upstairs. The police
are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it
is.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I get it! This is your old plan, right?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Plan? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching
TV, and you were all upset about the…desecration of the planet. And you
said to me, “Wouldn’t it be great if there was a germ or a virus that
could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they
are?” You do remember that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Bulishit! You’re fucking with my head!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: And that’s when I told you my father was
this famous virologist and you said, “Hey, he could make a germ and we
could steal it!”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates We
live underground! The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats. We’re
like moles or worms. All we want to do is study the original…</p>
<p><strong>agent #4’s voice</strong>: Okay – take it easy. We know who
you are, Mr. Cole.</p>
<p><strong>agent #4</strong>: Let’s go somewhere and talk this thing
over. Okay? Just come with me…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You’re right! Absolutely right. Me’s a nut
case, totally deranged. Delusional! Paranoid. HIS PROCESSOR’S ALL FUCKED
UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE “ARMY OF THE
TWELVE MONKEYS”? IT’S A COLLECTION OF NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE
DOWNTOWN. SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO
DO WITH THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A
BUNCH OF INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR GRAND PLOT!</p>
<p><strong>agent #3</strong>: Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we’ve got him.
Everything’s…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT THE
DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU’VE
“PROCESSED” THAT INFORMATION THROUGH YOUR ADDLED PARANOID
INFRA-STRUCTURE AND LO AND BEHOLD, I’M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE “ARMY OF THE
TWELVE MONKEYS” BECOMES SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY CABAL. THIS
MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???</p>
<p><strong>agent #4</strong>: Did a man just come through
here…limping?</p>
<p><strong>come on out, mr cole – we’re not going</strong>: TO HURT
YOU.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: LIGHTS! LIGHTS!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: There! He’s showing lights.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Goddamnit! Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: There! Over there.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Where? CO-PILOT Eight o’clock! He was right
there.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: He musta turned his lights of if.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Couldn’t drive down there without lights.
We just can’t see ’em.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Maybe he’s not driving!</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: He’s not in here.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You bastard! You total bastard!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I could have died in there. If something had
happened to you I would have died.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I…I…I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What have you done? Did you…kill
someone?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No! I…don’t think so. I stole a car and they
chased me. I hit a tree.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: See – you can drive after all!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Yeah, sort of, I guess. I…I’m sorry I locked
you up. I thought…I thought… I think maybe I am crazy!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What made you think that?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the
virus. And suddenly, I wasn’t sure. We talked when I was in the
institution, and it was all…fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe
I’m the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.
Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You’ve created something in your
mind, James – a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you
don’t want to face.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m…“mentally divergent”. I would love to
believe that.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It can be dealt with, but only if you want
to. I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I need help all right. They’re coming after
me.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: First, it’s important that you surrender to
them instead of them catching you running. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It would be great if I’m crazy. If I’m wrong
about everything…the world will be okay. I’ll never have to live
underground.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The gun! … I lost it</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No gun! Stars! Air! I can live here.
Breathe!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I’m going to attract their attention, let
them know where we are, okay?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: They’ll tell you to put your hands on top of
your head. Do what they tell you. You’re going to get better, James – I
know it!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I love this world!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Remember, I’m going to help you. I’ll stay
with you. I won’t let them…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Then I said something to him about
cooperating and he said he would do that, so I got in the car and
started honking the horn. When I got out, he was gone.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant halperin</strong>: You lucked out. For a while we
thought you were a body they found down state… mutilated.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: He wouldn’t do something like that – he…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant ralperin</strong>: This the man he attacked?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I’d like to be clear about this. That man
and the other one were…“severely” beating us. James Cole didn’t start
it. In fact – he saved me!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant ralperin</strong>: Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you
can explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist – why do kidnap victims
almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed ’em and try to
make us understand how kind these bastards really were?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It’s a normal reaction to a life-
threatening situation. He’s sick. He thinks he comes from the future.
He’s been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world
is starting to disintegrate. He needs help!</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist’s voice</strong>: Wake up! Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>geologist’s voice</strong>: I think we gave him too much.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist’s voice</strong>: WAKE UP, PRISONER!</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Come on, Cole, cooperate!</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: Spit it out… you went to the home of a
famous virologist…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You…don’t…exist! You’re in my mind…</p>
<p><strong>scientists</strong>: What? What’s that? What did he say? His
brain’s fried. Give him another shot! SPEAK UP, COLE. WHAT DID YOU DO
NEXT?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: No – I’m in a state of hyper- alertness. I
can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>marilou</strong>: Did you take the sedative?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I hate those things. They mess my head
up.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: He’s dead, isn’t he – that little boy?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: He’s fine. It was just a “prank” he and his
friends pulled.</p>
<p><strong>scientists</strong>: —found my thrills on Blueberry Hill…</p>
<p><strong>scientists</strong>: Well done, James! Well done! Nice going!
Congratulations! Good for you!</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: During your “interview,” while you
were…“under the influence,” you told us you liked music!</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: This isn’t the prison, James.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: This is a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: But just until you recover your,
uh,… equilibrium.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You’re still a little… disoriented.</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: Stress! Time travel!</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: You stood up very well,
considering…</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: Superior work! Superior!</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: You connected the Army of the 12 Monkeys
to a world famous virologist and his son…</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: Others will take over now…</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: We’ll be back on the surface in a matter
of months….</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: We’ll retake the planet.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: We’re very close! Because of
you!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: This is it, James…what you’ve been working
for.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: A full pardon!</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: You’ll be out of here in no
time.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Women will want to get to know
you…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I DON’T WANT YOUR “WOMEN,” YOU BRAINLESS TWIT!
I WANT TO BE WELL!</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: Of course you want to be well,
James. And you will be…soon.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: YOU DON’T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS! YOU’RE NOT
REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON’T TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN’T HERE. MADE YOU
UP! YOU CAN’T TRICK ME! YOU’RE IN MY MIND! I’M INSANE AND YOU’RE MY
INSANITY!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: He not only used the word “prank” – he said
the boy was hiding in a barn.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: He kidnapped you, Kathryn. You saw him
murder someone. You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you,
too. You were under tremendous emotional stress.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: For God sakes, Owen, listen to me – he knew
about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to
die!</p>
<p><strong>dr. fletcher</strong>: Kathryn, you know he can’t possibly
know that. You’re a rational person. You’re a trained psychiatrist. You
know the difference between what’s real and what’s not.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: And what we believe is what’s accepted as
“truth” now, isn’t it, Owen? Psychiatry – it’s the latest religion. And
we’re the priests – we decide what’s right and what’s wrong –we decide
who’s crazy and who isn’t. … I’m in trouble, Owen. I’m losing my
faith.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I saw you! In 1995! In the real world! You
were a bum! You pulled out your teeth.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: FUCK YOU!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Oh, yeah? What do I want?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Tell me. Tell me what I want.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: More…than…anything.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant halperin</strong>: Dr. Railly? Jim Halperin,
Philly P.D.. Sorry to call so early but…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You found him? Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant halperin</strong>: Au contraire, Doctor. No sign
of your good friend, the kidnapper. However, the plot thickens. I have a
ballistic report on my desk that says the bullet you claim you removed
from Mr. Cole’s thigh is an antique…and all indications are it was
fired…sometime prior to 1920.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant ralperin</strong>: So what I was thinking was,
maybe if I sent a detective down there to talk with you, you could maybe
revise or amplify on the circumstances…. Hello? Hello? Dr. Railly?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: The food, the sky, the certain, uh,
sexual temptations – you haven’t become “addicted” have you, Cole? To
that “dying” world’</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, sir! I just want to do my part. To get us
back on top…in charge of the planet. And I have the experience, I know
who the people are…</p>
<p><strong>biologist</strong>: He really is the most qualified…</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: But all that…“behavior”…</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: You said we weren’t “real,”
Cole…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well, sir, I don’t think the human mind was
built to exist in two different… whatever you call it…“dimensions.” It’s
stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused. You don’t know
what’s real and what’s not.</p>
<p><strong>microbiologist</strong>: But you know what’s real now?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>geologist</strong>: He’d have to bone up, catch up to our
research, the latest clues…</p>
<p><strong>zoologist</strong>: He’s proved to be a quick study…</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: You can’t trick us, you know. It
wouldn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>biologist</strong>: And why would you want to? It’ll be
dangerously close to the end.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I understand. There’d be no point.</p>
<p><strong>astrophysicist</strong>: We’re going to think about it, Cole.
Among ourselves. We’ll get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: You have reason to believe that my son
may be planning to do what?!!!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Please, I know it sounds insane but…</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: I’m afraid this doesn’t seem very
professional to me, in fact it’s distressingly unprofessional for some-
one who treated my son briefly to take a sudden unsolicited interest in
his mental health six years later, and to telephone a parent to express
opinions that would be inappropriate… I don’t know anything about
“Monkey armies”, Doctor. Nothing whatsoever. If my son ever was involved
in… It would be doubly inappropriate to discuss matters of security with
you, Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at ease, neither my son nor any
other unauthorized person has access to any potentially dangerous
organisms in this laboratory. Thank you for your concern.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by
that man who broke into my house. She seems to have been suddenly struck
by the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: Given the nature of our work, we can’t
ever be careful enough. I think we should review our security
procedures, perhaps upgrade them.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: Let’s consider again our current
information – if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on
June 28, 1995, that makes us know that…?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It was released in Philadelphia, probably on
June 14, 1995.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: And it appeared sequentially after that
in…?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro,
Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: Meaning…???</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to
San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa,
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: And your only goal is…???</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: To find out where the virus is so a qualified
scientist can travel back into the past and study the original
virus.</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: So that…???</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that
will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: IS ANYBODY IN THERE? HELLO? IS SOMEONE IN
THERE? IF YOU’RE IN THERE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: It’s the kidnap woman – the one who was with
the guy who tied us up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: She’s drawing attention to us, that’s what
she’s doing. … I don’t know what you’re up to this time, Mason, but
you’re gonna get us in deep shit!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Whine, whine, whine. What about walkie
talkies? We used to have walkie talkies.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I SAW YOU! I SAW SOMEONE MOVING. I KNOW
YOU’RE IN THERE!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: That’s what they do – secret weird stuff!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You! I know you!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Not just on them. Do ’em on people, too –
down at the shelters. Feed ’em chemicals ’n take pictures of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Have you seen James Cole? The man…?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: They’re watchin’ you. Takin’ pictures.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: The police. I know. Listen, I need to talk
to James, but he has to be careful how he contacts me. He mustn’t get
caught. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Uh, yeah, sure. Uh…who’s James?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: He was with me, he spoke to you. Several
weeks ago. He said you were from the future…watching him.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You get the bolt cutters?</p>
<p><strong>kweskin</strong>: One dozen. They’re in the van.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: One dozen bolt cutters! Whadda you gonna do
with one dozen bolt cutters?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You really want to know?</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: No! Absolutely not. Don’t tell me
anything.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey! Do you know what she’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: WHY DON’T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST
AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND. THIS IS IMPORTANT.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Your psychiatrist? Did you just say, “your
psychiatrist”?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about
flashlights? How many flashlights…?</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: That woman is…was…your… psychiatrist? And now
she’s spray- painting our building?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Kathryn!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James! That’s a policeman. Pretend you don’t
know me. If he sees you…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he?
Don’t worry – it’s all okay now. I’m not crazy any more! I mean, I am
crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to
help me. I want to get well…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James – put your hands down and listen to
me. Things have changed!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, come on! We have to get out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>attention!!! police are watching!</strong>: IS THERE A VIRUS?
IS THIS THE SOURCE? THREE BILLION DIE?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ve seen that…before.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, trust me. We’re in terrible trouble.
We have to run.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some
other guy I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Hey, no problem, it’s probably just another
kidnapping featuring Jeffrey’s shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.
This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former
psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible
schemes, and now who knows what she’s painted out there on our wall?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON
WALLS? You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?
Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous
“pretend-friend-to- animals”?! I’ll tell you why: because when I had
anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing – I
hadn’t even thought of it yet!</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: Then how come she knows what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Here’s my theory on that. While I was
institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of
mental health. I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied thoroughly. Then,
everything about me was entered into a computer where they created a
model of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Now I have to get going – do my part. You
guys check all this stuff out and load up the van. Make sure you have
everything. I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>fale</strong>: He’s seriously crazy – you know that.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James! Come on.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t understand what we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: We’re avoiding the police until I can….talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those
words on the wall – I’ve seen them before… I…I…dreamed them.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Twenty five bucks an hour.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: An hour?!</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: You want quarter hours, go someplace
else.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Here’s ninety eight. For the night.
Deal?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Forty four. Fourth floor, turn right.
Elevator’s busted.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Tommy? This is Charlie at the Globe. You
know if Wallace has a new girl? Sort of a rookie type? Blonde?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Okay…you were standing there looking at the
moon…you were eating grass… then what?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I thought I was in…prison again.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Just like that? You were in prison?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, not really. It’s…it’s in my mind. Like you
said.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You disappeared! One minute you were there,
the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t know – I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: The boy in the well. How did you know that
was just a hoax?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It was? I didn’t…know.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, you said he was hiding in the
barn…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a
kid. Where a boy…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: IT WASN’T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV show and
copied it. Listen, you were right, it’s all in my head. I’m mentally
ill, I imagine all that stuff. I know they’re not real, I can trick
them, make them do what I want. I just worked on them in my head and I
got back here. I can get better. I can stay here.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What does this mean to you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …I had a dream about…something like that.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You had a bullet from World War One in your
leg, James! How did it get there?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You said I had delusions – that I created a
world – you said you could explain everything…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Well, I can’t. … I mean…I’m trying to. I
can’t believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we
can’t change what’s going to happen, that I’m one of the three billion
people who are going to die…soon.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I want to be here. In this time. With you. I
want to become…become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I
want the future to be unknown.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James…do you remember…six years ago…you had
a phone number! You tried to call and…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: This is my territory, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Is this real – or is this one of my
delusions?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: This is definitely real: Excuse me, I think
we have a little misunderstanding here…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: What’re you – some kind of tough guy? You
wanna be a hero? You gonna try and mess with me? Come on…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Now that’s a smart boy. But you, honey, you
think you can go ‘round me and peddle your fancy ass in this part of
town, you bet your life we got what I would call a major goddamn
misunderstandin’.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: JAMES – DON’T!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: You…heard…her. Don’t do it, man.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Put him in the closet, … But get his money
first.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You want me to rob him?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I…I…We need cash, James.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: You two are crazy. I got friends. You put
me in a closet, they’re gonna be really pissed.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, no!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: I have friends, man – if you cut me…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: What…the…fuck..are you doing???</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Oh, my God, James. Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Just…just in case. In case I’m not crazy…
That’s how they find us. By our teeth. I don’t want them to find me.
Ever. I don’t want to go back.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Push it tight!</p>
<p><strong>no problem! i’ll just stay in here!</strong>: DON’T WORRY
ABOUT ME.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes cop</strong>: POLICE! THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND
COME OUTTA THERE!</p>
<p><strong>hey! zat the police! i’m an innocent</strong>: VICTIM IN
HERE! I WAS ATTACKED BY A COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Wait here. I’m going to try that phone
number. Let’s hope it’s nothing!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James! James! It’s okay. We’re insane! We’re
crazy!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It’s a Carpet Cleaning Company…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: A Carpet Cleaning Company?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: No superiors! No scientists. No people from
the future. It’s just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail –
you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You… you left them a message?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I couldn’t resist. I was so relieved.
Wait’ll they hear this nutty woman telling them…they better watch out
for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: “The Army of the Twelve Monkeys – they’re the
ones who are going to do it. I can’t do anything more. The police are
watching me.”</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You… you couldn’t have heard me.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They got your message, Kathryn. They played it
for me. It was a bad recording…distorted. I didn’t recognize your
voice.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: And this. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I guess that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Shall I put this on your account, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: No – I’ll pay cash.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What floor are the wigs on, please?</p>
<p><strong>kweskin</strong>: So then he goes into this incredible riff
about how his shrink, like, replicated his brain while he was in the nut
house. Turned it into a computer.</p>
<p><strong>weller</strong>: And Fale believed it?</p>
<p><strong>kweskin</strong>: Oh, you know Fale! He’s like, “If you guys
get nailed – and I’m sure you will – I never saw you before in nay
life!”</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Let’s do it!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay, that’s Stage One. In Stage Two,
Monkey Four is over here…</p>
<p><strong>goines</strong>: What’s the harm in opening the bag? His eyes
are taped.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah, it’s cruel leaving him like that.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.</p>
<p><strong>ichioka</strong>: So why should we be like him?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Want the full effect?</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: Jeffrey? I know it’s you, Jeffrey. I
recognize your voice.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: JEFFREY??? … Very well. You’re out of
your mind, Jeffrey. I know all about your insane plan. That woman – your
psychiatrist – she told me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: I didn’t believe her – it seemed too
crazy even for you. But, just in case, I took steps to make sure you
couldn’t do it. I took myself out of the loop! I don’t have the code any
more. I don’t have access to the virus. So, go ahead – torture me, but
you can’t extract anything of use to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What…virus?</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you
were going to try this.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What virus are we talking about, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: You’re insane, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You “develop” viruses and you’re calling me
insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don’t tell me, you sick
fuck, it doesn’t matter. Have I ever “developed” a virus? Do I put
helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical
stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and
examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I’m crazy!</p>
<p><strong>dr. mason</strong>: Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are
you going to do? I don’t have to tell you I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT! YOU’RE OUR
HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT? NOW – WHAT FUCKING VIRUS
HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?</p>
<p><strong>“birth of christ”, “discovery of america”, “magna carta
signed”,</strong>: “1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS”, and “1930 TREE CUT
DOWN”.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Here, let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I think I’ve seen this movie before. When I
was a kid. It was on TV.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Shh – don’t talk. Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I have seen it, but I don’t remember this
part. Funny, it’s like what’s happening to us, like the past. The movie
never changes – it can’t change – but everytime you see it, it seems to
be different because you’re different – you notice different things.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: If we can’t change anything…because it’s
already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Flowers! What flowers?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It’s an expression. Here…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Why are we doing this?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: So we can stick our heads out the window and
feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have
while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: But maybe I’m wrong. Maybe you’re wrong. Maybe
we’re both crazy.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: In a few weeks, it will have started or it
won’t. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed
robberies and boring TV shows – we’ll be so happy, we’ll be glad to turn
ourselves in to the police.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy moviegoer</strong>: SHHHHHHH</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where can we hide for a few weeks?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: You said you’d never seen the ocean…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Kathryn?!</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: We’re booked on a 9:30 flight to Key
West.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You were in my dream just now. I didn’t
recognize you.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Well, you look pretty different, too.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I mean in my dream – I didn’t realize it was
you. Then…I woke up and I…I thought you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I remember you…like this. I feel I’ve known
you before. I feel I’ve always known you.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Nine thirty</p>
<p><strong>woman cabbie</strong>: Might be tight.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Tight? My watch says 7:30.</p>
<p><strong>woman cabbie</strong>: On your normal mornin’, okay, plenty a
time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys
factor.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: What? What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>woman cabbie</strong>: Twelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks
didn’t turn on your radio this morning.</p>
<p><strong>woman cabbie</strong>: Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals
outta the zoo last night. Then they locked up this big shot scientist in
one of the cages. Scientist’s own kid was one a the ones did it!</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: That’s what they were up to! Freeing
animals!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: On the walls – they meant the animals when
they said, “We did it.”</p>
<p><strong>woman cabbie</strong>: You can hear it on the radio all the
stations…</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Maybe it’s going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Tell your people if they spot either one
of them, not to try and apprehend then. They should notify us and…</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: – Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready
for boarding at Gate Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I know this place! … This is my dream.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Airports all look the same. Maybe it’s…
James! Your moustache! It’s slipping.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s not just my dream. I was actually here! I
remember now. My parents brought me to meet my uncle. About a week or
two before…before…before everybody started dying.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: They may be looking for us, James. Use this.
You can fix it in the Men’s Room.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I was here…as a kid. I think you were here,
too. But you…looked just like you look now.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James, if we’re identified, they’re going to
send us someplace…but not to Key West!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Right! You’re right. I have to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: I’ll get the tickets and meet you… in the
Gift Shop.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Judy Simmons. I have reservations for Key
West.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Listen, I don’t know whether you’re there or
not. Maybe you just clean carpets. If you do, you’re lucky – you’re
gonna live a long, happy life. But if you other guys exist and you’re
picking this up – forget about the Army of The Twelve Monkeys – they
didn’t do it. It was a mistake’ Someone else did it. The Army of The
Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids playing revolutionaries. It was
someone else!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ve done my job. I did what you wanted. Good
luck. I’m not coming back!</p>
<p><strong>ticket agent</strong>: Don’t see a lot of this… cash.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: It’s…a long story.</p>
<p><strong>ticket agent</strong>: They’ll begin boarding in about twenty
minutes. Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Leave me alone! I made a report. I didn’t have
to do that.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: This is the present. This is not the past.
This is not the future. This is right now!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m staying here! You got that? You can’t stop
me!</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: Anything you say, chief. It’s none of my
business.</p>
<p><strong>ticket agent</strong>: Woooo-eeee. San Francisco, New
Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking!
That’s some trip you’re taking, sir, All in one week!</p>
<p><strong>ticket agent</strong>: Have a good one, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Jo…Jose????</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!
Here, take this.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What? What for? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: Me? Are you kiddin? You’re the one! You were a
hero, man. They gave you a pardon! And whadda you do? You come back and
fuck with your teeth! Wow!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: The phone call, man. The phone call.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The call I just made? Five minutes ago?</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes,
that phone call. I been in training for this a couple a months now –
ever since I got back from that… “weird” war we were in. You remember
that? Here, take it, man! You could still be a hero if you’d
cooperate!</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: Isn’t it obvious that “Chicken Little”
represents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens’ motto, “Let’s go
shopping!” is the cry of the true lunatic?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>p.a system</strong>: – flight 764 for San Francisco is now
ready for boarding at Gate 36.</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: Coma on, Cole, don’t be an asshole. Look, I
got orders, man! You know what I’m sposed to do if you don’t go along?
I’m sposed to shoot the lady! You got that? They said, “If Cole don’t
obey this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his girlfriend!”</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: I got no choice, man. These are my orders.
Just take it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: This part isn’t about the virus, is it?</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: Hey, man…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s about obeying, about doing what you’re
told.</p>
<p><strong>jose</strong>: They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya
want?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Who am I supposed to shoot?</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: James! Thank God! I thought you’d
disappeared. Listen, I think I know who it is! I saw him! It’s
Dr. Mason’s assistant. An apocalypse nut! The next flight to San
Francisco leaves from Gate 38. If he’s there, it has to be him.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I love you, Kathryn. Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Maybe we can stop him. Maybe we can actually
do something.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
letting me have a look at the contents of your bag?</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: Me? Oh, yes, of course. My samples. I
have the appropriate papers.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Oh, God, we don’t have time for this.</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: Biological samples. I have the paperwork
right here.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: I’m going to have to ask you to
open this, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: Open it? Of course.</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: Here! You see? Biological! Check the
papers – it’s all proper. I have a permit.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: It’s empty!</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!
But I assure you, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: Please listen to me – this is very
urgent!</p>
<p><strong>second security officer</strong>: You’ll have to get in line,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>traveler</strong>: We’re all in a hurry, lady. What’s so
special about you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: You see! Also invisible to the naked
eye.</p>
<p><strong>dr. peters</strong>: It doesn’t even have an odor.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: That’s not necessary, sir. Here
you go. Thanks for your cooperation. Have a good flight.</p>
<p><strong>second security officer</strong>: Who are you calling a
“moron”?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Get your hands off her!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I said, get your hands off her. She’s not a
criminal. She’s a doctor…a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>railly</strong>: THERE HE IS! HE’S CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS!
STOP HIM!</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Police Officers. Would you step
over here, please.</p>
<p><strong>first security officer</strong>: HE’S GOT A GUN!</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: STOP OR I’LL SHOOT!</p>
